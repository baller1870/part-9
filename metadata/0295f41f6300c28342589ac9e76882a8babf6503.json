Turns out &quot;executive bonded leather&quot; is really just a fancy term for &quot;not worth the wheels it rolls on&quot;, as my last two chairs have only held up for a couple of years each.  Just long enough for the extended warranty to expire.\n\nAt about 200 or so pops a piece, not wanting to make the same mistake a third time, I've been visiting websites and reading user reviews.  &quot;This chair caused me swass.&quot;  &quot;It squeaks too much.&quot;  &quot;There aren't enough adjustments.&quot;  &quot;I now have a pinched nerve in my back thanks to this chair.&quot;  I could go on.  But simply stated, I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised that those with the worse things to say, wanted to have their voice heard the loudest.\n\nAnd isn't that sometimes true of Christianity too?  Why is it that those with the pointiest criticisms are the ones who crave the largest audiences?  &quot;The choir was terrible today.&quot;  &quot;The Christmas play sucked.&quot;  &quot;The fruit punch (used for the Lord's Supper) is too warm.&quot;  I still remember traveling a few years back, and visiting a Church one Sunday morning during my travels.  It was my first time at that Church.  Ad that's when I overheard someone complaining that their fruit punch wasn't chilled enough.  I couldn't believe it!\n\nWell my fruit punch was just fine.  And if swass turns out to be my biggest problem in selecting a new office chair for myself, then so be it.  After all, being content is a wonderful state of mind.\n\nCOUNTRY: Alabama.
