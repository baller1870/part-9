A development of the cancelled B-1A, the aircraft - while not technically stealth capable - still presents a fraction of the radar profile of the B-52 and incorporates extremely advanced navigation, weapons, and avionics systems. Its swing wing technology, combined with four 30,000-lb thrust turbofan, engines creates a beautiful, fast, and lethal package. The development of this successor to the B-52 began in the early 1960's and resulted in a contract being awarded to Rockwell in 1970. The B-1A first flew in 1974 but soon ran into political trouble. The project was cancelled in 1977 when only 3 prototypes existed. 1981 saw Ronald Reagan order a fleet of 100 B-1Bs, the last of which were delivered in the early 1990's. Designed for low-level, high speed penetration, the B-1B saw action in the Kosovo conflict and second Gulf War.\n\nFor FSX only\n\nFeatures\n\n    4 models spanning the years and 8 faithful paint-schemes:\n        28th BMS(H), 384th BMW(H), McConnell AFB\n        46th BMS(H), 319th BMW(H), Grand Forks AFB\n        37th BMS(H), 28th BMW(H), Ellsworth AFB\n        128th BS, 116th BW, Robins AFB\n        34th BS, 366th BW, Mountain Home AFB, Idaho\n        77th BS, 28th BW, Ellsworth AFB\n        37th BS, 28th BW, Thumrait AB\n        9th BS, 7th BW, Bagram AB\n    native FSX model with all FSX features\n    authentic virtual cockpit with animations and mousable controls\n    many custom interior and exterior animations, eg automatic wingsweep on loadup\n    opening bomb bays with various era-specific payloads\n    animated afterburner cans with realistic flame effects\n    DX10-compatible model with interior self-shadowing\n    beautiful night lighting textures and effects inside and out\n    high-fidelity sounds set from Turbine Sound Studios\n    custom afterburner rumble sound\n    many simulated cockpit systems, including the VSD\n    engine failure and fire modelling\n    researched and authentic flight dynamics\n    note - no 2D panel provided\n    37-page PDF illustrated user manual in .pdf format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3219f0ceef50ba37a4af3ba48371720795e00e38","amp;dn":"VIRTAVIA+-+B-1B+LANCER+FSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3219f0ceef50ba37a4af3ba48371720795e00e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,25,240,206,239,80,186,55,164,175,59,164,131,113,114,7,149,224,14,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
