This collection offers extraordinary artists from several eras ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ legends who have inspired todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s generation, stars of the contemporary jazz world and young women just now starting to make their mark on jazz history. Women of Jazz captures the depth and diversity of the female jazz experience. Women of Jazz includes original songs alongside classic 1920s ballads and Broadway show tunes. A true reflection of the creativity of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s female jazz artists, their songs often combine jazz with unexpected influences such as rhythm and blues and country ballads.\nMelody GardotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodniteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ showcases her subtly hip and swinging style. Madeleine Peyroux, whose sultry voice resembles that of Billie Holiday, turns Leonard CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s folk song into a jazz classic. Sophie Milman, winner of CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2007 Juno award for best jazz vocal album, gives an inspired performance that incorporates gypsy violin and klezmer.\n\nSeveral songs add a contemporary twist to well known tunes. Cassandra Wilson, a world-renowned jazz innovator, provides a modern take on the classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLover Come Back to MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Hope WaitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rendition of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be Satisfied,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a 1950s rhythm and blues hit for crooner Jackie Wilson, sounds as if it had been written today by a contemporary singer-songwriter. Kate Paradise, part of the new generation of jazz musicians, provides her vocal improvisation of the classic tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMean to Me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jennifer Hartswick, who was a guest vocalist on several of the band PhishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recordings, offers a new version of Billie HolidayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLover Man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Also on the collection, rising star Stacy Kent sings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShall We Dance?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from The King and I.\n\nDella Griffin, who sang with doo-wop and jazz groups in New York in the 1950s and spent most of the 1970s and 1980s as the featured artist at HarlemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blue Book Club, offers her interpretation of the jazz standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt Could Happen to You.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Etta Jones, a jazz and blues legend, closes the album with the classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSince I Fell for You.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
