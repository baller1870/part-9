Unlike their later records, \nthe Crowes don't really stretch out and jam that much on Money Maker, but that helps \ndistill their virtues into a handful of memorable singles (&quot;Jealous Again,&quot; &quot;She Talks \nto Angels,&quot; a cover of Otis Redding's &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;), and most of the album tracks \nmaintain an equally high standard. Shake Your Money Maker may not be stunningly \noriginal, but it doesn't need to be; it's the most concise demonstration of the \nfact that The Black Crowes are a great, classic rock &amp; roll band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b216204fa0fcc3972a419e9712d5884055ae4fa","amp;dn":"1990+Black+Crowes%2C+The+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Shake+Your+Money+Maker++24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b216204fa0fcc3972a419e9712d5884055ae4fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,33,98,4,250,15,204,57,114,164,25,233,113,45,88,132,5,90,228,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
