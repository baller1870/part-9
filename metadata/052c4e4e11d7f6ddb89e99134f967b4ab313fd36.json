It was also released in the US as Words and Music by Bob Dylan with a different cover but using the same band image and track order. This album was recorded and released following Graham Nash's departure from the band to join David Crosby and Stephen Stills in mid 1968 after early sessions for a follow-up to the psychedelic concept album, Butterfly broke down. Nash became frustrated when the other band members showed opposition to lyrics in his latest compositions. By that time, Nash was the only member of the band experimenting with LSD and Marijuana and a rift was forming between him and his beer drinking band-mates.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:052c4e4e11d7f6ddb89e99134f967b4ab313fd36","amp;dn":"The+Hollies+-+Hollies+Sing+Dylan+%282013%29+Japan+Mini+LP+SHM-CD+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"052c4e4e11d7f6ddb89e99134f967b4ab313fd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,44,78,78,17,215,246,221,184,158,153,19,79,150,123,74,179,19,253,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
