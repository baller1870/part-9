For UEFI, makes sure the device\nhas &quot;UEFI:&quot; in the description.\n-For Activation, if you didn't use the Upgrade option/offer\nrun Microsoft Toolkit (torrent magnet provided) and select\nWindows button, Activation tab, and EZ-Activator option.*\n*Keep MTK handy somewhere if you ever need to uninstall the\nactivator for some reason. Future MTK versions might not\nbe backward compatible for uninstall or settings changes.\n\nPrivacy Notes:\n-Use the Customize option during OOBE account setup phase\n-Uncheck the stuff that sends data to MS if you value privacy\n-Run both telemetry scripts in the scripts folder\n-Either disable Windows Defender completely or go into\nsettings-&gt;update-&gt;Defender and disable cloud and sample submit\n-Running any Windows App (store type apps) will send data to ms\n-There are some app uninstall tools, but I have not included\nthem as it's far wiser to simply install LTSB version if you\nwant to have a version that lacks apps.\n-There are a few decent privacy apps out there, but they\nare still very over-zealous.\n-I have included a script to turn the search box into a\ncomputer-only search (no internet search)\n-Between telemetry scripts, defender options, and search box,\nmost or all of the spying stuff is blocked.\n-I am unsure about the error reporting as I haven't seen it\nactually send any data in my sniffing, but if you are paranoid\nyou can feel free to disable it in settings-&gt;Privacy\n\nExta Notes:\n-This version does not have a cumulative update integrated.\n-After setup, go into Settings-&gt;Update and let it download\nthe latest update and restart your system.\n-Cumulative updates are being released very often, so this\nis the best way to maintain a very large AIO while still\nbeing able to upgrade and fit on a fat32 UFD.\n-x64-only version has sxs folder removed so that it is\nable to be burned onto a Single Layer DVDR\n-SXS folder is where the offline netfx3 installer is stored\nbut the cumulative update will download a newer version.\n-After setup, if you need to install netfx3, make sure to\ndownload updates first, as it will simply install from\nsystem files after you update.\n-My Netfx3 script is not designed for dual-boot setup, but\nit should do online or system file feature enable just fine.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit KMS Activator\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design, testing, and scripting\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8106cfd8912b17655ef8359484d72116acc6da4c","amp;dn":"Windows+10+AIO+30in1+Base+v2+x32+x64+DaRT10+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8106cfd8912b17655ef8359484d72116acc6da4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,6,207,216,145,43,23,101,94,248,53,148,132,215,33,22,172,198,218,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
