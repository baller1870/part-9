But as Drunk Tank Pink illustrates, the truth is our environment shapes our thoughts and actions in myriad ways without our permission or even our knowledge. Armed with surprising data and endlessly fascinating examples, Adam Alter addresses the subtle but substantial ways in which outside forces influence us such as colorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence on mood, our bias in favor of names with which we identify, and how sunny days can induce optimism as well as aggression. Drunk Tank Pink proves that the truth behind our feelings and actions goes much deeper than the choices we take for granted every day.\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abfd18bf2d21c07e1dd6e48a7ec1bf8a6db4d324","amp;dn":"Drunk+Tank+Pink%3A+And+Other+Unexpected+Forces+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abfd18bf2d21c07e1dd6e48a7ec1bf8a6db4d324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,253,24,191,45,33,192,126,29,214,228,138,126,193,191,138,109,180,211,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
