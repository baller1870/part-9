Having gone through eight in his short life because of his inability to control his supernatural powers, Kim isn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t too excited about his next one. Transferred to the mysterious Volcano High, Kim arrives only to find that he may have found a place where he belongs. There, teachers, students, and some athletic clubs are engaged in a race against one another to find a secret martial arts manuscript, and Kim\\\\\\&amp;#039;s powers just might give one group an edge over the rest. A martial arts comedy that is pure, delightful fun, VOLCANO HIGH sports stellar special effects and mile-a-minute action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b212981c9669f2c3fbc752ab046c38aa06d93d","amp;dn":"Volcano+High+%5Beng%2Fhardsubbed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b212981c9669f2c3fbc752ab046c38aa06d93d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,178,18,152,28,150,105,242,195,251,199,82,171,4,108,56,170,6,217,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
