The dawn chorus has nothing on a  \n                    bunch of pissed-up mates on stolen golf buggies  \n                    serenading old pal Shaun. He's now back in the  \n                    fold, but the gang has some issues... Gadget  \n                    loves Kelly, but she doesn't love him. Woody  \n                    and Milky love Lol, but she isn't sure who she  \n                    loves. Things come to a head when Lol goes back  \n                    home to find her dad Mick has returned to the  \n                    bosom of his family. Shaun, on the other hand,  \n                    is having a great time; the World Cup is  \n                    hotting up, he has friends and a new job in the  \n                    VHS industry. However, his mum is shagging his  \n                    new boss Sandhu, so he's not too happy about  \n                    that! And Gadget gets a surprise when he meets  \n                    Trudy's son Winston.                     \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bf7340e90006f73ef612002e3de56101e4fc86b","amp;dn":"This.Is.England.86.S01E02.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bf7340e90006f73ef612002e3de56101e4fc86b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,247,52,14,144,0,111,115,239,97,32,2,227,222,86,16,30,79,200,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
