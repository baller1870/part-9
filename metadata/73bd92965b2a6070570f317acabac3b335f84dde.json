For her follow-up, the British singer brings much of the same cast back, including Rod Argent and Peter Van Hooke who again co-produce. The result is much the same as the first go round. Musically, The Sweet Keeper is fairly unadventurous -- melodic, jazz-inflected adult pop with touches of folk. The only real moments that resonate are the tracks on which Sonny Landreth adds guitar. Lyrically, Tikaram is somewhat impenetrable, often going in circles that are so personal they leave the listener baffled. However, it's hard to resist that voice, husky and sounding more world-wise than her years. If it weren't for her voice, The Sweet Keeper would be easy to disregard. As things are, it's worth a listen, especially the Tikaram's hushed delivery on &quot;It All Came Back Today.&quot; \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73bd92965b2a6070570f317acabac3b335f84dde","amp;dn":"Tanita+Tikaram...The+Sweet+Keeper%281990%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73bd92965b2a6070570f317acabac3b335f84dde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,189,146,150,91,42,96,112,87,15,49,122,202,186,195,179,53,248,77,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
