The first song with 'Boogie Woogie' in the title. The main right hand riff in Pinetop's Boogie Woogie has been used, and is still used, with variations, in numerous songs in blues, jazz and rock.\n\n2) Honky Tonk Train Blues, by Meade Lux Lewis. A boogie woogie masterpiece. You can hear the steam powered train rolling along the railroad track while listening to this song.\n\n3) Boogie Woogie Stomp, by Albert Ammons. Boogie Woogie Stomp is in essence a spiced up and further developed instrumental set piece version of Pinetop's Boogie Woogie. This tune still poses a challenge for every aspiring boogie woogie pianist, mostly because of the complicated chorded left hand.\n\n\nYou will also find a number of songs by the great boogie woogie pianist Pete Johnson.
