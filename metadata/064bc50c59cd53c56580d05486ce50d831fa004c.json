It introduces the use of the very well-known and proven methodology, linear programming, but specially adapted for this purpose. For this, it incorporates a method to include subjective concepts, as well as the possibility of working with many different and even contradictory objectives. The book is liberally populated with diverse case studies to illustrate the concepts. This practical guide will be of interest to anyone undertaking analysis and decision-making, on both simple and complex projects, and who is looking for a strategy to organize, classify, and evaluate the large amount of information required to make an informed decision. The strategy includes methods to analyze the results and extract conclusions from them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064bc50c59cd53c56580d05486ce50d831fa004c","amp;dn":"+Strategy+for+Using+Multicriteria+Analysis+in+Decision-Making","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064bc50c59cd53c56580d05486ce50d831fa004c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,75,197,12,89,205,83,197,101,128,208,84,134,206,80,216,49,250,0,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
