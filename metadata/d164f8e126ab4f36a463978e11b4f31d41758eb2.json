It was released on 20 January 1967 in the United Kingdom and 11 February 1967 in the United States as the follow-up to the ambitious Aftermath. Between the Buttons is seen as the beginning of the Stone's first complete departure from their R&amp;B roots and the beginning of their brief foray into psychedelia.\n\nIn 2003, the American version of the album featuring &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot; was ranked number 355 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nUK Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written by Jagger/Richards.\n\n\n01. \t&quot;Yesterday's Papers&quot;   \t2:04\n02. \t&quot;My Obsession&quot;   \t3:17\n03. \t&quot;Back Street Girl&quot;   \t3:27\n04. \t&quot;Connection&quot;   \t2:08\n05. \t&quot;She Smiled Sweetly&quot;   \t2:44\n06. \t&quot;Cool, Calm &amp; Collected&quot;   \t4:17\n07. \t&quot;All Sold Out&quot;   \t2:17\n08. \t&quot;Please Go Home&quot;   \t3:17\n09. \t&quot;Who's Been Sleeping Here?&quot;   \t3:55\n10. \t&quot;Complicated&quot;   \t3:15\n11. \t&quot;Miss Amanda Jones&quot;   \t2:47\n12. \t&quot;Something Happened to Me Yesterday&quot;   \t4:55\n\n\nUS Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot;   \t3:38\n02. \t&quot;Yesterday's Papers&quot;   \t2:01\n03. \t&quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;   \t3:16\n04. \t&quot;Connection&quot;   \t2:08\n05. \t&quot;She Smiled Sweetly&quot;   \t2:44\n06. \t&quot;Cool, Calm &amp; Collected&quot;   \t4:17\n07. \t&quot;All Sold Out&quot;   \t2:17\n08. \t&quot;My Obsession&quot;   \t3:20\n09. \t&quot;Who's Been Sleeping Here?&quot;   \t3:55\n10. \t&quot;Complicated&quot;   \t3:15\n11. \t&quot;Miss Amanda Jones&quot;   \t2:47\n12. \t&quot;Something Happened to Me Yesterday&quot;   \t4:55\n\n\nSINGLES [320k MP3]\n\nLet's Spend The Night Together\nRuby Tuesday","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d164f8e126ab4f36a463978e11b4f31d41758eb2","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Between+The+Buttons+%5BUK+and+US%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d164f8e126ab4f36a463978e11b4f31d41758eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,100,248,225,38,171,79,54,164,99,151,142,17,180,243,29,65,117,142,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
