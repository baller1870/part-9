From Alec Ramsay and the Black's first meeting on an ill-fated ship to their adventures on a desert island and their eventual rescue, this beloved story will hold the rapt attention of readers new and old. \n\nIn this first book of the series, young Alec Ramsey and the Black are stranded on a desert island after their ship sinks. Dependent on each other for survival, the boy and horse learn to trust and love each other as they establish an amazing friendship that lasts a lifetime. After they are rescued, Alec befriends a retired trainer, Henry Dailey, and they begin training him to race in secret. They enter the Black as a mystery horse in a match race between two champions, Cyclone and Sun Raider, which turns out to be the race of the century.\n\n&quot;The Black Stallion is about the most famous fictional horse of the century.&quot; --The New York Times\n\nAbout the Author\nWalter Farley's first book, The Black Stallion, was an instant hit when it appeared in 1941. Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel, The Young Black Stallion, written with his son Steven.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497d0ff0f5a52fdbf663ae2ee6b1e8bcfd5d9ad4","amp;dn":"THE+BLACK+STALLION+-+Walter+Farley.+Read+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497d0ff0f5a52fdbf663ae2ee6b1e8bcfd5d9ad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,125,15,240,245,165,47,219,246,99,174,46,230,177,232,188,253,93,154,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
