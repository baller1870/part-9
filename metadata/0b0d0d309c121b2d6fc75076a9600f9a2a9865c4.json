From the last show of the '72-'74 incarnation on July 1st, 1974.\n&quot;This was the first gig since the 1969 Crimson where the bottom of my spine registered &quot;out of this world&quot; to the same degree. The 1969 outfit began at the top and then disappeared. This team took two years to get to the same point of being-out-there-ness. As the sun went down and we moved into the ominous bass riff emerging from the &quot;Starless&quot; vocal, red stage lights faded up from behind the band. For me, a stunning theatrical moment highlighting the tension within the piece and the group: a moment of resonance&quot;. - Robert Fripp\nTracks:\n1. Walk On ...

Originally scheduled for August, 2000). From the legendary free concert headlined by the Rolling Stones, in Hyde Park, London in 1969.\n&quot;It would sound blasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© to say that this was just another gig for us, though in a sense it was; we were having a great time discovering and enjoying our music, but we were also experienced enough individually not to be too greatly affected by any particular venue. Nevertheless, there was a definite sense of occasion as we took the stage and hit Schizoid for the thousands of British hippies and devotees of contemporary culture laid out on the grass before us in a seemingly endless ocean of colour.&quot; - Ian McDonald\nTracks:\n1. 21st Century Schizoid Man\n2.

King Crimson Live in Mainz, Germany, March 30th 1974.\n&quot;As a performing group, we had been developing a style of improvisation which I believe was unique to this quartet. Most of the improv bands at the time would have been Jazz, but we were the only artists to operate in a &quot;rock&quot; environment. Our beefy rhythm section was crowned by an outstanding soloing team of Robert and David, and my monitors were inevitably de-throned by the firepower of the band.&quot; - John Wetton\nTracks:\n1.

King Crimson, Live in Nashville, TN, November 9 &amp; 10 2001.\n&quot;We sounded fantastically powerful, that much I know. But, we did have some spectacularly sour moments. We wouldn't want to let Nashville down by leaving out the 'brown moments', now would we? Nashville has always seen the beginning shows of our tours, so they are especially privy to our first meanderings within these pieces. We have a new stage set-up. Pat on the left up front.

King Crimson Champaign-Urbana Sessions, January 1983.\n&quot;A perilous moment for an established band is the writing and recording period that follows a successful album and tour. The momentum of touring, even touring that tires and exhausts the players, propels band life forwards. Audiences cheer; new situations and places and people provide distractions from the inevitable frictions that arise between touring musicians who spend more time with each other than with their close families and friends.\nKing Crimson's failure to recognise or develop the material available from these Champaign-Urbana sessions of 1983 was paralleled 14 years later by the Nashville sessions (CLUB13) of May 1997.&quot; - Robert Fripp\nTracks:\n1.

King Crimson Live in Guildford, November 13, 1972\n&quot;The Muir-era line-up has always been surrounded with an air of mystery partly due to the lack of reliable documentation which has been available. However, the small but growing number of releases and interview material which have begun to emerge in recent years has put the spotlight of scrutiny on this line-up. Were they as good as everyone claims? Listening to this album it's clear that the power that swept off the stage and into the unsuspecting audience in the gloom of Guildford's Civic Hall remains undiminished and nothing short of astonishing. If you were there that night then you were very lucky indeed.&quot; - Sid Smith\nTracks:\n1. Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Part I)\n2. Book Of Saturday (Daily Games)\n3.

King Crimson Live at Fillmore East, November 21 &amp; 22, 1969\n&quot;The Fillmore East concerts in New York 1969 were an important landmark for King Crimson. The band had, in the space of only nine months, risen from obscurity to international recognition, and the American tour was a crucial part of this process. The two nights are enjoyably different, including the recovery from &quot;dropped stitches&quot;. The band is in consistently good form, especially on A Man A City and Schizoid Man, which are taken at blistering speed, and in my opinion, the best way, because if the fast sections are too comfortable the half speed sections become relatively ponderous. So I'm pleased to have found this Fillmore East tape, and hope that it is as valuable to the collector as it is to me.&quot; - Michael Giles\nTracks:\nNovember 21, 1969\n1.

King Crimson Live in Philadelphia, PA, July 30, 1982\n&quot;...to this pair of ears, of all the 80s, this performance from Philadelphia is the best yet. Why? Well, in a team-band like Crimson it might seem unfair to single out individuals but if pushed, I would have to say it was down to Adrian Belew. It's difficult to avoid his dazzling fiery presence on this outing.... Thela Hun Ginjeet packs a devastating punch; a knockout collision between on-the-fly improvisation and the canny judgement of what makes a good story great....Another highlight in this package is the inclusion of The Howler. This song didn't get too many public outings, so it's a pleasure to hear how blistering it is with Belew at his rat-scratching best. It'll come as no surprise when I say this version knocks spots off its studio counterpart.&quot; - Sid Smith\nTracks:\n1. Thela Hun Ginjeet\n2. Red\n3. The Howler\n4. Frame By Frame\n5.

Perhaps it is Chopin, one of the classical composers who's music I most identify with. I don't know. The venue tonight was doing a long run of Peter Pan. We just came in for the two nights and then they would go back to their Peter production. What this meant was that all of the stage props were behind us and just off the stage.

When The Mincer appeared on Starless &amp; Bible Black it represented a new way of approaching the process for Crimson; taking live improvisations and then editing and over-dubbing new parts to create an interesting hybrid. In an exclusive interview, Crimson violinist David Cross talks about this approach in the liner notes to this concert. Although parts of this show recorded at Zurich's Volkhaus on the 15th November 1973 have been previously released on disc 4 of the Great Deceiver box set, this is the first time the entire performance that night has seen the light of day. Using bootleg sources to restore that section of the gig originally excised to create The Mincer, David Singleton and Alex Mundy have recreated an evening of music which underscores CrimsonOs reputation as one of the classic must-see live acts of the 70s.\n\nDavid Cross - violin, mellotron, electric piano\nRobert Fripp - guitar, mellotron, electric piano\nJohn Wetton - bass guitar, vocals\nBill Bruford - drums, percussion\nDisc 1:\n1 Walk On...
