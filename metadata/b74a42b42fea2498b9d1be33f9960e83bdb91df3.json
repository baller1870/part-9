She robs Dionysus of his memory to teach him a lesson in humility.\n\nAriadne is deeply hurt after Dionysus dismisses their night of passion as &quot;just sex&quot; and doesn't want to see her anymore. When she finds him bloodied and beaten and suffering from amnesia, she quickly forms a plan to get back at him. As she pretends to be his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Ariadne makes Dionysus believe he loves her. But the longer the charade continues, the more difficult it becomes to really see who teaches whom a lesson.\n\nAnd what if Dionysus gains his memory back? Will there be hell to pay for her deception, or can a mortal woman truly win a god's love?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74a42b42fea2498b9d1be33f9960e83bdb91df3","amp;dn":"A+Scent+of+Greek+-+Tina+Folsom+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74a42b42fea2498b9d1be33f9960e83bdb91df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,74,66,180,47,234,36,152,185,209,190,51,249,150,14,131,189,185,29,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
