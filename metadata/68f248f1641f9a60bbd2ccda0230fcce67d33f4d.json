He is a respected spiritual medium that has spirit wrote more that 400 books and has given all the profits to charity. Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, Chico Xavier was elected in 2002 one of the most important Brazilians of the 20th century. He died at 92 years of age and left behind a great number of followers and admirerers.\n\n\nREVIEW:\n\nA great opportunity to get to know who was Chico Xavier, a man called love!\n\nIt's a quite hard work to portrait the essence of Chico Xavier's life. Although he lived 92 years and psycho-graphed more than 400 books, Chico Xavier's life was, above all superlatives, an example of charity, love to his fellowman, resignation, patience and true Christian humbleness. Not even his written works are more important than his example as a good man.\n\nThe movie, based on Marcel Souto Maior's best-seller As Vidas de Chico Xavier (The Lives of Chico Xavier), portraits his life from the age of 9 (performed by the incredible boy-actor Matheus Costa) until his adulthood.
