The comprehensive and thoroughly up-to-date handbook presents the sources, identification, analysis, biosynthesis, biotechnology and applications of important polysaccharides likes starches, cellulose, chitin, gum and microbial polysaccharides.\n\nAbout the Authors\nProf. Dr. Kishan G. Ramawat is Former Professor &amp; Head of the Botany Department, M.L. Sukhadia University, Udaipur, India, and can look back on longstanding research experience. He received his Ph.D. in Plant Biotechnology in 1978 from the University of Jodhpur, India and afterwards joined the university as a faculty member. In 1991 he moved to the M.L.Sukhadia University in Udaipur as Associate Professor and became Professor in 2001. He served as the Head of the Department of Botany, was in charge of the Department of Biotechnology. Prof. Ramawat had done his postdoctoral studies at the University of Tours, France from 1983-85, and later returned to Tours as visiting professor (1991). He also visited the University of Bordeaux 2, France several times as visiting professor , and in 2005 Poland in an academic exchange programme. Through these visits in France, Prof. Ramawat and Prof. MÃƒÂ©rillon established a strong connection, which has resulted in productive collaborations and several book and reference work publications. Prof. Ramawat has published more than 170 well cited peer reviewed papers and articles, and edited several books and reference works. He is an active member of several academic bodies, associations and editorial boards of journals.\nProfesseur Dr. Jean-Michel MeÃ‚Â´rillon is the Ã‚Â« Directeur de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢EA 3675 Ã‚Â», at the FaculteÃ‚Â´ de Pharmacie, UniversiteÃ‚Â´ de Bordeaux, France. He received his M.Pharma. (1979) and Ph.D. (1984) from the University of Tours in France. He joined the University of Tours as assistant professor in 1981, became associate professor in 1987. In 1993 he moved to the faculty of Pharmacy, University of Bordeaux, France, accepting a position as full professor. He is involved in developing teaching on plant biology, natural bioactive compounds and biotechnology.  Prof. MÃƒÂ©rillon has published more than 145 research papers in internationally recognized journals, resulting in an H index of 35 (documents published between 1996 and 2015). He has co-edited books and reference works on secondary metabolites and biotechnology. Throughout his career, Prof. MÃƒÂ©rillon has traveled widely as a senior professor. Scientists from several countries have been and are working in his laboratory.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s28.postimg.org/4mpbeu7hp/Polysaccharides_Bioactivity_and_Biotechnology.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s28.postimg.org/4mpbeu7hp/Polysaccharides_Bioactivity_and_Biotechnology.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6d247afb18ed5a169f4a64dec705a11b7593da","amp;dn":"Polysaccharides+-+Bioactivity+and+Biotechnology+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6d247afb18ed5a169f4a64dec705a11b7593da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,109,36,122,251,24,237,90,22,159,74,100,222,199,5,161,27,117,147,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
