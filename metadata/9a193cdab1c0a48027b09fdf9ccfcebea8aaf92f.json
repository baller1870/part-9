They are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music.[1] From 1962, the group consisted of John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals) and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals). Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the group later worked in many genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. The nature of their enormous popularity, which first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, transformed as their songwriting grew in sophistication. They came to be perceived as the embodiment of ideals of the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.\n\nInitially a five-piece line-up of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe (bass) and Pete Best (drums), they built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Sutcliffe left the group in 1961, and Best was replaced by Starr the following year. Moulded into a professional outfit by their manager, Brian Epstein, their musical potential was enhanced by the creativity of producer George Martin. They achieved mainstream success in the United Kingdom in late 1962, with their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;. Gaining international popularity over the course of the next year, they toured extensively until 1966, then retreated to recording studios until their break-up in 1970. Each then found success in independent musical careers.\n\nDuring their studio years, they produced what critics consider some of their finest material including the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), widely regarded as a masterpiece. They are the best-selling band in the history of popular music,[2][3] and four decades after their break-up, their recordings are still in demand. They have had more number one albums on the UK charts and have held the top spot longer than any other musical act.[4] According to the RIAA, they have sold more albums in the United States than any other artist.[5] The Beatles were placed at number one on Billboard magazine's fiftieth-anniversary list of all-time top Hot 100 artists in 2008.[6] They have received 7 Grammy Awards from the American National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences[7] and 15 Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.[8] They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.[9] Lennon was murdered outside his home in New York City in 1980, and Harrison died of cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain active. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthology 1 1995\n\n\nAnthology 1 is a compilation album by The Beatles, released by Apple Records in November 1995. It was released as the first part of the Anthology trilogy of albums with Anthology 2 and Anthology 3, all of which tie-in with the televised special The Beatles Anthology. It contains &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;, billed as the first new Beatles song in 25 years. The album topped the Billboard 200 album chart and was certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA. The Anthology albums were made available on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011.\n\nAnthology 1 features rarities, outtakes and live performances from the period 1958ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1964, including their days as &quot;The Quarrymen&quot;, through the Decca audition to sessions for the album Beatles for Sale. It is of historical interest for the only official release of performances with Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best during the time they were in the band. Sutcliffe, the band's original bass player during 1960 and sporadically during their second Hamburg season, is featured on the disc one tracks &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot;, &quot;You'll Be Mine&quot; and &quot;Cayenne&quot;. Best, who was the band's drummer from just prior to their first departure for Hamburg in August 1960 until 15 August 1962, is featured on disc one tracks 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12, 15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“19 and 21ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“22.\n\nDisc one tracks 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12 were recorded at a session in Hamburg where The Beatles served as the back-up band to the English rock and roll musician Tony Sheridan. Some songs from this session were release on the 1962 LP My Bonnie, credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers. The song &quot;My Bonnie&quot; would be their introductory single in England, featuring Sheridan on lead vocal and guitar. Disc one tracks 21ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“22 are the only surviving recordings of The Beatles' first EMI session. Track 22 is the original recording of &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, which, after Ringo Starr replaced Best, would be re-recorded by the group four months later for their first single. Disc one track 23 features EMI session drummer Andy White in place of Starr.\n\nDisc two contains performances from comedy duo Morecambe and Wise's popular television programme, Two of a Kind, as well as the opening song from their famed performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which introduced the band to most of the US in 1964.\n\nThe flashpoint for the album came with the song &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the three remaining Beatles Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr re-working a John Lennon demo recording given to McCartney by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono Lennon. Produced by Harrison's Traveling Wilburys band-mate Jeff Lynne, the three added additional music and lyrics, instrumentation and backing vocals, with McCartney and Harrison both taking a turn at a lead vocal.\n\nThe cover of Anthology 1 is the first third of the Anthology collage made by Klaus Voorman. Various photographs and album covers are torn and collected together. Pete Best's face was torn away from the Savage Young Beatles record jacket in the centre of the album cover, revealing the face of his successor, Ringo Starr, below. The missing piece was subsequently used on the cover of Best's Haymans Green album in 2008.\n\nThe album was a large success throughout the world. It was the first Beatles album to officially enter the Billboard 200 album chart straight at number 1 with 855,473 copies sold, making the 27th largest one-week sales in the Soundscan history, succeeding Fresh Horses by Garth Brooks. In its second week Anthology 1 sold 453,000 copies and maintained the top spot. This was repeated the following week, with 435,000 copies sold. In its fourth week the same quantity was sold, but the album fell to #2 behind Mariah Carey's Daydream. In the following week, the album fell to #3 but with 601,000 sales. Anthology 1 was certified 3ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ Platinum by the RIAA after six weeks in the US market. In all, the album spent 29 weeks inside the Billboard 200, reached cumulative sales of 3,639,000 scans as of April 2001. In the UK, reaction was similar, but the album only reached #2, behind Robson &amp; Jerome's eponymous album. In Australia, the album spent two weeks at #1 in December 1995.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Free as a Bird&quot; (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25 \no\tLennon demo recorded at The Dakota, New York City, 1977;
