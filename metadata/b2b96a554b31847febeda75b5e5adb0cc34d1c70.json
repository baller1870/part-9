It was released in North America on June 23, 2008, followed by a European release on June 26.[2][3] The game was hinted at just before the release of Battlefield 2,[4] and then announced sixteen months later.[5] A sequel, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on March 2, 2010.\n\nBad Company puts the player in a fictional war between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, where players will lead a squad of soldiers fighting Russians, MEC (Middle East Coalition) troops and Legionnaire mercenaries.\n\nThe game applies some new features to the franchise, including an environment that can be almost destroyed (besides the very basic supports of buildings and certain metallic structures like antennae),[6] and a single-player storyline. The single-player campaign and some multiplayer maps take place in Europe, in the fictional Eastern European country of Serdaristan, and an unnamed fictional Middle Eastern country of the MEC in a city called Sadiz, which is located somewhere on the Caspian Sea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b96a554b31847febeda75b5e5adb0cc34d1c70","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Bad+Company+1++++++%5BPAL%5D+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b96a554b31847febeda75b5e5adb0cc34d1c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,185,106,85,75,49,132,127,235,237,167,91,94,90,219,12,195,77,28,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
