And when given something worthy of her talents--&quot;Killing Me Softly With His Song&quot;, for example--she positively shone; her reading of Ewan MacColl's &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; (the undoubted highlight here) ranks as one of pop's most unforgettable moments, a genuinely transcendent masterpiece. But times change, and nowhere is the decline in Flack's artistic fortunes more evident than in her choice of collaborator: from her work in the 1970s with the brilliant Donny Hathaway (who duets here on &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; and &quot;Back Together Again&quot;), through the 1980s, and the wretched Peabo Bryson (&quot;Tonight, I Celebrate My Love&quot;), right up to the obligatory &quot;House Mix&quot; of &quot;Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)&quot;, a moronic slice of euro-disco. Yet despite the paucity of the material, that voice could still melt a glacier.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n[02] Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\n[03] Where Is The Love\t\t\t- With Donny Hathaway\n[04] Killing Me Softly With His Song\n[05] Feel Like Makin' Love\n[06] The Closer I Get To You\n[07] More Than Everything\n[08] Only Heaven Can Wait\n[09] Back Together Again\t\t\t- With Donny Hathaway\n[10] Making Love\n[11] Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\t\t- With Peabo Bryson\n[12] Oasis\n[13] And So It Goes\n[14] You Know What It's Like\n[15] Set The Night To Music\t\t\t- With Maxi Priest\n[16] My Foolish Heart\n[17] Uh-Uh OOh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes) \t- [Steve Hurley's House Mix]\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:16m:20s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 184mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B Soul\n\nOriginally Released\t- 22 June 1993\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Atlantic Recording\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.robertaflack.com \n \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b134bb0571cd9b24d16962047e6a006759d929c7","amp;dn":"%5B1993%5D+The+Best+Of+%28Softly+With+These+Songs%29+-+Roberta+Flack+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b134bb0571cd9b24d16962047e6a006759d929c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,52,187,5,113,205,155,36,209,105,98,4,126,106,0,103,89,217,41,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
