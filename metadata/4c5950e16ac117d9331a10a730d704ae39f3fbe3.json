Often times, it is difficult to even know where to begin.     \n So, we have put together a structured course that guides users through the        \n learning process.  Inspirtech sets itself apart from the competition with a       \n unique and highly effective holistic approach to teaching.  Lessons are filled    \n with engaging examples and exercises that are just enough to inspire confidence,  \n yet not too much to confuse and frustrate the learner.  Upon completion of the    \n course, learners will be prepared to challenge the CSWA exam. Training features   \n SolidWorks intigration to give users access to all of the videos from the inside  \n of SolidWorks Software.\n\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n                                  Install Notes (Windows)                         \n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n                                                                                  \n 1.
