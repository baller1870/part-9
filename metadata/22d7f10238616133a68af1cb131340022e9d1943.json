For those readers who have followed this remarkable talent since the beginning, here are all those amazing stories gathered together in one place, with some extra surprises as well. \n\nFor the hundreds of thousands who are newly come to Card, here is chance to experience the wonder of a writer so versatile that he can handle everything from traditional narrative poetry to modern experimental fiction with equal ease and grace. The brilliant story-telling of the Alvin Maker books is no accident; the breathless excitement evoked by the Ender books is not a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n\nIn this enormous volume are forty-six stories, plus ten long, intensely personal essays, unique to this volume. In them the author reveals some of his reasons and motivations for writing, with a good deal of autobiography into the bargain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d7f10238616133a68af1cb131340022e9d1943","amp;dn":"Maps+in+a+Mirror++by+Orson+Scott+Card","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d7f10238616133a68af1cb131340022e9d1943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,215,241,2,56,97,97,51,166,138,241,203,19,19,64,2,46,157,25,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
