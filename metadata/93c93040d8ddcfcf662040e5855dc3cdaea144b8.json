These explanations describe relevant controls, troubleshooting, and reaction components for some of the most widely used neuroscience protocols that remain difficult for many neuroscientists to implement successfully. Having this additional information will help researchers ensure that their experiments work the first time, and will also minimize the time spent working on a technique only to discover that the problem was them, and not their materials.\n\n\n\nDescribes techniques in very specific detail with Step-by-step instructions, giving researchers in depth understanding\nOffers many details not present in other protocol books\nDescribes relevant controls for each technique and what those controls mean\nChapters include references (key articles, books, protocols) for additional study\nDescribes both the techniques and the habits necessary to get quality results, such as aseptic technique, aliquoting, and general laboratory rules","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c93040d8ddcfcf662040e5855dc3cdaea144b8","amp;dn":"Basic+Molecular+Protocols+in+Neuroscience+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c93040d8ddcfcf662040e5855dc3cdaea144b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,201,48,64,216,221,207,207,102,32,64,229,133,93,195,205,174,161,68,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
