It incorporates all the latest technological advances, including replacing plain radiographs with digital radiographs, changes in imaging protocols and the role of portable US and multidetector CT.\n\nWith over 400 illustrations and annotated radiographs, this thoroughly revised third edition provides more images, new illustrations, and new chapters on emergency US and CT that reflect current practice. Each chapter starts with radiological anatomy, standard and then additional views, a systematic approach to interpretation (ABC approach) and followed by a review of common abnormalities.\n\nThe ABC of Emergency Radiology is an invaluable resource for accident and emergency staff, trainee radiologists, medical students, nurses, radiographers and all medical personnel involved in the immediate care of trauma patients","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37707cc0c1d13b5158cc07b364b100639ed426e2","amp;dn":"ABC+of+Emergency+Radiology%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37707cc0c1d13b5158cc07b364b100639ed426e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,112,124,192,193,209,59,81,88,204,7,179,100,177,0,99,158,212,38,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
