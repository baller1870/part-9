rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_13&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you are going to make a movie intended solely for kung fu movie fans then Chang Cheh would be first on the list of most wanted directors. The story is about a group of super tough dudes called the Shanghai 13 and the 13 of them have joined the side of the enemy while some are on the side of good. The good ones are supposed to protect a guy named Mr. Gau who has an important document that he needs to deliver. There is a little subplot going on with Ricky Tien towards the end but that is literally the whole story explained in 2 or 3 sentences. Just the way I like it, it is only the fights that you have to pay attention to. I will go ahead and tell you every fight that you can expect to see because if you have never seen this then you will never believe me that all of these HUGE stars show up and you defintely won't believe how many great fights they have.\n\nJimmy Wang Yu has a cameo at the start helping Mr. Gau retrieve the document that he will have to deliver. Danny Lee is a sniper who is looking to take out Mr. Gau while he is staying at Chen Kuan Tai's place.\n These 3 big name actors are the only ones with non fighting cameos but Kuan Tai is guaranteed not to dissapoint. All of the fights are spectacular and Chiang Sheng has the first one. Like 'Kid With the Golden Arm' we get the comic book feeling in this first big fight. The others that follow will only amaze you even more. Next Wang Chung('The Water Margin') has a great fight where he pulls out these metal spikes to put on his hand.\n Lu Feng looks to take out Leung Kar-Yan with a bunch of his men and then Andy Lau shows up for a 5 minute fight. Andy Lau is super young and his fight is great but he does stick out like a sore thumb as the worst screen fighter but that is probably only because he follows the best scene of the movie.\n Next Chi Kuan-Chun shows up to fight a guy I can't name that has some good legwork. You can also see him in '9 Demons' and he and David Chiang are great in this scene. But are they enough to take on Kuan-Chun's secret weapon? We meet Ricky Tien playing the Butcher next and this guy would make Phillip Kwok and Chiang Sheng's jaws drop in amazement because of his acrobatics.\n You will of course know Ricky from Chinese Super Ninjas and other odd Chang Cheh movies. 'Shanghai 13' is a perfect blend of all of Cheh's older stars and the new ones as well.\n\nSort of like '7 Grandmasters' the end of the movie is a letdown only because all that led up to it was the greatest thing you have ever seen.\n They could have had Ricky, Ti Lung, and Chen Sing develop their characters when they showed up at the end but I would rather see them have an all out brawl for the last 20 minutes. That's just me.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/L45Y6Cu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/L45Y6Cu&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
