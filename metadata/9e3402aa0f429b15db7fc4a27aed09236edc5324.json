The mini suite, &quot;Solarization,&quot; not only showcases the band's technical abilities, but also Cobham's strong compositional skills. It also features a schizophrenic piano solo (&quot;Second Phase&quot;) from the underrated pianist Milcho Leviev, who sounds like a mutation of Cecil Taylor and Bill Evans. The funky &quot;Moon Germs,&quot; on which John Abercrombie is pushed to inspiring new heights, became a Cobham classic. &quot;The Moon Ain't Made of Green Cheese&quot; is a beautiful flugel horn solo by Randy Brecker backed by Cobham's debut on piano. The band stretches out on the lengthy &quot;Sea of Tranquility,&quot; while &quot;Last Frontier&quot; is a gratuitous drum solo. This recording is highly recommended as Cobham still sounds inspired. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3402aa0f429b15db7fc4a27aed09236edc5324","amp;dn":"Billy+Cobham+-+Total+Eclipse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e3402aa0f429b15db7fc4a27aed09236edc5324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,52,2,170,15,66,155,21,219,127,196,162,122,237,9,35,110,220,83,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
