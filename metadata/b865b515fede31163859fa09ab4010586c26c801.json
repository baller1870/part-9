Taking on the likenesses of Green Day members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Cool, players progress through the story and history of Green Day, gaining access into the band's media vault, where they can unlock more than 100 collectible images, and more than 40 minutes of rare and unreleased video from interviews, outtakes and performances.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nI originally downloaded this from http://www.heroturko.org/games/wii/213249-green-day-rock-band-usa-wii-procision-ntsc-usother2010.html\n\nIt was split into 91 pieces, and then split into 18 bigger pieces, and that made it a hassle.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nTested on a softmoded 4.1U Wii... So blame your h4(k1n6 5k1||z if it doesn't work.\n\nThis torrent contains 45 .7z parts.  Download, extract, burn.  For a free alternative to WinRAR, use 7zip. (google 7zip)\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nSpeaking of burning:\n\n1. Open up your favorite ISO burner (PowerISO or imageburn are nice free ones)\n2. Get a high quality 4.7GB DVD-R (I use Philips)\n3. Burn it as slow as you can (4x is ideal)\n4. Enjoy.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nIf you would, please leave comments saying &quot;thank you&quot; or &quot;you rock&quot; after downloading.\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nCAUTION!  THIS GAME WILL UPDATE YOUR WII TO SYSTEM MENU 4.2U, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT DELETE YOUR HOMEBREW CHANNEL, and STUB YOUR CUSTOM IOSes.  Use Dop-Mii to safely update your Wii (like you really need system menu 4.2U...) or use Wii Start Patch to disable disk updates. (wii start patch: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/StartPatch )\n\nAlso a thing to note, your Green Day RB2 DLC may not work on this game.  It all depends on what cIOS version your using.  I use cIOSCorp 3.6, and DLC will not work for this game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b865b515fede31163859fa09ab4010586c26c801","amp;dn":"%5BWii%5D+Green+Day+Rock+Band+%5BNTSC-USA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b865b515fede31163859fa09ab4010586c26c801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,101,181,21,254,222,49,22,56,89,250,9,171,64,16,88,108,38,200,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
