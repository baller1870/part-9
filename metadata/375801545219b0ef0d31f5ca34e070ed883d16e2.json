They deduce the best way to track \nRonnie is to find Dr. Martin Stein who was \nworking on a project called F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. \nBarry struggles to balance his duties as The \nFlash and his relationship with Linda Park, \nand Joe enlists Cisco's help to reinvestigate \nthe murder of Nora Allen. \n\n17/Slower\nEvolve... or die.\n\nSd = 19/20, 720p = 18/19, so, 1080p = 17/18.\n\nWere a few requests for these, so we figured \nwhy not? We will only be doing a select few\nshows, and we will not do any from OTA/Cable/\netc, they just are not good enough for 1080 \nencodes. \nSize and audio may vary.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375801545219b0ef0d31f5ca34e070ed883d16e2","amp;dn":"The.Flash.2014.S01E13.1080p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375801545219b0ef0d31f5ca34e070ed883d16e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,88,1,84,82,25,176,239,13,49,245,202,52,224,112,237,136,61,22,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
