He was born in 1939 in Heraklion, Crete.\n\n\n In 1969 Markopoulos returned to Athens with a musical vision that would not only change the course of music in Greece but would also lend immediate moral support to the general demand for restoration of democracy, the struggle being led primarily by university students and intellectuals. \nHe founded a new and highly distinctive musical ensemble which included Greek local instruments. Thus the piano was combined with the lyre for the first time, while he also added instruments of his own invention, particularly among the percussion, with the intention of enriching the variety of sounds. \nThe composerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision had materialised and a new musical wave had been born which he termed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Return to the RootsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He defined it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a project for the future involving the process of examination, evaluation and selection of the indestructible sources of our living traditions in combination with selected contemporary art forms and elementsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: the outcome was an exceptionally original sound emerging from the unique tone colours stemming from the unaccustomed blends of instruments and voices.
