Duration:\t16 min. 32 sec.\n===================================================================================\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to install the Java SDK (Software Development Kit), the JRE (Java Runtime Environment), and Dr. Java (a Java IDE). You will also learn how to write the famous \\&quot;Hello World!\\&quot; application.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 02: Math                                       Duration:\t07 min. 20 sec.\n===================================================================================\nLearn all about math operations in this lesson. We will go over the basic math functions of the Java language, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, modulus, as well as some important functions of the Math class in java.lang.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 03: Bitwise Operators                          Duration:\t09 min. 11 sec.\n===================================================================================\nWhy do you need to know bitwise operators? You don\\'t!! However, if you don\\'t know binary, I strongly recommend this lesson to get your brain thinking like a computer.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 04: Math Class                                 Duration:\t14 min. 52 sec.\n===================================================================================\nThis is more of a Math Part II. We are going to delve into the ever-so-handy Math class in the Java API. Therefore, we also learn how to reference the API in times of need. This is a very crucial lesson if you have dreams of doing any self-experimentalization with Java.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 05: Variables                                  Duration:\t18 min. 20 sec. \n===================================================================================\nVariables are probably the most crucial component to any programming language. Learn the EIGHT primitive data types in Java and the use for each. Learn how to declare variables and how to work with them in your programs.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 06: Functions                                  Duration:\t16 min. 50 sec.\n===================================================================================\nIn this lesson you will learn about the creation of functions in Java. These will become quite useful!\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 07: If Statements                              Duration:\t21 min. 46 sec.\n===================================================================================\nIn this lesson, learn about if statements and Boolean logic. It\\'s 20 minutes long, but it\\'s an important topic :)\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 08: Arrays                                     Duration:\t09 min. 26 sec.\n===================================================================================\nArrays are an important building block for any programming language. Learn all about Java arrays in this lesson, from creation to initialization to calling them. By the end of the lesson, you will have the winning lottery numbers.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 09: Loops                                      Duration:\t14 min. 29 sec.\n===================================================================================\nLoopy loopy loops! Learn about each of the four different types of loops in java: while, for, do while, and for each. Learn about when to use them and the strengths and weaknesses of each\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 10: Nested Loops and 2D Arrays,                Duration:\t13 min. 03 sec. \n===================================================================================\nGrids, matricies, two-dimensional arrays! Learn how to create them, how to use them, and how to loop over them with nested loops in this lesson.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 11: Object Oriented Programming,               Duration:\t15 min. 47 sec.\n===================================================================================\nThis is the first lesson in object oriented programming. Learn the difference between a class and an object. Learn how to create classes in Java, as well as how to instantiate their objects. Field variables, constructors, accessors, it\\'s all here!\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 12: Writing Functions in Classes,              Duration:\t14 min. 50 sec.\n===================================================================================\nThis time we continue on our OOP discussions and we learn to add methods to our classes. We write an example class and add some methods to it. We also learn the unorthodox practice of daisy-chaining.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 13: File and Text Input                        Duration:\t17 min. 28 sec.\n===================================================================================\nUse the Scanner class to read input, either from a file or from the user as command line input. Also, learn how to add Java to your (Windows) system path so you can access run your programs from a command line.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 14: Intro to Recursion                         Duration:\t19 min. 38 sec.\n===================================================================================\nRecursion is the process of calling a function within the body of itself. Learn how recursion works with two simple examples. Sorry for the loud keyboard!\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 15: Advanced Recursion                         Duration:\t21 min. 56 sec. \n===================================================================================\nLearn the thought process I use when writing a recursive algorithm. After mastering the technique in this video, you should be able to write any recursive algorithm. Tail recursion is also briefly covered.\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\nLesson 16: Writing to Files                           Duration:\t11 min. 08 sec. \n===================================================================================\nLearn another I/O technique in this short lesson. Create, overwrite, and append to files, and learn how to let go of your files once you\\'re done with them.\n\n\n\nSource From:    javavideotutes.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8fcc52d224a37444ff915fa8e5e3696bc6cbc2","amp;dn":"JAVA+video+tutorials+for+the+beginners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e8fcc52d224a37444ff915fa8e5e3696bc6cbc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,143,204,82,210,36,163,116,68,255,145,95,168,229,227,105,107,198,203,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
