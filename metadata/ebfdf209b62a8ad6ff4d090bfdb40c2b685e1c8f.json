THIS IS THE SOUNDTRACK, NOT GAME :)\n\nI couldn't be bothered writing up the details, but the files are all named and numbered correctly etc.\n\nComposed by Sascha Dikicyan &amp; Cris Velasko.\n\nIt's a pretty heavy orchestra, good for foreboding background music, could play whilst working/homeworking, or mute games that have terrible soundtracks and play over the top ;)\n\nFor this I'd give the soundtrack more out of ten than the game.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\nPS\nAny hints, help, questions, ideas for future torrents etc please let me know in comments :)\nIf it's great, then plz rate it up. Cheers all, hope it downloads fast for y'all :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebfdf209b62a8ad6ff4d090bfdb40c2b685e1c8f","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40K+Space+Marine+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebfdf209b62a8ad6ff4d090bfdb40c2b685e1c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,253,242,9,182,42,138,214,255,77,9,11,253,180,12,43,104,94,28,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
