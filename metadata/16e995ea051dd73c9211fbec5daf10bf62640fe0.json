They subsequently dropped out of their studies to further concentrate on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for Portnoy's replacement drummer. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.\n\nThis torrent contains the following\n\nDream Theater - A Change of Seasons.pdf\nDream Theater - Awake.pdf\nDream Theater - Awake (Single).pdf\nDream Theater - Falling Into Infinity.pdf\nDream Theater - Images &amp; Words.pdf\nDream Theater - Octavarium.pdf\nDream Theater - Scenes From A Memory.pdf\nDream Theater - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.pdf\nDream Theater - Systematic Chaos.pdf\nDream Theater - Train Of Thought.pdf\nDream Theater - When Dream And Day Unite.pdf\n\nplease seed after downloading\n\ncheck out my other uploads as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e995ea051dd73c9211fbec5daf10bf62640fe0","amp;dn":"dream+theater+-+sheet+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e995ea051dd73c9211fbec5daf10bf62640fe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,233,149,234,5,29,215,60,146,17,251,236,93,175,16,191,98,100,15,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
