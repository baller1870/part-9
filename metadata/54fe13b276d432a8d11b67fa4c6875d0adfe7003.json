The 16-bit ST was covered\nto an extent, although it was later spun off into it's own title \n(&quot;Atari ST User&quot;). After the magazine's demise, the Atari User name was\nobtained by Page 6 magazine (also available at RetroPDFs).\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\npublic torrent trackers . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the\nsource images. \n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to RetroPDFs\nfor their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
