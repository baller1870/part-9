My personal Recommendation, Alan Davis Drake's narration is just classy as the book.\n\nIt is not necessary to say much about this tailor; but, as it is the custom to have the character of each personage in a novel clearly defined, there is no help for it, so here is Petrovitch the tailor. At first he was called only Grigoriy, and was some gentleman's serf; he commenced calling himself Petrovitch from the time when he received his free papers, and further began to drink heavily on all holidays, at first on the great ones, and then on all church festivities without discrimination, wherever a cross stood in the calendar.\n\nNarrator - Alan Davis Drake\n\nBit Rate - 64Kbps\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
