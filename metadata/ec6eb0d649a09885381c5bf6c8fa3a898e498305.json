The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends. The tale plays with logic in ways that have given the story lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative course and structure have been enormously influential, especially in the fantasy genre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec6eb0d649a09885381c5bf6c8fa3a898e498305","amp;dn":"ALICE+IN+WONDERLAND+-+Lewis+Carroll+%28pdf%2C+epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec6eb0d649a09885381c5bf6c8fa3a898e498305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,110,176,214,73,160,152,133,56,28,91,246,200,250,58,137,142,73,131,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
