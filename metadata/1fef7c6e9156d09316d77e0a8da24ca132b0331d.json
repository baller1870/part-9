The work covers a wide range of algorithmic areas, and each algorithmic area is covered by a collection of entries.An encyclopedia entry is an in-depth mini-survey of an algorithmic problem and is written by an expert researcher. The entries for an algorithmic area are compiled by an area editor to survey the representative results in that area and can form the core materials of a course in the area. The Encyclopedia does not use the format of a conventional long survey for several reasons. A conventional survey takes a handful of individuals too much time to write and is diÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¬Ã†â€™cult to update. An encyclopedia entry contains the same kinds of information as in a conventional survey, but an encyclopedia entry is much shorter and is much easier for readers to absorb and for editors to update. Furthermore, an algorithmic area is surveyed by a collection of entries which together provide a considerableamount of up-to-date information about the area,while the writing and updating of the entries is distributed among multiple authors to speed up the work. This reference work will be updated on a regular basis and will evolve towards primarily an Internet-based medium to allow timely updates andfast search.
