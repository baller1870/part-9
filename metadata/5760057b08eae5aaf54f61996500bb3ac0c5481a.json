Wildlife the world over need to roam for breeding, foraging, and to carry out their traditional migrations-but they are often blocked by ranches, farms, roads, and other human-made obstacles. While national parks and preserves offer some protection to wildlife, even the magnificent Serengeti and Yellowstone parks are too small to sustain healthy populations over generations.\r\nBut now comes new hope for wildlife through an approach called &quot;connectivity conservation.&quot; Wild Ways reveals through stunning cinematography how some of the world's most beloved species-lions, bears, antelope and elephants-can be preserved by linking the world's wildlife refuges with tunnels, overpasses, and protected land corridors. From North America's Yellowstone to Yukon, to Southern Africa's elephant highways stretching across five nations, animals are on the move again in Wild Ways.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 965 MiB\r\nDuration : 53mn 22s\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 527 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate : 2 396 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 (30000/1001) fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English\r\n \nhttps://yuq.me/users/52/888/R7YscQMNyO.jpg \nhttps://yuq.me/users/52/888/HeUTC8wrvk.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5760057b08eae5aaf54f61996500bb3ac0c5481a","amp;dn":"PBS+NOVA+Wild+Ways+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5760057b08eae5aaf54f61996500bb3ac0c5481a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,96,5,123,8,234,229,170,245,79,97,153,101,0,187,58,192,197,72,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
