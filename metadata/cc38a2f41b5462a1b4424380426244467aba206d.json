The action sequences aren't bad, either.\n\nReview\nby Kozo: Jet Lis Hitman is a curious film. Its an action comedy about Fu (Jet), an ex-soldier who gets hired by a low-rent triad (Eric Tsang) to chase a100 million dollar hit: to kill the King of Assassins, who was responsible for the murder of a powerful Japanese crimelord. Thing is, everyone and their brother is after the reward, including the Japanese guys son, whos damn intent on getting that 100 million for himself.\nFu seems to have the ability to get the job done, but hes too damn nice, which is a perfect fit for Jet Li the actor. This is actually the best character Jet Li has played in a while, eschewing his humorless acting for a gentler personality. This film effectively dodges the previously inescapable Jet Li bullet: no personality. Eric Tsang and Jet Li make a good team, with Tsang edging Li in the acting department. However, Li isnt too bad, and we hear his real voice for the first time.\nGigi Leung shows up as Tsangs daughter, a budding lawyer who takes a small shine to Fu. As always, shes incredibly cute but she doesnt do all that much. Simon Yam is on board as the cop intent on catching all the hitmen entering HK. There are some good action sequences that are weighed down by a sometimes confusing and slow plot. But, this film has a definite HK charm that it deserves credit for. This isnt a thrill-a-minute exercise, but its quite worthwhile\n\n\n\nParents Guide: View content advisory for parents\nRuntime: 103 min\nCountry: Hong Kong\n\nCertification:\nPhilippines:PG-13 | Iceland:16 | Finland:K-15 | South Korea:15 | Australia:MA | Canada:13+ (Quebec) | Canada:18A | Germany:18 | Hong Kong:IIB | New Zealand:R16 | Singapore:NC-16 | Sweden:15 (video rating) | UK:18 | USA:R\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc38a2f41b5462a1b4424380426244467aba206d","amp;dn":"Jet+Li+-+Hitman+%5BDvDRip%5D+ENG+DUB+%5BDivX%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc38a2f41b5462a1b4424380426244467aba206d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,56,162,244,27,84,98,161,180,66,67,128,66,98,68,70,122,186,32,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
