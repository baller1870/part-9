That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 800-850gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n================================\n\n    Hi everybody!!!! or at least the few, the elite, the bored who are reading this. Special thanks go all those kind enough to tell me you actually enjoy my ramblings. It's a outlet for my latent desire to write. It keeps me off the streets at night. Technically my wife does that - But can't a guy have a little fun? Maybe even a hall pass once and awhile? Why so possessive Geesh! Doesn't she know us males are driven by evolution to spread the &quot;joy&quot;? Does she expect me to fight millions of years of selective pressure? I can't take the pressure! I can't take the rolling pin to the head again either. There's a selective pressure for you! She selects my head to get a sudden increase in pressure!\n\n      Now on another subject, Before the JLA DC first had the Justice Society back in the 1940's. Like most superheroes these guys did not survive the Golden Age of comics. Of course as you know they reappeared later on, although not quite as they were. Before that happened DC re-invented them as the Justice League, made up initially of mainly the new Silver Age versions of the Justice Society members. Most of the heroes had the same names and the same powers, but of course their are  obvious exceptions\n\n       But let's over think this. Then let's over think that some more. The heroes kept the same name even when, as with The Atom, they had nothing else in common withe the 1940s name-alike. But the team changed names. Not Society now, but League.  Why this change? Surely is is not random. Oh no, It couldn't be just stylistic variation. And they could never have foreseen the revival of the old team, which could have made for an awkward naming situation without the change, as indeed it did for many of the heroes. Only a few foresighted individuals saw the advantage of having different names than their alternate earth counterparts that they did not know existed. Powergirl stands out. Yes Powergirl would stand out more and more as time went on. Man you just gotta love the way she stands out (wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more!) \n       But back to that name business. So much less interesting than Powergirl's outstanding features. Ahem. Could it be that in the 1940s people were more social and had closer relationships with their neighbors in those front porch days, with fewer in home entertainment options. A society is a group of interacting individuals. Now in the air conditioned, stay in doors, color TV watching 60s did people only unite for mutual gain with less feeling, a mere league, rather than a society?\n\tWould you believe that a load of utter nonsense? Would you believe I've seen many a scholarly statement with no more foundation than that? Argue among yourselves please. I'm moving on.\n\n\tI want to point out once agin that I'm very strict about the alphabetizing of the DC comics. I do tend to group some of the non-dc stuff in with the comics they relate two, as many people might not know they were included and not know to look for them by name. I also include a few small things in both their strict placement and with comics they go with thematically.\n\tI use the names printed inside the comics, rather than the on the cover, as they are more consistent and unambiguous titles than what appear's on the cover.\nBut there remains a problem of where the reader expects to find a comic, since people are shockingly loose in common speech. One of the more obvious examples is that many a Justice League comic is referred to as &quot;JLA&quot; and sometimes vice versa.  I'm just shocked!\n\n        Go look in part 25 for JLA. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it's Not my FAULT, people! And I'm not changing because of it. I have made my god-like decisions about how to assemble these torrents and there is no appeal. I'm the god-damned Joshua13!. Really I do think sometimes he has damned me to hell in this life, if not the next. or at least &quot;darned me to heck&quot;. BTW I don't mean the torrents have no appeal. Though they certainly have no peels, which might be confused as certain people when speaking english tend to insert &quot;A&quot;s, and Uh's willy nilly. &quot;the fruit-uh has-ah peel&quot;  But where was I? Oh yes here I am with my computer, my trusty faithful, only friend, who's always there for me. So I'm right here. saying you have no appeal (and I've never even met you). I know what kind of person is still reading this. Unless I am mistaken,  you look nothing at all like Powergirl and lack her most outstanding characteristics except in an unimportant and functionless way. If I'm mistaken about that, then PM me or put your contact info in the comments. Maybe we can get together. I'm much wittier and  more charming in person. And I might be rich. And just thinks of the &quot;contact fame&quot; on this site.\n \n       Money can't buy happiness, friendship or love but sometimes some pretty good stuff from some of the most outstanding people can be bought. Or at least rented.\n\n\tOr as someone said &quot;I've been poor and I've been rich. Rich is better&quot;\n=================================\n\nToday's offering: DC's Justice League!\n\nJustice League is the next torrent.
