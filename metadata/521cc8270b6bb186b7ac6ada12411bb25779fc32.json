A sequel to Oldfield's 1973 Tubular Bells and his 1992 Tubular Bells II albums, it was released on the 25th anniversary of the first Tubular Bells album.\nAt the time of creating Tubular Bells III Oldfield had been living in Ibiza, and thus certain elements of the album reflect the moods of the island.\nIt features vocalists in the following songs; &quot;Man in the Rain&quot; features Cara Dillon (credited as Cara from Polar Star) with additional vocals by Heather Burnett. &quot;The Inner Child&quot; features Rosa CedrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n (Luar Na Lubre). &quot;The Source of Secrets&quot;, &quot;Jewel in the Crown&quot; and &quot;Secrets&quot; feature Amar and &quot;Far Above the Clouds&quot; features Clodagh Simonds and Francesca Robertson. Also, Mike Oldfield can be heard saying 'Out Demon' on &quot;Outcast&quot;.\nTubular Bells III is the least successful of the three main Tubular Bells albums, only attaining #4 on the UK chart, unlike its two chart topping predecessors. Critical reaction was mixed, with many accusing Oldfield of pushing the Tubular Bells series too far. The very distinct similarity of &quot;Man in the Rain&quot; to the hit &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; was sometimes interpreted as Oldfield trying retread old ground. Some fans thought that the introduction of dance-orientated tracks was not staying faithful to the Tubular Bells name.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
