One listen to Long Slow Dance shows that any fears of that nature are unfounded, and the band has turned in another neo-psych gem. Just as on the previous album Play It Strange, the Fresh &amp; Onlys take a step further away from their murky, lo-fi beginnings, this time sounding slicker, and also more powerful, than ever; as at times, guitars envelop the listener, drums ring out like canon blasts, and Tim Cohen's vocals, while still happily weird, are up front in the mix. Many bands have tried this tactic and failed, the Fresh &amp; Onlys make it work for them by keeping enough of the atmospheric swirl of reverb lurking in the mix, making sure that the guitar sound varies from track to track, and above all, writing killer songs. Even though Long Slow Dance sounds one coat of studio gloss away from a Mitch Easter production, the strength of the songs and performance mean the band is still working as well as ever, maybe even better, and Long Slow Dance stands as their most satisfying album to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f41185553b586772f1d9073450933faab95feea","amp;dn":"The+Fresh+and+Onlys+-+Long+Slow+Dance+%282012%29+%5BMP3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f41185553b586772f1d9073450933faab95feea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,65,24,85,83,181,134,119,47,29,144,115,69,9,51,250,171,149,254,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
