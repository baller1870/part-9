Please comment.\n\n\n\nXara Xtreme Pro 5\n\nAn enhanced version of Xtreme with the extra features that Pro designers need including PDF/X, PANTONEÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and color separations, multi-core processor support for extra speed, enhanced import/export filters, enhanced Object Gallery and photo panorama tool and more\n\n\nXara Xtreme Pro offers various design possibilities in one compact program. While novices should be wary of its complexity, Web designers, animators and illustrators will find something to like.\n\nThe program's interface is a complex spread of tiny, unfamiliar icons. Fortunately, there are several tutorial texts and even a few videos to better familiarize users with its many features. The overwhelming impression we got from its tools was that Xara Xtreme is not for beginners. While it takes great pains to teach users about its various elements, there's no hand-holding. It takes a lot of effort and thought to produce professional-looking designs. That said, Xara Xtreme offers just about every tool imaginable for creating a Web page from scratch and posting it online. The animation options are a little less inviting since its commands aren't as extensive, but it still offers several tools and framing options. The drawing option feels like Microsoft Paint; anyone could use it. The program comes with a bevy of special features, though our favorite was its Web design templates, which make the complicated process of creating attractive Web sites a little smoother for inexperienced designers. Overall, Xara Xtreme is a great choice for those who need a comprehensive design package. Those who need things spelled out for them should find a program more suited to beginners.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n* MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® XP/Vista/7 (32 &amp; 64 Bit)\n* 256MB of RAM\n* 150MB of available hard-disk space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a758e0718bb72ded53a36f690860d528bcd83ef5","amp;dn":"Xara+Xtreme+5+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a758e0718bb72ded53a36f690860d528bcd83ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,88,224,113,139,183,45,237,83,163,111,105,8,96,213,40,188,216,62,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
