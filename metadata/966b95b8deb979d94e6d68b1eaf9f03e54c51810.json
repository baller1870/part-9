A very hot title, very creative and innovative game, which, copyright bitches, hunt like there is no tomorrow! Because it has been bought and DESTROYED by E.A., everyone's favorite, top, NO1 worst company, ever!\n\nPLANTS VS ZOMBIES GOTY RETAIL, it is! The very best version of this game. You install and play, it has no DRM whatsoever, no shitty client-hound, account locks, always on crap! The last version of this game, before PoPcap was purchased and thrown to minus infinite, by the shitty EA policies and demands! Imagine that the sequel, is an Android and IOs only, FREEMIUM, microtransactions ridden, pay to win, piece of sh*t! E.A. abysmal destruction at its finest!\n\nAlso, that faqturd of a company, used to giveaway this game for free in Origin, so they could lure lightweight BRAINZ into their crappy client and services. So, nothing wrong with me giving it away here! Take it, seed it, play it and don't forget to eat your BRAINZ! out. So long!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:966b95b8deb979d94e6d68b1eaf9f03e54c51810","amp;dn":"Plants+VS+Zombies+GOTY%3A+Retail+Iso+Image","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"966b95b8deb979d94e6d68b1eaf9f03e54c51810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,107,149,184,222,185,121,217,78,109,104,177,234,249,240,62,84,197,24,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
