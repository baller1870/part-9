Ten years later, in a battle in northern Greece, Villehardouin was defeated and captured by the Byzantine Emperor. The terms for his release included giving Mistra to the Byzantine Greeks. Under their rule, the city flourished and developed into a centre of learning and the arts and was a focal point for the cultural development of Europe. \n\nSir Steven Runciman, one of the most distinguished historians of the Byzantine period, travelled to Mistra on numerous occasions and became enchanted with the place.\n\n\nLost City of Byzantium -  tells the story of this once-great city - its rise and fall and its place in the history of the Peloponnese and the Byzantine empire.\n\nTitle: Lost Capital of Byzantium: The History of Mistra and the Peloponnese\nAuthor: Steven Runciman\nPublisher: TPP\nYear: 2009\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
