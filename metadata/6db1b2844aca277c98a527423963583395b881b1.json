While Funkadelic pursued band-format psychedelic rock, Parliament engaged in a funk free-for-all, blending influences from the godfathers (James Brown and Sly Stone) with freaky costumes and themes inspired by '60s acid culture and science fiction. From its 1970 inception until Clinton's dissolving of Parliament in 1980, the band hit the R&amp;B Top Ten several times but truly excelled in two other areas: large-selling, effective album statements and the most dazzling, extravagant live show in the business. In an era when Philly soul continued the slick sounds of establishment-approved R&amp;B, Parliament scared off more white listeners than it courted. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up)\n02.Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)\n03.Flash Light\n04.Dr. Funkenstein\n05.Up For The Down Stroke\n06.Chocolate City\n07.Bop Gun (Endangered Species)\n08.Testify ('74 Version)\n09.Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)\n10.Mothership Connection (Star Child)\n11.Agony Of Defeet\n\nCheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db1b2844aca277c98a527423963583395b881b1","amp;dn":"Parliament+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282000%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db1b2844aca277c98a527423963583395b881b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,177,178,132,74,202,39,124,152,165,39,66,57,99,88,51,149,184,129,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
