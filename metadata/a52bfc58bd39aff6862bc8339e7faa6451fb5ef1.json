NTSC (America) format. This file is not compressed. If you would like to compress it, look up PSP Compressor on CNET (download.com) and you will find a free program that compresses it into a .CSO format. \n\nTo play this, you need a modded PSP. If you don't have mod, this will NOT work.\n\nTo install onto Memory Stick, connect your PSP to your PC, enable USB mode, and copy this file into a folder called &quot;ISO&quot; (no quotation marks) in the root of your card.
