Many will only be familiar with the hit &quot;Happy Talk&quot;, which is not the best track on this album. The tunes are all strong, and though generally lighthearted and fun there is the odd serious subject and several different musical styles thrown in to add variety. And it works -- Women And Captains First is an enjoyable listen throughout. \n\nNew Musik fans are sure to love this as Tony Mansfield contributes much of his considerable talents, not just with his distinctive production. \n\n\n01   Wot    \n02   A Nice Cup Of Tea    \n03   Brenda (Part 1 &amp; 2)    \n04   Yanks With Guns    \n05   Happy Talk    \n06   Martha The Mouth    \n07   Nobody's Sweetheart    \n08   (What D'Ya Give) The Man Who's Gotten Everything    \n09   Who Is Melody Lee, Sid?    \n10   Gimme A Uniform    \n11   Croydon\n12   Wot (12'' Mix)   \n13   Strawberry Dross","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4723dad49456dee7504a608adc3dd31f1bb4896","amp;dn":"Captain+Sensible+-+Women+And+Captains+First+%5B1982%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4723dad49456dee7504a608adc3dd31f1bb4896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,114,61,173,73,69,109,238,117,4,166,8,173,195,221,49,241,187,72,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
