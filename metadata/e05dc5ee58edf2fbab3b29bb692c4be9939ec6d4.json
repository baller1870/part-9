The original\n&quot;N-Force&quot; magazine covered all Nintendo consoles of the era, before\nsplitting into two magazines in July 93. The &quot;new&quot; N-Force focussed\nsolely on the NES/Famicom, whilst SNES Force covered the SNES / Super\nFamicom. The NES-only N-Force lasted just two issues, whilst SNES Force\nmanaged into double figures before disappearing when Europress Impact\nwas closed down.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\npublic torrent trackers . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the\nsource images.\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more\ninformation.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to\nRetroPDFs for their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
