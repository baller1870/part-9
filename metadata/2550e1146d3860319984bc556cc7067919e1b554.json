Despite this resurgence, no single book has been published that takes an interdisciplinary approach in addressing the full scope of mineral exploration-from mining and extraction to economic evaluation, policies, sustainability, and environmental impacts. Mineral Exploration: Principles and Applications accomplishes this by presenting each topic with theoretical approaches first followed by specific applications that can be immediately implemented in the field.\n\n-    Presents 16 case studies that allow readers to quickly apply exploration concepts to real-life scenarios in the field\n-    Includes more than 200 illustrations and full-color photographs that aid the reader in retaining key procedures and applications\n-    Each chapter is structured so that its topic is discussed theoretically first followed by specific applications\n-    Combines both theory and application in a multidisciplinary reference that thoroughly addresses the full scope of mineral exploration\n-    Authored by an instructor with more than 30 years of experience in the field and a decade as a consultant for commercial mining companies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2550e1146d3860319984bc556cc7067919e1b554","amp;dn":"Mineral+Exploration+-+Principles+and+Applications+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2550e1146d3860319984bc556cc7067919e1b554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,80,225,20,109,56,96,49,153,132,188,85,108,199,6,121,25,225,181,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
