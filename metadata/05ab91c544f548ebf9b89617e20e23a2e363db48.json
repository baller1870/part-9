This book starts right from the beginning and explains everything in simple English. There are hints throughout to make learning easy and you can learn at your own pace with plenty of practice of each new point.\n\nIt is a friendly introduction to the language which will help you to understand and speak Italian sufficiently well to function effectively in basic everyday situations. The course will also offer you an insight into Italian culture.\nNew language is introduced through short dialogues and texts which are also on the accompanying recording and there are plenty of exercises to practise each new point as it is introduced.\n\nTwo accompanying cassettes or CDs are available separately or in a pack with the book.\n\nVittoria Bowles, the author, has taught Italian for 27 years, including 18 years at the University of Brighton.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ab91c544f548ebf9b89617e20e23a2e363db48","amp;dn":"Teach+Yourself+Beginner%5C%27s+Italian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ab91c544f548ebf9b89617e20e23a2e363db48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,171,145,197,68,245,72,235,249,184,150,23,226,14,35,162,227,99,219,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
