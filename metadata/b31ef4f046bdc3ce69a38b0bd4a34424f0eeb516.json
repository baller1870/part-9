Cowgill\n\n\nPlot must be as much about the emotions of the characters as it is about the events of the story. ThatÃ‚â€™s the message of The Art of Plotting, which teaches screenwriters how to integrate plot, characterization, and exposition to make stories compelling. Using examples from recent and classic movies, author Linda J. Cowgill demonstrates how the plot springs naturally from the charactersÃ‚â€”and how that technique makes audiences connect with the story on a more intimate level. Easy exercises reveal common plot problems and help writers overcome them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31ef4f046bdc3ce69a38b0bd4a34424f0eeb516","amp;dn":"+The+Art+of+Plotting+-+Linda+J.+Cowgill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31ef4f046bdc3ce69a38b0bd4a34424f0eeb516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,30,244,240,70,189,195,206,105,163,139,11,212,163,68,36,240,238,181,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
