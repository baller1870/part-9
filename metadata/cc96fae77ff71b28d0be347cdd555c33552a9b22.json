The number of \nuseful object-tracking methods is exploding. But how are they related? How do \nthey help track everything from aircraft, missiles and extra-terrestrial \nobjects to people and lymphocyte cells? How can they be adapted to novel \napplications? Fundamentals of Object Tracking tells you how. Starting with \nthe generic object-tracking problem, it outlines the generic Bayesian solution. \nIt then shows systematically how to formulate the major tracking problems - \nmaneuvering, multiobject, clutter, out-of-sequence sensors - within this \nBayesian framework and how to derive the standard tracking solutions. This \nstructured approach makes very complex object-tracking algorithms accessible \nto the growing number of users working on real-world tracking problems and \nsupports them in designing their own tracking filters under their unique \napplication constraints. The book concludes with a chapter on issues critical \nto successful implementation of tracking algorithms, such as track \ninitialization and merging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc96fae77ff71b28d0be347cdd555c33552a9b22","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+Fundamentals+Of+Object+Tracking+2011+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc96fae77ff71b28d0be347cdd555c33552a9b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,150,250,231,127,247,27,40,208,190,52,124,221,85,92,51,85,42,155,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
