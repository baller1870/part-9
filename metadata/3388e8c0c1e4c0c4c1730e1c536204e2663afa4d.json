Fraas, Larry D. Partain, &quot;Solar Cells and Their Applications&quot;\nWiley | 2010 | ISBN: 0470446331 | 648 pages | PDF \n\nSince the first publication of this important volume over a decade ago, dramatic changes have taken place with the solar market growing almost 100-fold and the U.S. moving from first to fourth place in the world market as analyzed in this Second Edition. Three bold new opportunities are identified for any countries wanting to improve market position. The first is combining pin solar cells with 3X concentration to achieve economic competitiveness near term. The second is charging battery-powered cars with solar cellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“generated electricity from arrays in surrounding areasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including the car owners' homesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while simultaneously reducing their home electricity bills by over ninety percent. The third is formation of economic &quot;unions&quot; of sufficient combined economic size to be major competitors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3388e8c0c1e4c0c4c1730e1c536204e2663afa4d","amp;dn":"Solar+Cells+and+Their+Applications+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3388e8c0c1e4c0c4c1730e1c536204e2663afa4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,136,232,192,193,228,192,196,193,115,14,28,83,98,4,226,102,58,250,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
