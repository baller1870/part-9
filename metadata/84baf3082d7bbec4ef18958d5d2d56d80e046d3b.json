Nestling between Dorland Bray&amp;#039;s punchy drumming, Stephan Philip&amp;#039;s nifty guitar hooks, and Helen Carter&amp;#039;s wonderful bass work lies one of Australia&amp;#039;s finest if not the world&amp;#039;s most powerful female voices ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Deborah Conway. Domestic is indeed just that in sound and lyric. &quot;Theme From Uncle Jim&quot; sounds a little tawdry now but it&amp;#039;s followed by some of the best examples of Aussie rock from that period; &quot;After the Volcano&quot; and &quot;Idiot Grin&quot; both exude a fresh jangly guitar sound married to rock prowess. The result resides somewhere between the Church and INXS. Their biggest hit, &quot;Man Overboard,&quot; features the words &quot;penis envy,&quot; which got it banned in the U.K. More startling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it isn&amp;#039;t even the best track. Further wonderment and for those seeking an altogether Aussie sound should hear &quot;New Tabboos&quot; and &quot;1000 Mouths&quot;; great for air drumming also. \n \n\nTracks \n   \n   \n \n       1   Theme From Jungle Jim      \n       2   After the Volcano      \n       3   Idiot Grin      \n       4   Cuttlefish Beach      \n       5   Warnings Moving Clockwise      \n       6   Black Crocodiles      \n       7   Man Overboard      \n       8   Big Accident      \n       9   Racing to Zero      \n       10   New Taboos      \n       11   1000 Mouths      \n  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84baf3082d7bbec4ef18958d5d2d56d80e046d3b","amp;dn":"Do-Re-Mi+-+Domestic+Harmony+%281987%29+-+Deborah+Conway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84baf3082d7bbec4ef18958d5d2d56d80e046d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,186,243,8,45,123,190,196,239,24,149,141,93,45,86,216,14,4,109,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
