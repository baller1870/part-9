He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface. Drawn to what he has called the &quot;four-squareness of the utterance&quot; in ?Beowulf? and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.\n\n---\n\nInformation:\nFormat: ePub (2.0)\nFile Size: 792 KB (original) 519 KB (this edition)\nPrint Length: 256 pages\nLanguage: English/Old English\nASIN: B001ULOPUE\nISBN: 978-0-393-06975-4 (ePub edition)\nISBN: 0-393-32097-9 (printed edition)\n\n---\n\nComment:\nYes, this is the bilingual edition. People seems to complain it isn't where it is for sale. Either they really are retards, or they have updated the file that they distribute (more likely, probably). To no avail, for most people, I need to add.\nThe people making this really don't know how to implement an UTF-8 font into an ePub file. It probably worked fine for them, reading it at their desktop computers (where the specified font is installed). But for (more than) 9 out of 10 people reading it on their phones etc., it would not. I.e. The Old-English translation would have loads and loads non non-renderable glyphs in it.\n\nBut fear not, [DerHammer] have made a proper edition for you. That's why it isn't so much smaller than the original this time. I had to embed a complete fontset (still subset, naturally) into this one. Otherwise it would have been half of the current size (and yes, I repeat myself &quot;While still looking better...).\n\nSo Geats, share and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e010f140b6a28a5041805056508ec578cdadba82","amp;dn":"Beowulf+%28Bilingual+Edition%29+-+Seamus+Heaney+%5BDerHammer%5D.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e010f140b6a28a5041805056508ec578cdadba82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,16,241,64,182,162,138,80,65,128,80,86,80,142,197,120,205,173,186,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
