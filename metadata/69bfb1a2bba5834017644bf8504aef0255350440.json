As the grandson of Hank Williams and the son of Hank Jr., he was country music royalty before he ever sang a note. But he didn't immediately follow his forebears musically, choosing instead to bang around the Southeast, playing drums in punk and hardcore combos and smoking prodigious amounts of weed. It was the outlaw spirit of his lineage, alive and unwell and floating in the bong water. By 1996, steep child support payments and his thirst for Mother Nature had forced Hank III onto to the straight and narrow, and he signed a contract with Music City giant Curb. The label issued Three Hanks: Men with Broken Hearts, which brought the voices of all three generations of Williams men together via the ghastly miracles of modern technology. It was about as far from what Hank III wanted as he could get and signaled the beginning of his stormy relationship with Curb. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\nLabel:\t\t\tCurb\t\t\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Hillbilly Joker\n02.I'm Drunk Again\n03.Life Of Sin\n04.10 Feet Down\n05.Pistol Packin'\n06.Tennessee Driver\n07.M.F.J.\n08.Now He's Dead\n09.Drink It, Drug It\n10.Hellbilly\n\n\n\n\n              \n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69bfb1a2bba5834017644bf8504aef0255350440","amp;dn":"Hank+Williams+III+-+Hillbilly+Joker+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69bfb1a2bba5834017644bf8504aef0255350440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,191,177,162,187,165,131,64,23,100,75,248,80,74,239,2,85,53,4,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
