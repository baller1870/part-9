I have enjoyed it immensely. The music is exhilirating and has introduced an eastern dimension to the classical music of Mozart making the experience of listening to it outstanding.\n\n\nIt does not only bring east and west together but actually manages to blend them beautifully on different occasions. The eastern instruments used like the ney, kawala and the rababa have managed to create Mozart's perfect orchestra and have brought a fascinating sense of the mystical east to the music.\n\n\nThe vocals and singers have also added a lot of inspiration to the music.\n\n\nThis is something you must listen too!\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63617c7700dc04d185ec847ffd347e68c8b2f1ea","amp;dn":"Mozart+in+Egypt+-+Parts+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63617c7700dc04d185ec847ffd347e68c8b2f1ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,97,124,119,0,220,4,209,133,236,132,127,253,52,126,104,200,178,241,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
