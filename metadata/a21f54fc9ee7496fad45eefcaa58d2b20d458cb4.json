Frame maker Jonathan (Bruno Ganz) believes he is dying from a blood disease. Jonathan's American friend, displaced cowboy Ripley (Dennis Hopper), decides to use his illness to his advantage. Ripley introduces him to a gangster who proposes to the dying man that he should become a professional mob assassin, assuring a large legacy for his wife and children. Since he is facing death anyway, what has he to lose? Ripley had originally intended to allow Jonathan to do the dirty work that he didn't feel like doing, but has second thoughts when he becomes friends with the doomed man.\n\nCast:\t\nDennis Hopper...Tom Ripley\nBruno Ganz...Jonathan Zimmermann\nLisa Kreuzer...Marianne Zimmermann\nGÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rard Blain...Raoul Minot\nNicholas Ray...Derwatt\nSamuel Fuller...The American Mobster\nPeter Lilienthal...Marcangelo\nDaniel Schmid...Ingraham\nJean Eustache...Friendly Man\nRudolf SchÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ndler...Gantner\nSandy Whitelaw...Doctor in Paris\nLou Castel...Rodolphe\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_078.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_078.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_081.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_081.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_083.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i426.photobucket.com/albums/pp342/koma801/PDVD_083.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21f54fc9ee7496fad45eefcaa58d2b20d458cb4","amp;dn":"Der+Amerikanische+Freund+-+Wim+Wenders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21f54fc9ee7496fad45eefcaa58d2b20d458cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,31,84,252,158,231,73,111,173,69,238,252,170,88,210,178,13,69,140,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
