These luminous, entertaining essays travel both the vastness of the cosmos and the intimacy of the human mind, posing such fascinating questions as how did the universe originate and how will it end, and how can we meld science and compassion to meet the challenges of the coming century? Here, too, is a rare, private glimpse of Sagan's thoughts about love, death, and God as he struggled with fatal disease. Ever forward-looking and vibrant with the sparkle of his unquenchable curiosity, Billions &amp; Billions is a testament to one of the great scientific minds of our day.\n\nContact (TXT)\n-------------\nIt is December 1999, the dawn of the millennium, and a team of international scientists is poised for the most fantastic adventure in human history. After years of scanning the galaxy for signs of somebody or something else, this team believes they've found a message from an intelligent source--and they travel deep into space to meet it. Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan injects Contact, his prophetic adventure story, with scientific details that make it utterly believable. It is a Cold War era novel that parlays the nuclear paranoia of the time into exquisitely wrought tension among the various countries involved. Sagan meditates on science, religion, and government--the elements that define society--and looks to their impact on and role in the future. His ability to pack an exciting read with such rich content is an unusual talent that makes Contact a modern sci-fi classic.\n\nCosmos (PDF)\n------------\nCosmos was the first science TV blockbuster, and Carl Sagan was its (human) star. By the time of Sagan's death in 1996, the series had been seen by half a billion people; Sagan was perhaps the best-known scientist on the planet.\n\nThe Demon-Haunted World (PDF)\n-----------------------------\nHow can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.\n\n\nThe Dragons of Eden (PDF)\n-------------------------\nThe Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence is a Pulitzer prize[1] winning 1977 book by Carl Sagan. In it, he combines the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science to give a well balanced perspective of how human intelligence evolved.\n\n\nPale Blue Dot (DOC)\n-------------------\nIn a tour of our solar system, galaxy and beyond, Cornell astronomer Sagan meshes a history of astronomical discovery, a cogent brief for space exploration and an overview of life-from its origins in the oceans to humanity's first emergence to a projected future where humans &quot;terraform&quot; and settle other planets, Earth having long been swallowed by the sun. Maintaining that such relocation is inevitable, the author further argues that planetary science is of practical utility, fostering an interdisciplinary approach to looming environmental catastrophes such as &quot;nuclear winter&quot; (lethal cooling of Earth after a nuclear war, a widely accepted prediction first calculated by Sagan in 1982). His exploration of our place in the universe is illustrated with photographs, relief maps and paintings, including high-resolution images made by Voyager 1 and 2, as well as photos taken by the Galileo spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope and satellites orbiting Earth, which show our planet as a pale blue dot. A worthy sequel to Sagan's Cosmos.\n\nThe Varieties Of Scientific Experience (LIT)\n--------------------------------------------\nIn his charmingly down-to-earth voice, the late astronomer Carl Sagan discusses the relationship between religion and science and describes his own personal search to understand the nature of the sacred in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\nThe Cosmic Connection (PDF)\n---------------------------\nIn 1973, Carl Sagan published The Cosmic Connection, a daring view of the universe, which rapidly became a classic work of popular science and inspired a generation of scientists and enthusiasts. This seminal work is reproduced here for a whole new generation to enjoy. In SaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s typically lucid, lyrical style, he discusses many topics from astrophysics and solar system science, to colonization of other worlds, terraforming and the search for extraterrestrials. Sagan conveys his own excitement and wonder, and relates the revelations of astronomy to the most profound human problems and concerns: issues that are just as valid today as they were 30 years ago. New to this edition are Freeman DysonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s comments on SaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision and the importance of the work, Ann DruyanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assessment of SaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cultural significance as a champion of science, and David MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s discussion of the advances made since 1973 and what became of SaganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s predictions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994b919aee58d630b53a843a48288f74440a885d","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan+E-book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994b919aee58d630b53a843a48288f74440a885d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,75,145,154,238,88,214,48,181,58,132,58,72,40,143,116,68,10,136,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
