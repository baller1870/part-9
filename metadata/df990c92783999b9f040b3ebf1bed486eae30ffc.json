If you're not familiar with Zucchero's work, you'll be pleasantly surprised by his blues/funk/rock style. If you're just starting your Zucchero collection, stray away from the abums with songs that he's either translated or sung originally in English. For some reason, his raspy style of belting out tunes works best in Italian.&quot;\n\n&quot;This a terrific upbeat fun album and I don't understand a word of Italian. My 2 and 5 year olds love to dance to this album as much as my wife and I do. It's really got something special.&quot;\n\n&quot;The truth is, I understand very little Italian... but Zucchero transcends language. His ballads, like Cosi Celeste (So Heavenly) are--well, heavenly--that was our wedding song, as a matter of fact. When he gets revved up, songs like Voodoo and Datemi Una Pompa have enough energy to excite bluesy rock fans of any type. He's the Italian Springsteen, and for good reason. (As a side note, don't buy the English version of his albums--he transliterates and really doesn't achieve the same level of intensity as he does singing in Italian or Spanish...)&quot;\n\n&quot;Spirito di Vino was my introduction to Zucchero when I saw him live in L.A. and had the pleasure of meeting with him. While I prefer the Italian CD, the English CD has its merits, including some cuts absent here, and vice versa (Voodoo is absent from the American CD). Anyone wanting to explore the blues-rock world of &quot;Zook&quot; should start here to discover &quot;Joe Cocker di Italia.&quot;\n\nIn case these reviews have not convinced you yet: Breezin likes it a lot as well! :)  \n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
