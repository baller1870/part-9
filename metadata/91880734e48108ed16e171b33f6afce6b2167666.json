I gotta say, vol. 66 is the darkest of all in this installments. You know by now that I have a penchant for diversity when doing these mixes, but I gotta say on vol. 66 the focus is almost entirely on goth wave, dark wave and post-punk music. These artists and bands largely remained in obscurity, nonetheless produced some of the finest music of the 80's. I think you'd be enthralled with this one.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1 Bushido - A Question Of Identity (From Deliverance mini LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1985)\n\n2 Gentlemen In War - White Windows (From  White Windows LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1989)\n\n3 Corps Diplomatique - Generations (From This Can't Be Heaven LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1987)\n\n4 Calendar Crowd - Questions Answers (From Listen In To The Heart Single Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1985)\n\n5 Intimate Obsessions - Assassin (From Assassin EP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1985)\n\n6 Demars - Even For All Those Years (From 1983 EP Stories From Between The Walls)\n\n7 Eleven Pond - Turn To Silence (From Assemblage LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1987)\n\n8 They Fade In Silence - Won't Let Know (From Traveller - What Have You Seen LP 1987)\n\n9 End Of Data - If I'm Not A Killer (From Sahrah LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1984)\n\n10 Remain In Silence - Roses On My Dying Bed (From This Is The Place Where Resistance Got Lost LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1987)\n\n11 Quite Simple - Unknown Strangers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (From 1989 LP,  Unknown Strangers)\n\n12 Big Self - Don't Turn Around (From 1985 LP Stateless)\n\n13 Lung Overcoat Ã¢â‚¬â€œ When Dreams Drag On (From 1986 EP Climbing Up The Hill)\n\n14 Zero Le Creche Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Beyond Westworld (1985 7'' Single)\n\n15 DADA Ã¢â‚¬â€œ As The Sun Races By (From 1988 EP Right Man Tell Lies)\n\n16 Idle Lovell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Only (From 1984 LP  Surge Et Illuminare)\n\n17 Mary Goes Round Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mary Sleeps Alone (From 1989 LP Sunset)\n\n18 Wire Train Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Like (From 1984 LP In A Chamber)\n\n19 Dorian Grae Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Talking With Grace (From 1987 Maxi Single Dorian Grae)\n\n20 Ego Loop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pathless Nothing (From 1988 LP Nothingness)\n\n21 Necropolis Of Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Done And Gone (From 1984 mini LP The Hope)\n\n22 The N.U.E Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Broken Window (From 1982 Mini LP Two Gether)\n\n\n23 Deafear - Fear Of Tears (From Stairs Mini-LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1983)\n\n24 Jung Analysts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Entrails (From 1987 VA LP Ã¢â‚¬â€œ For Your Ears Only)\n\n25 Lowlife Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eternity Road (From 1987 12'' Single -  Eternity Road)\n\n26 In Search Of Beauty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Love Is Colder Than Dead (From The Arise Mini-LP, Released Date Unknown)\n\n27 Calculated X Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dream Affair (From 1982 Single Four Windows\n\n28 Aus Decline Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fluxion (From 2014 re-issuse LP, Originally recorded in 1982)\n\n29 Day After Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ticking Away (From 1983 Mini-LP, Recourse)\n\n30 Dark White Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Article of Life (From 1985 Mini-LP, The Grey Area)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91880734e48108ed16e171b33f6afce6b2167666","amp;dn":"Rare+Hits+of+The+80%27s+Vol.+66","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91880734e48108ed16e171b33f6afce6b2167666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,136,7,52,228,129,8,237,22,225,113,179,63,106,252,230,178,22,118,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
