Cover-Up &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111021/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111021/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWith Kyle MacLachlan (Twin Peaks)\nMartin Sheen (West Wing)\nJohn M. Jackson (Commander from JAG)\nPeter MacNicol (Dr. Fleinhardt from Numb3rs)\n\nThis is a new quality rip from a brand-new DVD. I bought it because I thought the quality was too bad for the rip I found on the net and uploaded earlier. I was surprised to see the interest in this film, which I thought everyone knew. I saw it the first time from a satellite film channel in 1996, and it has been one of my favourites ever since.\n\nPlot: A major who actually witnessed the (in)famous UFO landing in Roswell in 1947, looks back on what really happened. He had a hard time trying to convince his superiors that he did not find just a weather balloon. Adapted from real-life events portrayed in the book 'UFO Crash at Roswell' by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt. With scenes from the original crash site and the well-known autopsy of the aliens.\n\nPlease note: This was originally a made-for-TV movie, and the brand-new DVD is not perfect. It sometimes has a few thin horizontal black lines that could not be removed in the ripping process.\n\nOriginal letterbox format.\nXviD 2-pass 624x464, good stereo sound AC3.\n\nBurn tested, runs well in both my standalone DivX players.\n\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 698 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nOveral bit rate                  : 1071 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nMuxing mode                      : Packet Bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate                         : 933 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 464 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.134\nStream size                      : 609 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 83.5 MiB\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97 \nEncoding settings                : CBR\n\nSource: NTSC IVTC 4.11 GiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7cd5fc0514efd96c9de266d321b37a8841c3fed","amp;dn":"Roswell+%281994%29+movie+-+The+UFO+cover-up+%28New+QualityDVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7cd5fc0514efd96c9de266d321b37a8841c3fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,205,95,192,81,78,253,150,201,222,38,109,50,27,55,168,132,28,63,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
