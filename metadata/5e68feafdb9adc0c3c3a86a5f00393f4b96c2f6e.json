He has built a new life for himself in the small Maine town of PastorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bay, but someone has discovered the truth about him. He is being tormented by anonymously sent reminders of his crime. He wants private detective Charlie Parker to make them go away.\n\nBut another girl has gone missing, this time from PastorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bay itself, and her family has its own secrets to protect. Now, in a town built on blood and shadowed by old ghosts, Parker must unravel a twisted history of violence and deceit involving the police and the FBI, a doomed mobster and his enemies, and Randall Haight himself.\n\nBecause Randall is telling lies. . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e68feafdb9adc0c3c3a86a5f00393f4b96c2f6e","amp;dn":"John+Connolly+-The+Burning+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e68feafdb9adc0c3c3a86a5f00393f4b96c2f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,104,254,175,219,154,220,12,60,58,134,165,240,3,147,244,185,108,47,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
