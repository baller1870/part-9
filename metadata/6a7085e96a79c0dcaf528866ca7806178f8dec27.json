Surrounded by men and women whose skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€œas doctors, nurses, and therapistsÃ¢â‚¬â€œseemed eminently more practical than her own, Rodriguez, a hairdresser and mother of two from Michigan, despaired of being of any real use. Yet she soon found she had a gift for befriending Afghans, and once her profession became known she was eagerly sought out by Westerners desperate for a good haircut and by Afghan women, who have a long and proud tradition of running their own beauty salons. Thus an idea was born.\n\nWith the help of corporate and international sponsors, the Kabul Beauty School welcomed its first class in 2003. Well meaning but sometimes brazen, Rodriguez stumbled through language barriers, overstepped cultural customs, and constantly juggled the challenges of a postwar nation even as she learned how to empower her students to become their familiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ breadwinners by learning the fundamentals of coloring techniques, haircutting, and makeup.\n\nYet within the small haven of the beauty school, the line between teacher and student quickly blurred as these vibrant women shared with Rodriguez their stories and their hearts: the newlywed who faked her virginity on her wedding night, the twelve-year-old bride sold into marriage to pay her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debts, the Taliban memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife who pursued her training despite her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s constant beatings. Through these and other stories, Rodriguez found the strength to leave her own unhealthy marriage and allow herself to love again, Afghan style.\n\nWith warmth and humor, Rodriguez details the lushness of a seemingly desolate region and reveals the magnificence behind the burqa. Kabul Beauty School is a remarkable tale of an extraordinary community of women who come together and learn the arts of perms, friendship, and freedom.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a7085e96a79c0dcaf528866ca7806178f8dec27","amp;dn":"Kabul+Beauty+School+-+Deborah+Rodriguez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a7085e96a79c0dcaf528866ca7806178f8dec27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,112,133,233,106,121,192,220,175,82,136,102,202,120,6,23,143,141,236,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
