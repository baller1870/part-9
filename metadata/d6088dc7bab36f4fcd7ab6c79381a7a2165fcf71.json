When it comes to scientific computing, NumPy is on the top of the list. NumPy will give you both speed and high productivity.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“NumPy CookbookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will teach you all about NumPy, a leading scientific computing library. NumPy replaces a lot of the functionality of Matlab and Mathematica, but in contrast to those products, it is free and open source.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Numpy CookbookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will teach you to write readable, efficient, and fast code that is as close to the language of Mathematics as much as possible with the cutting edge open source NumPy software library.\n\nYou will learn about installing and using NumPy and related concepts. At the end of the book, we will explore related scientific computing projects.\n\nThis book will give you a solid foundation in NumPy arrays and universal functions. You will also learn about plotting with Matplotlib and the related SciPy project through examples.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“NumPy CookbookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will help you to be productive with NumPy and write clean and fast code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6088dc7bab36f4fcd7ab6c79381a7a2165fcf71","amp;dn":"NumPy+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6088dc7bab36f4fcd7ab6c79381a7a2165fcf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,8,141,199,186,179,111,79,205,122,182,199,147,129,167,162,22,95,207,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
