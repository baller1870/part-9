The Sibelius concerto is distinguished by the tension between Linâ€™s passionate and virtuosic account of the solo part and Salonenâ€™s remarkable precision at the head of the orchestra. Listen, for example, to the remarkable rhythmic clarity at the opening of the finale, and to the way this serves to â€œfloatâ€ Linâ€™s daredevil pyrotechnics up above. Itâ€™s just marvellous. The same holds true of the Nielsenâ€“there is no finer account of this neglected concerto. Itâ€™s a rarity because in the finale Nielsen subordinates flash and dazzle to the workâ€™s overall emotional arc, progressing from anger to contentment. That doesnâ€™t mean the music isnâ€™t excellent, or that Lin and Salonenâ€™s performances arenâ€™t gripping from first note to last. They tear into the opening movement with apt ferocity and find the necessary emotional resolution in the workâ€™s amiable conclusion. The detailed, well-balanced sound ideally suits the interpretations.
