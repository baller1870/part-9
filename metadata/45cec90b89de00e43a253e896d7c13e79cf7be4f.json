One day, the evil Mr. Dark defeats Betilla, the Fairy, and steals the Great Protoon, the provider of harmony and balance. The Electoons who used to gravitate towards it lose their natural stability and scatter all over the world. Strange phenomena begin to occur: freaks and hostile characters appear, capturing every Electoon they can find! The disappearance of the Great Protoon also neutralized all of Betillaâ€™s powers, and she needs time to regenerate before she can help in any way. They definitely need a hero to save them, and it looks like youâ€™re it. Itâ€™s now up to Rayman and you to rescue the world.\r\n\r\nA truly classic platformer that started the famous Rayman series!\r\nRayman was awarded both &quot;Best Music in a CD-ROM Game&quot; and &quot;Best Animation&quot; in Electronic Gaming Monthly's 1995 Video Game Awards\r\nColorful graphics, addictive gameplay and a memorable main character made this title one of best selling games of all time\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: (XP, Vista, 7, 8) 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45cec90b89de00e43a253e896d7c13e79cf7be4f","amp;dn":"Rayman+Forever+%28v2.0.0.15%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45cec90b89de00e43a253e896d7c13e79cf7be4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,206,201,11,137,222,0,228,58,37,62,137,109,124,19,231,156,247,190,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
