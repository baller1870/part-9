S. Byatt, author of Possession).\n\n-----\n\n2008 film adaptation here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7034140&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7034140&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa6307ce4e95b65e471f9bcdbbdc61b575bd69e","amp;dn":"Anonymous+-+A+Woman+in+Berlin%2C+April+-+June+1945+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa6307ce4e95b65e471f9bcdbbdc61b575bd69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,166,48,124,228,233,91,101,228,113,249,188,219,189,198,27,87,91,214,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
