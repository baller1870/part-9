BudgieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival to restore her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old house puts her once more in the center of the communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social scene, and she insinuates herself back into Lily's friendship with an overpowering talent for seduction...and an alluring acquaintance from their college days, Yankees pitcher Graham Pendleton.
