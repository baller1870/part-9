It has been a while since our last minor release which makes 1.0.6 a more significant update than usual. With a new 3.12 kernel, a LUKS nuke feature, new Kali ARM build scripts, and Kali AMAZON AMI and Google Compute image generation scripts, not to mention numerous tool additions and updates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this release is really heavily laden with goodness. This new release brings with it the introduction of the Offensive Security Trusted ARM image scripts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a set of slowly growing scripts that are able to build Kali Linux images for various ARM devices. These scripts will replace the growing number of actual ARM image releases we have in order to reduce the exponentially growing amount of traffic we serve on each release.&quot; See the detailed release announcement for more information and useful links.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8734f499c17ee9b7d27591f00d726f07d8e8b9df","amp;dn":"Kali+Linux+1.0.6++64bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8734f499c17ee9b7d27591f00d726f07d8e8b9df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,52,244,153,193,126,233,183,210,117,145,240,13,114,111,7,216,232,185,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
