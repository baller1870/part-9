The instrumentals were released on April 27, 2010, exclusive to the iTunes store.\n\nPeriphery is easily one of the best albums of 2010 and you should go out and get a copy of their album. I put up this torrent for fans of Periphery, both who do and don't own the album, as well as for anyone who enjoys the technicality of the metal genre but is not partial to the screaming. Enjoy and seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1289ca3b695ecab3b17566672d5b2b31a759b8d1","amp;dn":"Periphery+%5BInstrumental+Version%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1289ca3b695ecab3b17566672d5b2b31a759b8d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,137,202,59,105,94,202,179,177,117,102,103,45,91,43,49,167,89,184,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
