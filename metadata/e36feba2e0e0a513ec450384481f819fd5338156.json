Through unseen \nhome movies, the film reveals how Otis's 1967 tour of Britain dramatically \nchanged his life and music. After bringing soul to Europe he returned to \nconquer America, first with the 'love-crowd' at the Monterey Festival and \nthen with Dock of the Bay, which topped the charts only after his death at \njust 26. Includes rare and unseen performances, intimate interviews with \nOtis's wife and daughter, and with original band members Steve Cropper and \nBooker T Jones. Also featured are British fans whose lives were changed by \nseeing him, among them Rod Stewart, Tom Jones and Bryan Ferry\n\n\nFORMAT:.......................: MKV\nCODEC:........................: X264\nFILE SIZE:....................: 450 MiB\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*406=16:9\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO MP2: ...................: 256 Kbps\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\nRUNTIME:......................: 59mn 39s\nENCODER:......................: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e36feba2e0e0a513ec450384481f819fd5338156","amp;dn":"Otis+Redding+Soul+Ambassador+x264+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e36feba2e0e0a513ec450384481f819fd5338156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,111,235,162,224,224,165,19,236,69,3,132,72,31,129,159,213,51,129,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
