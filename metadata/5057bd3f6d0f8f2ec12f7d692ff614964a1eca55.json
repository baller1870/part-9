Dazzling games are interspersed throughout with anecdotes and witty self-interviews, and in typically objective fashion he related both the downs and ups of his encounters.\n\nAn inveterate smoker and drinker, Tal's life on the circuit was punctuated by bouts in the hospital with kidney problems, but nothing could dull his love for chess and his sheer genius on the chessboard. His illustrious tournament record, up to his death in 1992, is included here in full, along with 100 complete games and nearly as many positions. Tal's annotations in this book are a world apart from ordinary games collections. No reader could fail to be swept along by his passion and vitality as he sets the scene for an encounter and then recounts every psychological twist and turn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5057bd3f6d0f8f2ec12f7d692ff614964a1eca55","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Games+of+Mikhail+Tal+%28Mikhail+Tal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5057bd3f6d0f8f2ec12f7d692ff614964a1eca55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,87,189,63,109,15,143,46,193,47,125,105,47,246,20,150,74,30,202,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
