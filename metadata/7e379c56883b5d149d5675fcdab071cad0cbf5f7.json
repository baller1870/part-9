Six core orchestral works by Aaron Copland - An Outdoor Overture, Our Town, Quiet City, Clarinet Concerto, Danzon Cubano and El Salon Mexico. I got these recordings over a period of time and have lost track of the performers. I do know the Clarinet Concerto is a performance by Benny Goodman (who commissioned it), with the composer conducting the Columbia Symphony. I think the last two are by the Detroit Symphony under Antal Dorati. All of these are excellent if not definitive performances of the works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e379c56883b5d149d5675fcdab071cad0cbf5f7","amp;dn":"Aaron+Copland+-+Works+for+Orchestra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e379c56883b5d149d5675fcdab071cad0cbf5f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,55,156,86,136,59,93,20,157,86,117,252,218,176,113,202,208,203,245,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
