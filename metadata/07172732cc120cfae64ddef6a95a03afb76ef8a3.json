Then her mentor, Dr. Sugar Dobbs, asks if she will join a few other select students to treat some very unusual animals.

And where BJ, tending to centaurs and griffins and magical cats, will discover the joy of healing and the wonder of magic\n\n\n#2 Under the Healing Sun\nBJ Vaughan has ventured beyond the frontiers of science to become a veterinarian in Crossroads--where she treats species she thought only existed in fantasy.
