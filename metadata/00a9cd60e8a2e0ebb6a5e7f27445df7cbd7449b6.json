It lets you change the melodies and harmonies of any recording by simply playing your own on a MIDI keyboard or creating a pitch map using our stream-lined GUI, and optionally corrects any tuning issues at the same time. As if that weren't enough, PITCHMAP provides functions to suppress individual sounds within a mix, and can apply advanced synthesizer-like sound transformations to your audio. In short, it is an inspiring musical instrument, a precision corrective tool and the only processor that literally lets you shape music with your hands.\n\nUNCHIRP is a plug-in for removing the most obnoxious artifacts associated with lossy audio encoding and other FFT based processes, such as spectral de-noising. Reduce musical noise, suppress high frequency chirping (also known as underwater sound, warbling or the tweeties), fix transient smearing, and restore lost high frequencies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNCHIRP does it all in one go. If you need to salvage poorly encoded music, speech that has gone through a low bit rate uplink, material that has been de-noised too strongly, or footage recorded with consumer mobile devices Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or if you simply want to add contour and vibrance to already great sounding recordings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNCHIRP is your (only) friend.\n\nUNFILTER is a real-time plug-in that removes filtering effects, such as comb filtering, resonance, or excessive equalization Ã¢â‚¬â€œ effectively linearizing the frequency response of a signal automatically. UNFILTER can also apply a detected filter response to another signal, or export it to disk as an impulse response, and can even perform mastering grade adaptive, free-form, and graphic equalization. Whether you're in music production, film post, game audio, broadcast, sound design, forensics, or engineering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ UNFILTER makes time-consuming and often impossible tasks as effortless as adjusting one control.\n\nUNVEIL is a real-time, de-mixing based plug-in that allows attenuating or boosting reverb components within a mixed signal of any channel count, including mono sources, as well as modifying reverb characteristics. Additionally, UNVEIL allows you to bring the key features of a recording into focus, or move them to the background, by attenuating or boosting perceptionally less important signal components. Based on our proprietary, artificial intelligence based MAP (Mixed-Signal Audio Processing) technology, UNVEIL allows fixing previously unusable location audio and dialog, tightening up live music recordings, removing reverb and Ã¢â‚¬Å“mudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from musical signals, as well as creative sound design.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Installation [dada]\n\nDisconnect of Internet.\nUninstall the previous version.\nInstall the four Plug-ins of once...\nWhen you finish installing the first Plugin, will appear window Authorizer:\nOpen KeygenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Select a product and switch &quot;LockÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nCopy and paste Serial Number in to Authorizer window and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ActivateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nCopy Installation ID and paste in to Keygen.
