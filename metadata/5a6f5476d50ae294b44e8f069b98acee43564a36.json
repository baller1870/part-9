Zargonnii warrior mercenaries are like nothing she has ever seen before. What do they want from her? The unearthly world Bay is taken to is fascinating, frightening and a lot different from Earth. Zargonnii males have never seen a small, vulnerable female. Their females are huge, aggressive, dominant; and the two sexes live apart for safety reasons.\n\nZane finds himself saddled with a bald, unusual pet Earth female. Females are anything but vulnerable in his world. This female is an oddity, and for some reason, his new pet brings on his mating cycle. Zane is mortified, until he discovers this intelligent pet of his has a secretÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no pet at all. It takes everything in ZaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power to control the temptation of his kindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breeding habitsÃ¢â‚¬â€until he can control it no more.\n\nCover: http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1370511624l/18042870.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6f5476d50ae294b44e8f069b98acee43564a36","amp;dn":"C.L.+Scholey+-+Bay%27s+Mercenary+%28Unearthly+World+%231%29+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BMOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6f5476d50ae294b44e8f069b98acee43564a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,111,84,118,213,10,226,148,180,78,143,6,155,152,172,238,67,86,74,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
