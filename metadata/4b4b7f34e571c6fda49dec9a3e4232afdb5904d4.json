For my own needs I rendered a VHS HiFi mint condition tape to DVD using Nero Recode and a little time. I feel that the finished product's quality and the archival importance is worth posting as an ISO image.\n\nVHS \nVideo: 4x3 aspect ratio\nVHS HiFi sound Quality\n\nThis first performance featured Irish Dancing Champions Jean Butler &amp; Michael Flatley, the RTE Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anuna with a score written by Bill Whelan. Whelan had also composed Timedance an early version of Riverdance for the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest, performed by Planxty. Most of the show's choreography was done by Flatley.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4b7f34e571c6fda49dec9a3e4232afdb5904d4","amp;dn":"Riverdance+The+Show+1995+w+Jean+Butler+%26+Michael+Flatley+%282nd.+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4b7f34e571c6fda49dec9a3e4232afdb5904d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,75,127,52,229,113,198,253,164,157,236,154,62,66,50,175,219,89,4,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
