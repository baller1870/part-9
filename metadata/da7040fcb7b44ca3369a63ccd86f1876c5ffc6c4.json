After examining film's close relation to other narrative media such as the novel, painting, photography, television, and even music, the book discusses the elements necessary to understand how films convey meaning, and, more importantly, how we can best discern all that a film is attempting to communicate. In addition, Monaco stresses the still-evolving digital context of film throughout--one of the new sections at the untrustworthy nature of digital images and sound--and his chapter on multimedia brings media criticism into the twenty-first century with a thorough discussion of topics like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the proximity of both to film.\nWith hundreds of illustrative black-and-white film stills and diagrams, How to Read a Film is an indispensable addition to the library of everyone who loves the cinema and wants to understand it better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da7040fcb7b44ca3369a63ccd86f1876c5ffc6c4","amp;dn":"How+to+Read+a+Film+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da7040fcb7b44ca3369a63ccd86f1876c5ffc6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,112,64,252,183,180,76,163,54,154,99,204,216,111,24,118,197,255,198,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
