It keeps the qualities that make her albums into old friends, that uniquely gorgeous voice and the profound, thoughtful lyrics. The album runs like a musical autobiography in which Harris opens up her soul and invites every listener to jump inside and feel her heartaches and her joy. Emmylou Harris has given us yet another album that is close to her own heard and is offering us yet another invitation to step in and look around at the walls of her soul.\n(review, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nEmmylou Harris - Red Dirt Girl 2000\n(Nonesuch)\n\n 1.
