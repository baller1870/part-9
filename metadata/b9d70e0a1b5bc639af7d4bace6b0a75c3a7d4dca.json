The title of the UK edition of the mag was similarly changed on issues number 19 and 20. Having earlier gotten wind of this, Warren Publications copyrighted the title and printed a few hundred copies of it's House of Horror #1, which forced Top Sellers to change the name, once again, to Hammer's Halls of Horror for issues number 21-23, after which the mag was canceled by  the parent publisher. In 1982, Halls of Horror returned (now published by Quality Communications Ltd.)  for a further seven issues and an all comics Dracula special issue.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d70e0a1b5bc639af7d4bace6b0a75c3a7d4dca","amp;dn":"House+of+Hammer-Hammer%5C%27s+Halls+of+Horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d70e0a1b5bc639af7d4bace6b0a75c3a7d4dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,215,14,10,27,91,198,57,175,125,75,172,230,176,167,92,58,125,77,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
