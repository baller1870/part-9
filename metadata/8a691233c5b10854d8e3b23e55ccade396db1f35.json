Raymond returns to memories of childhood     \n    with a simple apple tart made with a foolproof pastry    \n    and custard filling. Oven-baked apples prove that this    \n    simplest of fruit can create a dish without much work,     \n    with the addition of a calvados caramel sauce and         \n    toasted nuts. Next, apples get a savoury twist as they   \n    are marinated with lemon verbena and olive oil to         \n    accompany a confit of fresh salmon. Raymond's piece de     \n    resistance is an apple souffle prepared using a           \n    hollowed-out apple, served with a sabayon and apple      \n    sorbet.                                                   \n                                                               \n    Raymond travels to Kent to learn how to graft apples      \n    from fruit expert William Sibley, so that he can grow    \n    many different varieties of apples on one tree in his     \n    own soon-to-be planted orchard.                            \n                                                              \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a691233c5b10854d8e3b23e55ccade396db1f35","amp;dn":"Raymond.Blancs.Kitchen.Secrets.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a691233c5b10854d8e3b23e55ccade396db1f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,105,18,51,197,177,8,84,216,227,178,62,85,204,173,227,150,219,31,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
