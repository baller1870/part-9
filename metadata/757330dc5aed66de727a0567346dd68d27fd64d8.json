The movie features three generations of stuntmen played by Brian Keith, Reynolds, and Jan-Michael Vincent, the last as a cocky young stunt-star who urges Reynolds to perform his greatest stunt ever: leaping a rocket-powered car over a wide gorge (a stunt inspired by the real-life exploits of daredevil Evel Knievel). What's fun about no-brainers like Hooper is that Reynolds's brand of macho mischief never really goes out of style. It's dated, but it's always going to find an appreciative audience. If you liked Smokey and the Bandit you'll like this.\n\n  Starring: Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jan-Michael Vincent, Brian Keith, John Marley.\n\n  Directed by: Hal Needham.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 39min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 544","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:757330dc5aed66de727a0567346dd68d27fd64d8","amp;dn":"Hooper+%281978%29+%28Burt+Reynolds%2C+Sally+Field%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"757330dc5aed66de727a0567346dd68d27fd64d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,115,48,220,90,237,102,222,114,122,5,103,52,109,214,141,39,253,100,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
