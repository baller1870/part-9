Affordable Reliability Engineering: Life-Cycle Cost Analysis for Sustainability &amp; Logistical Support shows readers how to achieve the best cost for design development testing and evaluation and compare options for minimizing costs while keeping reliability above specifications. The text is based on the premise that all system sustainment costs result from part failure. It examines part failure in the design and sustainment of fielded parts and outlines a design criticality analysis procedure that reflects system design and sustainment.\n\nAchieve the Best Cost for Life-Cycle Sustainment\n\nProviding a framework for managers and engineers to develop and implement a reliability program for their organizations, the authors present the practicing professional with the tools needed to manage a system at a high reliability at the best cost. They introduce analytical methods that provide the methodology for integrating part reliability, failure, maintainability, and logistic math models. In addition, they include examples on how to run reliability simulations, highlight tools that are commercially available for such analysis, and explain the process required to ensure a design will meet specifications and minimize costs in the process.\n\nThis text:\n\nDemonstrates how to use information gathered from reliability investigations\nProvides engineers and managers with an understanding of a reliability engineering program so that they can perform reliability analyses\nSeeks to resolve uncertainty and establish the value of reliability engineering\nAffordable Reliability Engineering: Life-Cycle Cost Analysis for Sustainability &amp; Logistical Support focuses on reliability-centered maintenance and is an ideal resource for reliability engineers and managers. This text enables reliability professionals to determine the lowest life-cycle costs for part selection, design configuration options, and the implementation of maintenance practices, as well as spare parts strategies, and logistical resources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4940288900ef4156ad155e6e3a9b89917df873ed","amp;dn":"Affordable+Reliability+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4940288900ef4156ad155e6e3a9b89917df873ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,64,40,137,0,239,65,86,173,21,94,110,58,155,137,145,125,248,115,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
