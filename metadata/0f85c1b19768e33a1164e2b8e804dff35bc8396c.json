The title and subject matter were inspired by Stanley KubrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2001: A Space Odyssey and introduced the character of Major Tom. Some commentators have also seen the song as a metaphor for heroin use, citing the opening countdown as analogous to the drug's passage down the needle prior to the euphoric 'hit', and noting Bowie's admission of a &quot;silly flirtation with smack&quot; in 1968. His 1980 hit &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; declared &quot;We know Major Tom's a junkie&quot;.\n&quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; reflected a strong Bob Dylan influence, with its harmonica, edgy guitar sound and snarling vocal. &quot;Letter to Hermione&quot; was a farewell ballad to Bowie's former girlfriend, Hermione Farthingale, who was also the object of &quot;An Occasional Dream&quot;, a gentle folk tune reminiscent of the singer's 1967 debut album. &quot;God Knows I'm Good&quot;, Bowie's observational tale of a shoplifter's plight, also recalled his earlier style\n\nThe Man Who Sold the World\nThe album was written and rehearsed at Bowie's home in Haddon Hall, Beckenham, an Edwardian mansion converted to a block of flats that was described by one visitor as having an ambience &quot;like Dracula's living room&quot;. As Bowie was preoccupied with his new wife Angie at the time, the music was largely arranged by guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist/producer Tony Visconti. Although Bowie is officially credited as the composer of all music on the album, biographers such as Peter Doggett have marshaled evidence to the contrary, quoting Visconti saying &quot;the songs were written by all four of us. We'd jam in a basement, and Bowie would just say whether he liked them or not.&quot; In Doggett's narrative, &quot;The band (sometimes with Bowie contributing guitar, sometimes not) would record an instrumental track, which might or might not be based upon an original Bowie idea. Then, at the last possible moment, Bowie would reluctantly uncurl himself from the sofa on which he was lounging with his wife, and dash off a set of lyrics.&quot; Despite his exasperation with the singer's preoccupation with married life, Visconti would later rate The Man Who Sold the World his best work with Bowie until 1980's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps).\nMuch of the album had a distinct heavy metal edge that distinguishes it from Bowie's other releases, and has been compared to contemporary acts such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. The record also provided some unusual musical detours, such as the title track's use of Latin rhythms to hold the melody. The sonic heaviness of the album was matched by the subject matter, which included insanity (&quot;All the Madmen&quot;), gun-toting assassins and Vietnam War commentary (&quot;Running Gun Blues&quot;), an omniscient computer (&quot;Saviour Machine&quot;), and Lovecraftian Elder Gods (&quot;The Supermen&quot;). The song &quot;She Shook Me Cold&quot; was an explanation of a heterosexual encounter. The album has also been seen as reflecting the influence of such figures as Aleister Crowley, Franz Kafka and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC (image+.cue)\nAlbum List:\n\n1969 - Space Oddity (1999 EMI Remaster)\n01.
