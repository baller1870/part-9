He works for REMtemp, taking on other people's memories. It's illegal, but usually harmless. Maybe a petty criminal wants to pass a lie detector test. Or an unfaithful spouse wants to enjoy a guiltless affair. All Hap has to do is carry the memories for a couple of hours. It's easy money.\nUntil a beautiful young woman who committed murder leaves her memory with HapÃ¢â‚¬â€and won't take it back. Now Hap is on the run: from the LAPD, from six angels of death in gray suits and sunglasses, and from the best hit man in the businessÃ¢â‚¬â€his ex-wife.\nEven worse, people all around Hap are disappearing in a strange white light. His only hope is to negotiate with a guy who may be much more than he seems, so he can stay alive long enough to discover who is and who isn't...\n\nepub and mobi. author - michael marshall/marshall smith.\nenjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7196da474cbb124fcdaf2d55e429e223ea3f740","amp;dn":"One+of+us+By+Michael+Marshall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7196da474cbb124fcdaf2d55e429e223ea3f740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,25,109,164,116,203,177,36,252,218,242,213,94,66,158,34,62,163,247,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
