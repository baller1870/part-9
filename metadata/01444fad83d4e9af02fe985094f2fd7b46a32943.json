[Antennas To Heaven...]\n\nLift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, the much-anticipated follow-up to Godspeed You! Black Emperor's Slow Riot, is a double-disc achievement of four works (each with multiple parts): &quot;Storm,&quot; &quot;Static,&quot; &quot;Sleep,&quot; and &quot;Antennas to Heaven.&quot; It is a windfall for any fan of ambient pop, orchestral rock, space rock, or simply lush string arrangements who understands how powerful love, melancholy, and frustration can be. The main complaint voiced by critics of Godspeed's music is that their works just repeat the same pattern: start out sparse and slow, build-build-build, crescendo. While there are certainly crescendos, there is no such predictable pattern repeated among the works on Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven -- it's loaded with dynamics, unexpected sections, strong emotions and beauty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01444fad83d4e9af02fe985094f2fd7b46a32943","amp;dn":"Godspeed+You%21+Black+Emperor+-+Lift+Your...+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01444fad83d4e9af02fe985094f2fd7b46a32943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,68,79,173,131,212,233,175,2,254,152,80,148,242,253,123,70,163,41,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
