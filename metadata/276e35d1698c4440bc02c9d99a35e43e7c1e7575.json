Tom Baker continued as the Fourth Doctor. Lalla Ward, who played Princess Astra in the season 16 finale The Armageddon Factor, returned to the series as the newly regenerated Romana, replacing Mary Tamm in the role. After John Leeson declined to voice K-9 in this season, David Brierley replaced him in the final three serials (and Shada). Davros returns in Destiny of the Daleks this time played by David Gooderson.\n\nSeason 17 was intended to follow the same format as had every season since Season 13, with five 4-part serials and a 6-parter closing the season out. However, the planned final serial of the season, Shada, was affected by an industrial dispute involving the BBC's technicians; while the location filming and the first studio recording session were completed, the strike meant that the planned second studio session had to be cancelled. Although the dispute was resolved and plans put in place to continue work on the story, it was eventually shelved, as the BBC was concerned its Christmas productions might be affected.\n\nEpisode List:\n\n1.  Destiny of the Daleks - 4 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: The TARDIS lands the Fourth Doctor and Romana on a strangely\n    familiar planet. There, they meet the android Movellans, who are locked\n    in a war with the Daleks. The planet is Skaro, and in a bunker sits an\n    enemy long thought dead Ã¢â‚¬â€ Davros, creator of the Daleks.\n\n2.  City of Death - 4 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: The Doctor is enjoying a holiday in Paris with Romana when, armed\n    with several Mona Lisa's, he uncovers an alien conspiracy that could result\n    in the loss of all life on earth. \n\n3.  The Creature from the Pit - 4 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: On the planet Chloris, the Doctor, soon find themselves caught up\n    in a long and secret enmity between the Lady Adrasta, who rules the planet\n    in fear, and the mysterious Creature she keeps in a Pit.\n\n4.  Nightmare of Eden - 4 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: The TARDIS lands at the site of a hyper-spatial collision between\n    two spacecraft - as a result of which, neither ship is dimensionally stable,\n    risking the lives of all those aboard.\n\n5.  The Horns of Nimon - 4 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: After colliding with a spaceship, The Doctor, Romana and K-9 learn\n    young natives from a peaceful planet called Aneth are being transported into\n    a great labyrinth called &quot;The Power Complex&quot;. \n\n6.  Shada - 6 Episodes\n\n    Synopsis: The story revolves around the lost planet Shada, on which the Time\n    Lords built a prison for defeated would-be conquerors of the universe. Skagra,\n    an up-and-coming would-be conqueror of the universe, needs the assistance of\n    one of the prison's inmates, but finds that nobody knows where Shada is\n    anymore except one aged Time Lord who has retired to Earth.\n\n    NOTE: Episode 6, Shada, was never televised. It only became available as part\n          of The Legacy Box set. Nathan-Turner was eventually able to complete the\n          story (so far as was possible) by commissioning new effects shots, a\n          score and having Tom Baker record linking material to cover the missing\n          scenes to create six shortened episodes of between 14 and 22 minutes\n          each. The result was released on video in 1992.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276e35d1698c4440bc02c9d99a35e43e7c1e7575","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Season+17+-+%281979-80%29+-+26+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276e35d1698c4440bc02c9d99a35e43e7c1e7575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,110,53,209,105,140,68,64,188,2,201,217,154,53,228,62,124,30,117,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
