In addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo simulation for derivative pricing, which are used throughout the book. \n\nIn Chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices. As well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices. We look at the well-known process of Geometric Brownian Motion as well as mean reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.\n\nChapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of Enron Corp, discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets. This chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in detail the methods, merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2. Examples from crude, gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility.\n\nChapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets. Although such curves are well understood and straight-forward in most financial markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined curves. In this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments. We outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building forward curves in energy markets: the arbitrage approach, the econometric approach, and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors.\n\nChapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative markets and discusses their uses. Examples of products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback options, and ladder options..\n\nChapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives. Closed form solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest rate model.\n\nChapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options can be evaluated for the models in Chapter 6. Simulation schemes are developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a variety of path dependent options. In order to price options which incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is developed. This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard European and American style options.\n\nChapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve. The approach results in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves. The user defined volatility structures can be of an extremely general form. Closed-form solutions are developed for pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte Carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter closes with a discussion of the valuation of American style options.\n\nChapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions. In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem of managing the risk through time. We begin with delta hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging - illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models. The general model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.\n\nChapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value-at-risk (VaR) applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products. After discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs (volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR: Delta, Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the same portfolio of energy options. In this chapter we also look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market variables.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk. We look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan (1997)) and CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial Products (1997)) for which detailed information is publicly available. Together these provide an extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk. We present numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives.\n\n\nAbout the Authors\nLes Clewlow and Chris Strickland are the founding directors of Lacima Group through which they provide software, consulting and training services for energy risk management, valuation and optimisation.
