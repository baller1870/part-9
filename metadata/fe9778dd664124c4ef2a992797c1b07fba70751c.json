It's a lean, concise collection that tells you everything you need to know about Creedence. Several of the band's individual albums are essential, but Chronicle is not only an excellent introduction to the group, it offers definitive proof that the group was one of the definitive singles' bands of the late '60s. Rarely has a greatest- hits collection been so well-assembled. [The compact disc edition is hampered by the inclusion of the full-length, 11-minute album version of &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;; its presence slows down the momentum of the collection considerably.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9778dd664124c4ef2a992797c1b07fba70751c","amp;dn":"Creedence+Clearwater+Revival+Greatest+Hits+%5BFLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9778dd664124c4ef2a992797c1b07fba70751c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,151,120,221,102,65,36,196,239,42,153,39,151,193,176,127,186,112,117,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
