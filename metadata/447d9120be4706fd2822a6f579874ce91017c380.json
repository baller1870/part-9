Everyone knows Winston Churchill led Britain and her Allies in their struggle against Hitler; less well known is John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, who led Britain and her Allies against an earlier would-be dictator of Europe: the Sun King Louis XIV of France. John Churchill was Winston's ancestor, but he was more than that: he was his inspiration and he was his subject. Winston was a writer and historian before he was Prime Minister, and perhaps his greatest work is his massive, million-word biography of John Churchill, Marlborough: His Life and Times, published in four volumes between 1933 and 1938.\n\nFile Information:\nGeneral           : I:The Churchills.pt1.thebox.e45.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 144 Kbps\nLength            : 390 MiB for 47mn 39s 408ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 006 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nSpecial thanks to original cappers e45 and Hannibal.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447d9120be4706fd2822a6f579874ce91017c380","amp;dn":"Winston+Churchill+by+David+Starkey++%282012+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447d9120be4706fd2822a6f579874ce91017c380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,125,145,32,190,71,6,253,40,34,166,245,121,135,76,233,16,23,195,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
