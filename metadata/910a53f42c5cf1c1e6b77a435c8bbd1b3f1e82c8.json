Conceding that the earlier books may have been long on theory and light on practice, Covey and his team culled thousands of testimonials for examples of the principles in action. The resulting collection of more than 75 true stories will satisfy the full range of Covey constituents. Though the storytelling is always first-person, the focus is consistently on the underlying principle, reinforced by Covey&amp;#039;s commentary. Handily arranged by situationAwithin individual, family, community, workplace and educational settingsAand varying in depth and power, the stories offer intriguing and provocative lessons. They are mostly brief and often inspiring, but are by no means simplistic; they readily lend themselves to informal teaching and discussion. Some are dramatic and hard to forget: a woman facing a debilitating disease; a convict finding his mission while in prison. Many instructive stories deal with more routine problems, such as how to handle a sullen teenager sensitively or accommodate the needs of an elderly relative. Longer entries from executives of Shell Oil, Olivet College and Alphagraphics, and about the rejuvenation of South Bend, Ind., will appeal to strategic thinkers. This is a Covey classic.
