Her long and privileged life behind the Korean palace walls was not all it seemed, and the Red Queen (or her ghost) is still desperate to retell her tale.\n\nDr. Barbara Halliwell, with her own complicated past, seems the perfect envoy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ having read the memoirs of the Crown Princess on the plane to Seoul, Barbara has become utterly engrossed in her story. \n\nBut why has the Red Queen selected Barbara to keep her story alive, and what else does she want from her? As she explores the inner sanctums and the royal courts, Barbara Halliwell begins to feel a strong affinity for everything related to the princess and her mysterious life. After a brief, intense, and ill-fated love affair, she returns to London. Is she ensnared by the events of the past week, of the past two hundred years, or will she pick up her life where she left it?\n\nSet in eighteenth-century Korea and the present day, The Red Queen is a rich, playful, and atmospheric novel about love, about personal and public history, and what it means to be remembered. Beautifully told, ingeniously constructed, this novel reveals Margaret Drabble at her extraordinary best.\n\nGenre: Fiction | Historical Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04cb67fbfbb6fc01ccd6456988ba7a64378ba747","amp;dn":"The+Red+Queen+by+Margaret+Drabble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04cb67fbfbb6fc01ccd6456988ba7a64378ba747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,203,103,251,251,182,252,1,204,214,69,105,136,186,122,100,55,139,167,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
