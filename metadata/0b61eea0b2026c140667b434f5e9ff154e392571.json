An annual cycle of celebrations is included, as is advice on how to set up an altar and use simple tools. The author, a practitioner of Wicca (witchcraft), expounds the life-affirming, eco-feminist values of that tradition. Suggestions for rituals and ideas for inventing one's own are given.\r\n\r\nPoetry and blessings blend in a title which supports celebration of the Goddess image in daily life. These rituals are personal, moving rites which celebrate love and peace, and which act as meditations for considering new rituals, old traditions, and the course of women's lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b61eea0b2026c140667b434f5e9ff154e392571","amp;dn":"A+Woman%27s+Book+of+Rituals+%26amp%3B+Celebrations+%282011%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b61eea0b2026c140667b434f5e9ff154e392571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,97,238,160,178,2,108,20,6,103,180,52,245,233,255,21,78,57,37,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
