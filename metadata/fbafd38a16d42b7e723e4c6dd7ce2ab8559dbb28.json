We have designed this Ã¢â‚¬Å“instrumentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to give beat makers and crate diggers an instant library of royalty free, vinyl style Hip Hop samples. The software contains 800 unique hand crafted samples distributed across 50 included patches and with a new Ã¢â‚¬Å“crateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ expansion pack released monthly, you will never be short of ideas in the lab.\n\nWhen we released our debut plug-in Beat Machine a year ago, we knew many beat makers drum problems had been solved, 6 months later when Bass Engine was dropped onto the public, the low end problems encountered by so many was helped too. It became obvious to us that to complete the Hip Hop producers toolbox we had to make a plug-in that would allow producers to recreate sample influenced beats without the common problems associated with digging vinyl.\n\nCrate Digger has been inspired by the dusty, crackly atmospheres and chopped up sampling techniques utilised by Hip Hop producers in the 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 2000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. Due to the limited amount of sampling time MPCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had in this period, beat makers developed clever ways to create sonic soundscapes utilising short samples of Jazz, Funk, Rock and Soul vinyl records.\n\nUnlimited Beat Making Possibilities\n\nWithin this plug-in you will find rhodes chords, old synth riffs, chunky guitar stabs, orchestral runs and delicate piano melodies among a host of useful FX. We will also be releasing a new Ã¢â‚¬Å“crateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ collection every month covering every style of sampling and sonic creation you can think of, meaning this software will forever be expandable.\n\nYou now have the almost infinte beat making possibilities at your fingertips while having none of the worry of sample clearance issues or having to shell out $$$ on rare second hand 12Ã¢â‚¬Â³s\n\nGet Crate DigginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n- 800 quality crafted classic samples including stabs, chops, loops, FX and more\n- 50 themed patches all EQÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ed mixed and key grouped for instant use\n- 100% Royalty Free, all these samples are made from scratch by our own team of producers\n- 16 separate volume and pan controls\n- Velocity selection and Mono/Poly modes.\n- Built in flexible pitch and drive controls\n- Includes a built in analog style reverb\n- New Ã¢â‚¬Å“crateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ expansions will be released monthly\n- Ultra low CPU usage [perfect if you own a laptop / tablet / low spec PC/MAC]\n- Ultra fast patch loading [flick through patches in lightening quick times]\n- Program your chops manually or use a MIDI/USB controller/keyboard/MPD\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtscene.cc\ncastradio.net\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (04)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbafd38a16d42b7e723e4c6dd7ce2ab8559dbb28","amp;dn":"DopeVST+-+Crate+Digger+1.0+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbafd38a16d42b7e723e4c6dd7ce2ab8559dbb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,175,211,138,22,212,43,126,114,62,76,109,215,206,42,184,85,157,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
