And yet the longer he waits, the more he thinks he's losing his mind, if not his cool. A brutal, bloody and stylish noir story of a professional assassin lost in a world without a moral compass, this is a case study of a man alone, armed to the teeth and slowly losing his mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1be3769678aa826796a526c0978695d2e3d186","amp;dn":"The+Killer+Vol.+1+-+Long+Fire+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1be3769678aa826796a526c0978695d2e3d186","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,27,227,118,150,120,170,130,103,150,165,38,192,151,134,149,210,227,209,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
