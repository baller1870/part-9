The \n   unique sound of this machine has  been used by many artists over  the years \n   in the production of Electro, Hip-Hop and R n B.  \n             \n   The original 606  has been perfectly  emulated. However, since  Nithonat is \n   software  based,  D16  were  able  to  enhance  the  original  with   extra \n   functionality.  \n             \n   Full control over the sound \n             \n   On the original 606, the only editable sound parameter was volume. D16 have \n   added to  the original  and as  a result,  Nithonat is  equipped with extra \n   controls  which  allow each  sound  to be  shaped  in ways  which  were not \n   possible in the original machine.  \n             \n   A whole  spectrum of  sounds is  now at  you fingertips   rumbling  kicks, \n   rustling snares and completely synthesized and unnatural sounding toms  and \n   hi-hats.  \n             \n   For the  first time  since the  80s, it  is now  possible to  hear what the \n   analogue synthesis of the 606 is truly capable off!  \n             \n   One of a kind \n             \n   Nithonat  was designed  completely from  the ground  up. Its  synthesis is \n   special    even  when  compared to  Nephetons.  It  has  very unique  and \n   characteristic  hi-hat and  cymbal sounds  which are  due to  the emulated \n   structure of the circuits in  the original. The bass drum  has unparalleled \n   attack character and strong punch. The snare sounds sandy.  \n             \n   These unique attributes  guarantee that our  606 is not  a sub-standard 808 \n   but is  a great  instrument with  a unique  timbre which  will bring an old \n   school feel to any track it is used on.  \n             \n   New dimension of creativity \n             \n   Nithonat has  a powerful  built-in internal  sequencer. The  tracks can  be \n   edited in a  very simple and  intuitive way and  modified with many  useful \n   functions. The clear GUI means that sequencer is very easy to use.  \n             \n   In addition to having many  internal sequencer modes, Nithonat can  also be \n   used as a  sound module. All  sounds and functions  within Nithonat can  be \n   controlled from a host sequencer.  \n             \n   Experimenting with  Nithonat can  give interesting  and unexpected results. \n   Operation of  Nithonat is  very similar  to Drumazon  and Nepheton  having \n   knowledge of  these will  mean that  using Nithonat  will not  require much \n   manual reading!  \n             \n   Good choice \n             \n   For a fraction of the price  of Drumazon and Nepheton, Nithonat provides  a \n   drum  machine  which  has  as many  editing  tools  as  its more  expensive \n   siblings.  \n             \n   We believe that we  have created a powerful  drum machine at an  affordable \n   price which is quick to program and very easy to use.  \n             \n   Another D16 classic!  \n             \n             \n   Full Features: \n             \n             \n   fully synthesized drum sounds  \n             \n   additional parameters to get yet more control over the sound  \n             \n   many ways of controlling the device:  \n             \n   external mode (notes triggering the sounds)  \n             \n   internal sequencer (pattern mode)  \n             \n   internal sequencer:  \n             \n   8 banks with 12 patterns per bank  \n             \n   each pattern up to 16 steps of length  \n             \n   each pattern defined with one of four available measures  \n             \n   shuffle mode  \n             \n   trigger out  \n             \n   global accent track  \n             \n   tap mode  \n             \n   chain mode  \n             \n   shuffle (swing) and tempo values defined per pattern  \n             \n   built in randomizer  \n             \n   patterns import/export via human readable xml files  \n             \n   two modes of synchronization:  \n             \n   precise synchronization to the host tempo  \n             \n   synchronization to internal  clock - tempo  controlled in the  range 30-300 \n   BPM (+-0.1)  \n             \n   mutes/solos for each instrument (affect triggerring not just the signal)  \n             \n   dynamic signal routing from instruments to outputs  \n             \n   drum kits organised into groups  \n             \n   midi learn function  \n             \n   64bit internal processing  \n             \n             \n             \n   Changes in v1.4.0 \n             \n             \n   fixed issue with preset name keyboard focus  \n             \n   fixed hanging GUI issue during simultaneous work with other d16 plugins  \n             \n   fixed issue with loading/saving current pattern \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Use Keygen to create your Nithonat.key \n                     and copy it into installation folder \n                            \n                  3) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341769c3c9096c152517f28a7ee8eb9260bd7077","amp;dn":"D16.Group.Nithonat.VSTi.v1.4.0.Incl.Keygen-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341769c3c9096c152517f28a7ee8eb9260bd7077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,23,105,195,201,9,108,21,37,23,242,138,126,232,235,146,96,189,112,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
