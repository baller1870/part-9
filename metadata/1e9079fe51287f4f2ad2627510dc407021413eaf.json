Professor Quigley (President ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history professor at Georgetown University) was a trusted supporter of this organization and was given access to its private papers. When his book was released by a major New York publishing house, it was expected that it would be read only by academics who are interested in the organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history and sympathetic to its goals. However, when it began to be quoted by critics, the publisher withdrew the book from print. This led to the appearance of an underground version that circulated throughout the 1970s and 80s. Eventually, the publisher was pressured into authorizing this official reprint edition, which is an exact replica of the original. It is a mammoth history interspersed with startling information about the secret organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impact on almost every major event of modern history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9079fe51287f4f2ad2627510dc407021413eaf","amp;dn":"Carroll+Quigley+-+Tragedy+and+Hope+%281st+Edition%2C+1966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9079fe51287f4f2ad2627510dc407021413eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,144,121,254,81,40,127,79,42,210,98,117,16,220,64,112,33,65,62,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
