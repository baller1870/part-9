Canadian acoustic blues icon Big Dave McLean is also a supreme storyteller whose relentless touring spanning four decades has provided grist for the mill for countless fans from coast-to-coast, inducing them to pour into juke joints, coffee houses and concert halls to hear his raw, passionate and gravelly vocals. One moment heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weaving heartfelt stories bone-jarring immediacy and the next moment heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s regaling us with time-honored treasures culled from such influences as Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Sleepy John Estes. As a teenager growing up in Winnipeg during the early 70s, Dave never missed a gig whenever touring Chicago vets like Johnny Shines, Roosevelt Sykes and especially Muddy Waters came to town. They took an instant liking to the fledgling musician and saw their reflection in his own dedication to his craft.\n\nKnown for his ragged yet virtuosic slide guitar technique and growling, Howlin' Wolf-inspired vocals, Big Dave McLean has always reminded listeners of the blues' down-home roots. McLean once again draws the listener into a forgotten world of dirt roads, juke joints, and creaky back porches, wailing and moaning like a man possessed. McLean even manages to work his mojo on the over-recorded standard &quot;Good Morning Little School Girl,&quot; focusing in on the song's decidedly sleazy underpinnings.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
