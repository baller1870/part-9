As practiced for more than twenty-six hundred years, the process involves working with, rather than against, our depression, anxiety, and compulsions. We do this by recognizing the habitual ways our minds perceive and react Ã¢â‚¬â€ the way they mislead. The lively exercises and inspiring real-world examples Cayton provides can help you transform intractable problems and neutralize suffering by cultivating a radically liberating self-understanding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ceccfa7906358d7934a293d987627c8954e0e0","amp;dn":"The+Misleading+Mind%3A+How+We+Create+Our+Own+Problems+and+How+Budd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ceccfa7906358d7934a293d987627c8954e0e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,206,204,250,121,6,53,141,121,52,162,147,217,135,98,124,137,84,224,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
