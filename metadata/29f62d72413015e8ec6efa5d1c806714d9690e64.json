After releasing some demo tapes and a mini-CD, they were able to release an album in 1994, the debut World of Sin. Shortly after this, their record company Blue Merle went bankrupt, and Martin decided to put the band on hiatus.\r\n\r\nAbout two years later, Martin found four new members (Andreas, Jan, Markus, &amp; Claudius) and recorded the album The Final Command. In 1999, Chalice of Steel was released. In 2001, Paragon released Steelbound, engineered and produced by Piet Sielck of Iron Savior. Piet has worked with the band on every album since then.\r\n\r\nAfter the recording of Forgotten Prophecies in early 2007, the band's longtime bass player Jan BÃ¼nning quit the band because of &quot;musical differences.&quot; Shortly after the band had found a replacement in Dirk Seifert.\r\n\r\nIn late 2007 the band changed labels to Massacre Records and released Screenslaves in 2008.\r\n\r\nIn the mid to ending months of 2009, Paragon took a break. During this time they lost two members. Guitarist GÃ¼nny Kruse who had played on their three studio albums between 2005â€“2008, and also bassist Dirk Seifert who only played on &quot;Screenslaves&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 the album &quot;Force Of Destruction&quot; was released.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, 2014, Paragon announced a new album will be released in late 2015 on the bands 25th anniversary.\r\n\r\n  \r\nALBUM : Hell Beyond Hell\r\n    \r\nYEAR: 2016\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: Germany\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Heavy Metal\r\n    \r\nDURATION:\t0:45:46\r\n    \r\nFILE FORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n01.
