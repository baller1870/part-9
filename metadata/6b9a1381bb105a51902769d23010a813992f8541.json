A good HDTV encode of S06E15 didn't exist, so I had to make my own from the 720p release.\r\n\r\nBTW, in the middle of season 3 you see the scene transition from Xvid to x264, and with S07E23 their transition from MP4 to MKV.\r\n\r\nI'm seeding this with my seedbox.\r\n\r\nEnjoy, comment and share!\r\n\r\n----\r\nIf you really want to thank me for my work, I'd really appreciate a Bitcoin donation: 19WZf4bGMgKj2K5E6N5NaP1vpNgXJeuGpT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9a1381bb105a51902769d23010a813992f8541","amp;dn":"Shark+Tank+Season+1-7+%28HDTV%29%28Scene%29%28Seedbox%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9a1381bb105a51902769d23010a813992f8541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,154,19,129,187,16,90,81,144,39,105,210,48,16,168,19,153,47,133,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
