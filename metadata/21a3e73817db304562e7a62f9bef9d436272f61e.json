Alco Locomotives is the first book to tell the full story of this company central to American railroad historyÃ¢â‚¬â€and beloved by railfans for its rich heritage and its underdog appeal. Noted rail historian Brian Solomon looks back at the founding of Schenectady Locomotive Works in 1848 and proceeds to cover that companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s merger with several smaller locomotive builders in 1901 to form Alco. Solomon describes the locomotives that made AlcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name around the world, from the standard designs like Mikados, Atlantics, and Mallets to the more powerful and flashy postÃ¢â‚¬â€œWorld War I models. His detailed, richly illustrated narrative re-creates the drama of a tough, ambitious company in the American traditionÃ¢â‚¬â€rising again and again to the demands of an ever-changing industry and economy.\nSolomon also covers Alco electrics (built in partnership with GE), as well as the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successful and quirky diesel offerings, including the RS-2 and RS-3 road switchers, FA/FB road freight units, PA road passenger diesel, and the wares of Canadian affiliate Montreal Locomotive Works. Enlivened by numerous historical photographs, modern images, curious details, and firsthand accounts, this history is a complete, fascinating, and fitting tribute to a true icon of American railroading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21a3e73817db304562e7a62f9bef9d436272f61e","amp;dn":"Alco+Locomotives+%28US+Railways+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21a3e73817db304562e7a62f9bef9d436272f61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,163,231,56,23,219,48,69,98,231,166,47,155,239,157,67,98,114,246,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
