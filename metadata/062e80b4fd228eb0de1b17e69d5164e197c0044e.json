A fascinating visual poem, the film is a silent piece that cascades with solar flares, bursts of colour, artificial light and vibrant scratches across film. It is as far from a linear narrative as you could get and as such is very liberating. Maybe this is the most real kind of film you could find.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062e80b4fd228eb0de1b17e69d5164e197c0044e","amp;dn":"Stan+Brakhage+-+Dog+Star+Man+%281961-64%2C+Dvd%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062e80b4fd228eb0de1b17e69d5164e197c0044e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,46,128,180,253,34,142,176,222,27,23,230,157,81,100,225,151,192,4,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
