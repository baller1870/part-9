Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the band consisted of Tanya \n\nDonelly on lead vocals, Fred Abong bass, Tom Gorman guitar, and Chris \n\nGorman drums. The band had an alternative rock sound that was uniquely \n\nmixed with both a twist of pop-reminiscent haunted melodies (much like \n\nthose of Julee Cruise and the Cocteau Twins) and an occasional country \n\nmusic-like twang, which made it popular with college students searching \n\nfor indie rock bands.\n\nAlbum:\n\n1.
