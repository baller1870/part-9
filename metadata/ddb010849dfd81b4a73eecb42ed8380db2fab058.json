The answer, of course, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“yes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ To greatly simplify, E.U. law now holds that a recording is protected for 75 years under copyright in the E.U. (the period previously was 50 years) but only if that recording has been released. As a result of this change in law, the past couple of years have seen collections issuing rarities from Bob Dylan, The Beatles, the Motown family of artists and The Beach Boys, simply to keep these recordings in copyright. Last year, Capitol issued The Big Beat 1963 with a number of Brian Wilson/Beach Boys titles. Following suit, the label released two more Beach Boys titles. 1964: Keep an Eye on Summer has 46 session highlight and rarities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many of which have never even been bootlegged Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while Live in Sacramento 1964 has the two full shows from which the original Beach Boys Concert LP was culled.\n\n\n\nMark Linett and Alan Boyd have produced these two new (and alas, digital-only) releases, and Linett has remastered all tracks.  Capitol/Brother Records has happily provided detailed liner notes, including comprehensive track-by-track annotations, at The Beach BoysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ official website.  Boyd writes, in part, that Ã¢â‚¬Å“This new collection, made possible by the fact that the Beach Boys, starting in 1964, made a point of holding onto their work reels (and greatly enhanced by the recent recovery of some long lost tapes from the Shut Down Vol. 2 album sessions) shows the Beach Boys at their zenith, offering glimpses of the camaraderie, optimism and high spirits behind the creation of these timeless records, and highlighting the incredible vocal arrangements, compositional skills, and rapidly evolving production techniques that placed the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson at the forefront of pop music in 1964 and for all time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nLinett adds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“On this set weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve presented highlights from many of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sessions during 1964, mostly previously unreleased (even on those Ã¢â‚¬ËœunofficialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ discs often found at record shows). As someone who has been listening to, archiving and mixing the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings for nearly thirty years, it was exciting for me to hear these newly discovered sessions for the first time. They fully demonstrate that the Beach Boys were great musicians as well as singers and that, contrary to popular opinion, they played on most of their records, with the occasional addition of members of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwrecking crew.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb010849dfd81b4a73eecb42ed8380db2fab058","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Keep+an+Eye+On+Summer+The+Beach+Boys+Sessions+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb010849dfd81b4a73eecb42ed8380db2fab058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,176,16,132,157,253,129,180,167,62,236,180,46,216,56,13,178,250,176,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
