The fascinating story that Hill tells is a work of the soul and the imagination. Aminata is a character who will stir listeners, from her kidÂ­napping from Africa through her journeys back and forth across the ocean.\r\nEnslaved on a South Carolina plantation, Aminata works in the indigo fields and as a midÂ­wife. When she is bought by an entrepreneur from Charleston, she is torn from friends and family. The chaos of the Revolutionary War allows her to escape. In British-held Manhattan, she helps pen the Book of Negroes, a list of blacks rewarded for wartime service to the King with safe passage to Nova Scotia. During her travels in Canada, Sierra Leone, and England, Aminata strives for her freeÂ­dom and that of her peopleâ€“even when it comes at a price.\r\nIn this captivating novel, Hill portrays one woman's remarkable spirit and strength in the face of adversity, and he brings to life crucial and little-known chapters in world history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882a9cd1b5449ca5e250ee1c3728199089d7564c","amp;dn":"Lawrence+Hill-Someone+Knows+My+Name","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882a9cd1b5449ca5e250ee1c3728199089d7564c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,42,156,209,181,68,156,165,226,80,238,28,55,40,25,144,137,215,86,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
