Knowing the immense notoriety this performance has gained, it's funny to think EC originally didn't want to release it, because he thought that his fans would not take to it. He said that he always enjoyed playing these classic, blues numbers on his acoustic guitars at home, but never realized that other people would find them of interest. Well, being that this is probably, the most popular 'Unplugged' performance from the series, I guess he was wrong.\n\nEric Clapton\nUnplugged (1992)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\nApprox 142Mb\n\nTrax\n01  Signe \n02  Before You Accuse Me \n03  Hey Hey \n04  Tears In Heaven \n05  Lonely Stranger \n06  Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out \n07  Layla \n08  Running On Faith \n09  Walkin' Blues \n10  Alberta \n11  San Francisco Bay Blues \n12  Malted Milk \n13  Old Love \n14  Rollin' &amp;amp; Tumblin' \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d663d6191664994089c7e1ecc95455e06a3d733f","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Unplugged+%281992%29+%40+320+%2B+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d663d6191664994089c7e1ecc95455e06a3d733f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,99,214,25,22,100,153,64,137,199,225,236,201,84,85,224,106,61,115,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
