A brief review is presented about a very interesting application of laser beams in the fields of materials science: the growth of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructured films by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). In addition, safe and precise cavity detection, especially of dangerous or inaccessible voids, is essential to safe production in a working mine. The advantages and disadvantages of laser detection systems are analysed, and a combination of laser scanning techniques and conventional survey methodology is proposed. Other chapters in this book present an overview on laser cladding, a discussion of the applications of structured laser beams in laser refractography technology, a review of some fundamentals of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and an analysis of laser forming of steel parts by means of diode lasers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca7aa53ed6c084f8b04d78cbe976d3eeb2c5b90","amp;dn":"Laser+Beams%3A+Theory%2C+Properties+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ca7aa53ed6c084f8b04d78cbe976d3eeb2c5b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,167,170,83,237,108,8,79,139,4,215,140,190,151,109,62,235,44,91,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
