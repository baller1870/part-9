The first 13 sides find the guitarist in tandem with pianist Wilson &quot;Thunder&quot; Smith (who handles the vocals on a few tracks), but after that, old Lightnin' Hopkins went the solo route. &quot;Katie May,&quot; &quot;Short Haired Woman,&quot; &quot;Abilene,&quot; &quot;Shotgun&quot; -- all these and more rate with his seminal performances.\n\n\nTracks:\n(Disc 1)\n1.
