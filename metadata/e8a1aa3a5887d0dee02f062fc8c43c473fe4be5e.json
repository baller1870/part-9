An unidentified young woman is found brutally murdered in a seedy section of the city, her body laced with bruises, her sharp fingernails digging into her palms. Her eyes are staring up at something in pure fear.\n\nNobody knows who she is.\n\nAs Brian and his team begin to piece together the clues, the answers lead him to places he would least expect. The further Brian digs, one question soon becomes apparent: who can he trust? The answer, it seems, may be life-threatening.\n\nThe first in a new series from author Ryan Casey, Dying Eyes is a dark detective mystery with complex characters and a twisting, turning plot that is sure to please fans of the crime thriller genre. If you enjoy hit Danish TV phenomenon, The Killing, you'll love Dying Eyes.\n\n&quot;With twists and turns aplenty, the story is both riveting and horrifying, and it is well-worth reading and re-reading.&quot; - T.A.
