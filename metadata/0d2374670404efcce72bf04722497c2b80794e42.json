In 2008 his Hope for the Hopeless didn't stray too far from the songwriter's comfort zone, though a partnership with producer John Alagia (Dave Matthews Band, John Mayer) led to a high level of production not yet heard on any of his albums. In 2011, DennenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Loverboy was his biggest departure to date: a danceable collection of songs influenced by the road and recorded by a studio filled with friends and imperfect takes. Smoke and Mirrors, his fifth release, came out last October, and earned his first single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wild ChildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a #5 spot at AAA Radio. Dennen took his record on the road for a sold out headline tour to wrap up 2013, and is currently on tour, recently selling out shows in Boston, DC, and Nashville, with upcoming dates in Aspen, Santa Barbara, Santa Ana and Park City. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also perform as part of the Paul Simon Tribute at New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Carnegie Hall on March 31, before heading to Europe to tour with John Butler Trio. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll perform at select festivals across the US this summer.
