The VHK discovered a new method of playing music, which is not a simple improvisation but a completely free creation of music born on stage, liberating the deepest musical creative power, as well as playing more or less pre-written materials. This music is called as shamanistic/psychedelic hardcore but is in reality an unrestricted outburst of life energy. This is not only a music, but an attitude to grasp the essence of life with our deepest nature and grow it by its own law. The group says it is a magical natural music, a cosmic vision about the origin of presence. It develops in a sovereign way as a self-revelation with its elementary power.\n\nThe VHK is a distinguished cultic band in Hungary as well as in Germany. The first eight concerts were interrupted by the authorities in an afraid from the consequences. The band was banished for eleven years, nevertheless even at that time it continuously found spontaneous occasions to act by chance pushed by the audience of an other group, or simply playing by pseudonyms, as guest musicians of friend bands and without declaring themselves as a band at their the concert.\n\nMeantime they won the festival of the experimental film studio in 1981. The video of this event was presented many times in the West German TV. GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡bor BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dy, the internationally famous and youngly died film-director made his film &quot;Dog's Night Song&quot; with them, including the lead howler Attila Grandpierre in one of the featuring roles. VHK plays from 1984 regularly in the West. In 1986, when Amsterdam was the &quot;cultural capital of Europe&quot;, the Dutch Queen, Beatrix personally intervened at the Hungarian authorities in order to allow the guest performance of the band. A similar event happened in 1987 when Fred Sinowatz, the Austrian chancellor had to interact with the Hungarian Ministry of Culture. They played in the &quot;Mythen, Monstren and Mutationen&quot; festival in Berlin, Tempodrom, 1988, together with La Fura dels Baus, where VHK was the best surprise (Zitty Berlin, 1988). EinstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rzende Neubauten, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Iggy Pop regarded VHK as one of the most important bands. VHK hosted Rollins Band in Hungary where they were shocked on the overwhelming effect of VHK on the audience. Rollins Band invited VHK for a tour in England which occured in 1989. In 1992, the CD &quot;Hammering on the Gates of Nothingness&quot; reached the 2nd position on the Top-100 list of the year of a Belgian Radio. Dietmar Lupfer, the first manager of the band, and later on the famous American cult label Alternative Tentacles released &quot;Teach Death a Lesson&quot; (1988), &quot;Jump Out the World-Instinct&quot;(1990), &quot;Hammering on the Gates of Nothingness&quot; (1992). The London chief of Alternative Tentacles Bill Gilliam described the music of VHK as &quot;primal God-feeling&quot;.\n\nMany American managers suggested VHK to play in USA, telling that &quot;every American band wants to play such a music what you, do but they cannot.&quot; The VHK released the live-album &quot;Giant Space!&quot;(1994). Dietmar took the band to the New Music Seminar in 1990, New York. The New York Times wrote &quot;the Coroner's music is basic and elemental and filled with obsessive, galvanizing passion.&quot; Melody Maker wrote on their show at the Pop Komm!, the large international festival of Germany, where they get the greatest power on the audience. VHK played in the Steirischer Herbst '95, completed with the fellows of Les Tambours du Bronx, 27 people on the same stage. VHK attracted 40000 people in 1996 in the DiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ksziget (Student's Island) festival, one of the biggest festivals of Europe, and reached an extraordinary effect on the crowd. Iggy Pop declared them as the most interesting band today (1996). Our recent CD's\n\n&quot;The Reconquering of the Eden - 1st attack, and 2nd attack&quot; (1997, 1998) is of a band radically improved, with a new guitarist and bassist, and invited musicians playing on contrabass, violin, flute, hurdy-gurdy and cymbal. The VKH used basically two sounds: one with the greatest energy for the electric songs and one which they developed themselves which is an unusually natural and vital dreamspace for the acoustic songs. We second part of the album is recorded in a large hall to record in a live atmosphere in May, 1998. The &quot;Reconquering Eden - 2nd attack&quot; was released on August 5, 1998. Both of these CDs reached the Top-40 of the Hungarian best-selling records and stayed there for 3 months. People are usually very much intensified and surprised when seeing VKH alive on stage nowadays, still.\n\n\n1988 - A HalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡l MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³resre TanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sa (Teach Death a Lesson)\n1990 - A VilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶sztÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶n KiugrasztÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡sa (Jump Out the World-Instinct)\n1992 - A Semmi Kapuin DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶mbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶lve (Hammering on the Doors of Nothingness)\n1994 - OriÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©r!
