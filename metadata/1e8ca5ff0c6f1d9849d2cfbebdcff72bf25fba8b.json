ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doubtful that the true nature, sheer enormity and complete obscenity of such an event can ever be conveyed on the screen and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s telling that perhaps the most effective film on the subject ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alain RenaisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ short documentary film Night and Fog (Nuit et Brouillard) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is mercifully concise and restrained, yet ugly, brutal and shocking. Even SpielbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SchindlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s List is weighed down by its distancing glamorous cinematography and well-meaning pathos that distorts its message with bloated sentimentality. One other way of dealing with the subject ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which many feel is no more effective ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is to attempt to confront the subject with humour since the matter is too absurd to confront rationally, as in Roberto BenigniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Life Is Beautiful. This black, absurdist approach is taken by Robert ShawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial stage play and its American Film Theatre adaptation, The Man In The Glass Booth.\n\nThe plot was inspired by actual events surrounding the kidnapping and trial of Adolf Eichmann. Arthur Goldman is Jewish and a Nazi death camp survivor. Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli secret agents burst in and kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman's trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but their own as well.\n\nShawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play takes an interesting angle on survivorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guilt, the deep-rooted psychosis that the Holocaust has had on the Jewish psyche and plunges deep and controversially into many previously unexplored areas, but ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at least in Arthur HillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s filmed version of the drama for the American Film Theatre ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t succeed, coming across as too damned clever to really get to the nature of the survivorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trauma. \n\nDescribing the play as an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œintellectual thrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Arthur Hiller says the play was re-written for the screen by AFT script-editor Edward Anhalt in order to give it more emotional charge. He talks about ShawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dislike of the screenplay and his decision to remove his name from anywhere on the credits, but claims that Shaw changed his mind when he saw the finished film.\n\nAcademy Awards, USA \n1976  Nominated Oscar Best Actor in a Leading Role Maximilian Schell  \n\nGolden Globes, USA \n1976  Nominated Golden Globe Best Motion Picture Actor - Drama Maximilian Schell  \n\nWriters Guild of America, USA \n1976  Nominated WGA Award (Screen) Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium Edward Anhalt \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8ca5ff0c6f1d9849d2cfbebdcff72bf25fba8b","amp;dn":"The+Man+in+the+Glass+Booth+%5B1974%5D+Maximillian+Schell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8ca5ff0c6f1d9849d2cfbebdcff72bf25fba8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,140,165,255,12,111,29,152,73,210,207,190,189,207,247,43,242,95,186,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
