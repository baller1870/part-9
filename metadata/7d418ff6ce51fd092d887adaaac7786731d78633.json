The band released only two albums during its first seven years, and finally found mainstream success with a self-titled release in 1996. It proved to be Sublime's last proper album, however, as lead singer Brad Nowell died in May 1996, just two months before the record's release. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Trenchtown Rock\n02.Doin' Time (Original Version)\n03.Wrong Way\n04.Paddle Out\n05.What I Got (Album Version)\n06.Pawn Shop\n07.April 29, 1992 (Miami)\n08.Santeria\n09.Seed\n10.Jailhouse\n11.Caress Me Down (Album Version)\n12.The Ballad Of Johnny Butt\n13.Under My Voodoo\n14.Burritos\n15.Same In The End\n16.Get Ready\n17.What I Got (Reprise)\n18.Garden Grove\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.I Love My Dog\n02.Superstar Punani\n03.April 29, 1992 (Miami) (Alternate Version)\n04.Saw Red (Acoustic)\n05.Little District (Acoustic)\n06.Zimbabwe (Acoustic)\n07.What I Got (Alternate Version)\n08.Doin' Time (Uptown Dub)\n09.Doin' Time (Eerie Splendor Version)\n10.Doin' Time (Remixed By Wyclef Jean)\n11.Doin' Time (Remixed By Marshall Arts)\n12.Doin' Time (Marshall Arts Instrumental Version)\n13.April 29, 1992 (Instrumental Version)\n14.Caress Me Down (Instrumental Version)\n15.What I Got (Instrumental Version)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n              ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d418ff6ce51fd092d887adaaac7786731d78633","amp;dn":"Sublime+10th+Anniversary+Deluxe+Edition+%282006%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d418ff6ce51fd092d887adaaac7786731d78633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,65,143,246,206,81,253,9,45,136,122,218,170,199,120,103,49,215,134,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
