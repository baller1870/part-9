Recording sessions for the album took place at New York City's Sorcerer Sound Studio and Shokan's Allaire Studios in 2001. Although genre classification has been disputed, Jones' mellow style and playing on Come Away with Me is recognized as contemporary jazz. The album's critical and commercial success was a breakthrough for Jones in 2002, as it reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart and several jazz charts. The album also topped many critics' &quot;albums of the year&quot; lists and gathered major music awards in the process, including six Grammy Awards. Following initial sales, Come Away with Me was certified diamond by the RIAA on February 15, 2005 having sold over 10 million copies in its first three years of release and this album has shipped over 20 million copies worldwide and it nevertheless became Jones's best-selling album, the tenth best-selling album of the 2000s, and was also the most successful Jazz album of all time, beating Kind of Blue by Miles Davis.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Michael Ross - It is not just the timbre of Norah Jones's voice that is mature beyond her 22 years. Her assured phrasing and precise time are more often found in older singers as well. She is instantly recognizable, blending shades of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone without sounding like anyone but herself. Any way you slice it, she is a singer to be reckoned with. Her readings of the Hank Williams classic &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; and Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; alone are worth the price of the CD. Jones's own material, while not bad, pales a bit next to such masterpieces. They might have fared better had she and producer Arif Mardin opted for some livelier arrangements, taking better advantage of brilliant sidemen such as Bill Frisell, Kevin Breit, and Brian Blade; or if the tunes had simply been given less laconic performances. Jones has all the tools; what will come with experience and some careful listening to artists like J.J. Cale and Shirley Horn is the knack of remaining low-key without sounding sleepy--sometimes less is not, in fact, more.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Don't Know Why\n[02] Seven Years\n[03] Cold Cold Heart\n[04] Feelin' The Same Way\n[05] Come Away With Me\n[06] Shoot The Moon\n[07] Turn Me On\n[08] Lonestar\n[09] I've Got To See You Again\n[10] Painter Song\n[11] One Flight Down\n[12] Nightingale\n[13] The Long Day Is Over\n[14] The Nearness Of You\n \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time.  .....&gt; 00h:45m:03s\n\nTotal File Size......ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦....&gt; 111mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size......ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.....&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.  ....&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video FormatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦    ....&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork.....  .....&gt; Yes @ 300dpi \n\nOriginal CD Rip......
