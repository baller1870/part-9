Sacked from his previous job on the railways for assaulting a superior - ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne was originally to have been the central character in Zola's &quot;murder on the trains&quot; thriller La BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªte humaine (1890), before the overwhelmingly positive reaction to Germinal persuaded him otherwise - he befriends the veteran miner Maheu, who finds him somewhere to stay and gets him a job pushing the carts down the pit.\nA picture of the title page from an 1885 German edition\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne is portrayed as a hard-working idealist but also a naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve youth; Zola's genetic theories come into play as ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne is presumed to have inherited his Macquart ancestors' traits of hotheaded impulsiveness and an addictive personality capable of exploding into rage under the influence of drink or strong passions. Zola keeps his theorizing in the background and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne's motivations are much more natural as a result. He embraces socialist principles, reading large amounts of working class movement literature and fraternizing with Souvarine, a Russian anarchist and political ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©migrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© who has also come to Montsou to seek a living in the pits. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne's simplistic understanding of socialist politics and their rousing effect on him are very reminiscent of the rebel SilvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re in the first novel in the cycle, La Fortune des Rougon (1871).\n\nWhile this is going on, ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne also falls for Maheu's daughter Catherine, also employed pushing carts in the mines, and he is drawn into the relationship between her and her brutish lover Chaval, a prototype for the character of Buteau in Zola's later novel La Terre (1887). The complex tangle of the miners' lives is played out against a backdrop of severe poverty and oppression, as their working and living conditions continue to worsen throughout the novel; eventually, pushed to breaking point, the miners decide to strike and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne, now a respected member of the community and recognized as a political idealist, becomes the leader of the movement. While the anarchist Souvarine preaches violent action, the miners and their families hold back, their poverty becoming ever more disastrous, until they are sparked into a ferocious riot, the violence of which is described in explicit terms by Zola, as well as providing some of the novelist's best and most evocative crowd scenes. The rioters are eventually confronted by police and the army, who repress the revolt in a violent and unforgettable episode. Disillusioned, the miners go back to work, blaming ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne for the failure of the strike; then, in a fit of anarchist fervour, Souvarine sabotages the entrance shaft of one of the Montsou pits, trapping ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne, Catherine and Chaval at the bottom. The ensuing drama and the long wait for rescue are among some of Zola's best scenes, and the novel draws to a dramatic close. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tienne is eventually rescued and fired but he goes on to live in Paris with Pluchart.\n\nThe title, Germinal, is drawn from the springtime seventh month of the French Revolutionary Calendar, and is meant to evoke imagery of germination, new growth and fertility. Accordingly, Zola ends the novel on a note of hope, and one which has provided inspiration to socialist and reformist causes of all kinds throughout the years since its first publication:\n\n&quot;Beneath the blazing of the sun, in that morning of new growth, the countryside rang with song, as its belly swelled with a black and avenging army of men, germinating slowly in its furrows, growing upwards in readiness for harvests to come, until one day soon their ripening would burst open the earth itself.&quot;\n\nBy the time of his death, the novel had come to be recognized as his undisputed masterpiece. At his funeral crowds of workers gathered, cheering the cortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ge with shouts of &quot;Germinal! Germinal!&quot;. Since then the book has come to symbolize working class causes and to this day retains a special place in French mining-town folklore.\n\nZola was always very proud of Germinal, and was always keen to defend its accuracy against accusations of hyperbole and exaggeration (from the conservatives) or of slander against the working classes (from the socialists). His research had been typically thorough, especially the parts involving lengthy observational visits to northern French mining towns in 1884, such as witnessing the after-effects of a crippling miners' strike first-hand at Anzin or actually going down a working coal pit at Denain. The mine scenes are especially vivid and haunting as a result.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e556ee093c764e486b054adace1545bdc2329f","amp;dn":"Germinal+by+Emile+Zola","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e556ee093c764e486b054adace1545bdc2329f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,229,86,238,9,60,118,78,72,107,5,74,218,206,21,69,189,194,50,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
