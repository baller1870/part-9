But now he needs help from the Doctor, Romana and K9. When he left Gallifrey he took with him a few little souvenirs - most of them are harmless. But one of them is extremely dangerous.\n\nThe Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey isn't a book for Time Tots. It is one of the Artefacts, dating from the dark days of Rassilon. It must not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. The sinister Skagra most definitely has the wrong hands. He wants the book. He wants to discover the truth behind Shada. And he wants the Doctor's mind...\n\nBased on the scripts for the original television series by the legendary Douglas Adams, Shada retells an adventure that never made it to the screen.\n\nThis epic 'lost' adventure from 1979 features the Fourth Doctor and Romana as played by Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, written by Doctor Who's then script editor Douglas Adams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:220043829686f57b1f09b7a6221b75724ae7fdf9","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Shada+-+Douglas+Adams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"220043829686f57b1f09b7a6221b75724ae7fdf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,0,67,130,150,134,245,123,31,9,183,166,34,27,117,114,74,231,253,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
