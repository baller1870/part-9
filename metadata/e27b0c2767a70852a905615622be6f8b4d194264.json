First published in 1924, the story has been frequently anthologized as a classic example of a suspenseful narrative loaded with action. Connell's story raises questions about the nature of violence and cruelty and the ethics of hunting for sport.\n\n&quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; gained favorable recognition upon its initial publication in 1924, winning the prestigious O. Henry Memorial Award for short fiction. Its popularity was further established when the first film version of the story was produced in 1932. Alternately known as The Most Dangerous Game and The Hounds of Zaroff, the film tampered notably with Connell's plot, particularly in the introduction of a female character. The story's theme, that of the hunter becoming the hunted, has become a popular one in other books and films since Connell's version appeared.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27b0c2767a70852a905615622be6f8b4d194264","amp;dn":"The+Most+Dangerous+Game+by+Richard+Connell+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27b0c2767a70852a905615622be6f8b4d194264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,123,12,39,103,167,8,82,169,5,97,86,34,190,111,139,77,25,66,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
