Thanks!\nI personally will try to seed as long as possible!\n================================\nArtist/Album Info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================================\nThis is a 4 side (A, B, C, D) FLAC vinyl recording of Daft Punk - Random Access Memories\n\nSpecs:\n\n2566 KBit/s\nSample Rate of 96000 Hz\nStereo (of course)\nflac 24 bit depth\n\nI recorded this to share, not for convenience. What I mean is there are 4 sides to this album, thus I recorded 4 total times = 4 tracks. If you want to separate the tracks into individual songs then please do so.\n\nI used Audacity, a free open source audio editor. It's pretty basic but good for this sort of thing.\n\nBrand new records and needle were used. This is literally the third play of these records. And I tried to keep all impurities off the records and needle.\n\nTurntable used was a Realistic LAB-500 Fully Automatic Direct Drive connected directly to stereo inputs of my computer. I monitored (listened) to it as it played, so I could hear any problems. \n\nOverall I'd say really good quality, but there may be one or two small pops on this set which only occur once or twice on the whole set.\n\n================================\n\nTrack list for this album:\n\nSide A:\n1. Give Life Back to Music\n2. The Game of Love\n3. Giorgio by Moroder\n\nSide B:\n1. Within\n2. Instant Crush\n3. Lose Yourself To Dance\n\nSide C:\n1. Touch\n2. Get Lucky\n3. Beyond\n\nSide D:\n1. Motherboard\n2. Fragments of Time\n3. Doin' It Right\n4. Contact\n\n================================\nEnjoy, Comment, Seed!\n================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed825456dfc0445482198bb39fbab87ad85afbce","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+-+Random+Access+Memories+-+Vinyl+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed825456dfc0445482198bb39fbab87ad85afbce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,130,84,86,223,192,68,84,130,25,139,179,159,186,184,122,216,90,251,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
