It remains the most common form of sustained arrhythmia with significant mortality, morbidity and cost to the health care system. It is the most common cause of hospital admissions among all arrhythmias. Its prevalence increases with the aging population and is often associated with many other cardiac and noncardiac conditions, most notably congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Although significant progress in understanding the epidemiology, natural history and mechanism has been made, the antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with Atrial Fibrillation is less satisfactory. \n\nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation: A Practical Approach is the perfect pocket guide for those who care for patients afflicted by Atrial Fibrillation. From the history of the condition and the subsets of patients, to therapeutic and preventive procedures, Management of Atrial Fibrillation comprehensively covers all aspects in managing this increasingly prevalent disorder. Written by leading authorities in the field with vast experience in practical medicine, the book creates a clinically orientated, evidence based &quot;fast fact&quot; type resource for cardiologists, trainees and related healthcare professionals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc43bb0db1168608f9c8690df55c78219962da2","amp;dn":"Atrial+Fibrillation+Oxford+%282015%29%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc43bb0db1168608f9c8690df55c78219962da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,196,59,176,219,17,104,96,143,156,134,144,223,85,199,130,25,150,45,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
