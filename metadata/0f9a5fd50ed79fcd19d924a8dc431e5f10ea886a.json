Series #1-4\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1hEq1iM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1hEq1iM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAuthors:  Angela Roquet\nFormats:  EPUB, MOBI, PDF, AZW3, LIT\nTags:  Literature &amp; Fiction, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy, Fantasy, Paranormal &amp; Urban\nPublisher:  Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage:  English\n\n\nOverview:\n1 - Graveyard Shift\nThe Inferno has EvolvedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Lana Harvey is a reaper, and a lousy one at that. She resides in Limbo City, the modern capital of the collective afterlives, where she likes to stick it to the man (the legendary Grim Reaper himself) by harvesting the bare minimum of souls required of her. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d much rather be hanging out with Gabriel, her favorite archangel, at Purgatory Lounge. But when a shocking promotion falls in her lap, Lana learns something that could unravel the very fabric of Eternity. If the job isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t completed, there could be some real hell to pay.\n\n2 - Pocket Full of Posies\nThe promise of peace in Limbo City is threatened once again, but this time the terrorists have a more specific target in mind: Lana Harvey. The up and coming reaper thought passing her classes at the Reaper Academy was going to be her biggest challenge, but when a rebel demon sends her apartment up in flames, she realizes that her victories from the previous year havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone so unnoticed after allÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ To make matters worse, the Afterlife Council has taken notice of Lana too. The Egyptian god Horus is blackmailing her into joining the Posy Unit so she can do an illegal side job for him, and Cindy Morningstar, LuciferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, insists that she take a two week training course with the devilishly tempting Beelzebub, much to her angelic boyfriendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chagrin.\n\n3 - For the Birds\nLana Harvey isn't just any reaper. She's the new captain of the Posy Unit, a specialty group dedicated to harvesting mass quantities of souls from natural \ndisaster sites, battlefields, and the like. The new title didn't come without a price though. Lana made some promises along the way, and now it's time to follow through... even if that means putting herself in the path of the three Fates, a fickle and mighty force to be reckoned with. The Fates run a soul recycling plant in Limbo City, and if Lana isn't careful, they just might recycle her.\n\n4 - Psychopomp\nIn war, everyone loses... Reaper Lana Harvey is finding out the hard way. When Grim's new second in command, Jenni Fang, recruits her for a special mission, the biggest victory over the rebels is tainted by a crushing and immediate reprisal. The rebels have a new general working in the shadows of Limbo City, luring gods, reapers, demons, and souls to the dark side. The Afterlife CouncilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orders to locate the new rebel base are overshadowed by a desperate and mysterious plea from Grim to find the abducted Greek god of sleep, Hypnos. Where Lana and Jenni find one, they hope to find the other. But some discoveries have a way of bringing one to their knees.\n\n\n[color=blue][b][u]Note:[/u][/b][/color]   [b][u]More than most of the books that i have uploaded / will upload i BUY and share (unless it is not stated)..\nBooks #3 and #4 were bought by me..[/u][/b]\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
