His interest in music formed when he began playing drums are the age of 10. By the age of 14 he was playing in bands, and by the age of 16 he was touring in them. He later found a different outlet for his creativity through writing lyrics and music in an acoustic duo, which eventually led to the formation of The Ready Set. During the summer of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“07, Jordan wrote a few songs and kept them to himself, as his main focus was the acoustic duo he was a part of. When the other member left to pursue a different career, Jordan decided to take the songs he had started, finish them up, and put together a Myspace page just for fun. In January of 2008, he released his first EP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSyntax and Bright LightsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which was completely written and recorded in his basement. He soon after began writing for his second release, a full-length titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTantrum CastleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, also recorded in his basement. Shortly after his high school graduation, he began touring in other bands, which made it clear to him where his heart was: The Ready Set. In July of 2008 he released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTantrum CastleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and began touring full-time as The Ready Set. His live performances have evolved greatly since his early days, changing from a two-man show with keys, vocals, and a computer, to a complete full-band show with bass, drums, and lights. Throughout multiple self-booked tours, The Ready Set has continued to prove itself as a show worth seeing as well as hearing with itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s abundant energy and emphasis on showmanship. The Ready Set will be touring nationally throughout the majority of 2009, and Jordan will be hitting the studio in March to record new material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329ad25566191c59225f04656e101448d63ac0d7","amp;dn":"The+Ready+Set+%5B2+EP%5C%27s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329ad25566191c59225f04656e101448d63ac0d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,154,210,85,102,25,28,89,34,95,4,101,110,16,20,72,214,58,192,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
