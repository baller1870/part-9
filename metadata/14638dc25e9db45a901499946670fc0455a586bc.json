Notes\n\nActress presents a sweeping, poetic\nsummation of his tastes for DJ-Kicks. His\nfirst commercially available mix-tape draws\na jagged freehand from the raw house of\nBreaker 1 2 (Greg Beato) thru to Gherkin\nJerks (Larry Heard) via his own, exclusive\n'Bird Matrix', and stacks of esoteric\nconnections between Autechre, Beneath, UR,\nShit &amp; Shine and Mark Fell, to name but a\nfew. A tour de force of the last 25 years of\nelectronic dance music, it lays bare the far\nflung coordinates of Actress' deeply skewed\nsound, whether jamming the coarse textures\nof Breaker 1 2 against the graceful lines of\nLorenzo Senni, ramping Beneath's sluggish\nswagger to a tetchy +8 or veering from\nSnakepiss's opitaed arabesque, 'Toil', into\nthe recursive psychedelia of Shit &amp; Shine\nand the tail-feathered swing of Chez N\nTrent's 'Windy City Club' evergreen. We'd\nimagine that some heads are flipped both\nways - the trad house types may struggle\nwith his oblique mixing technique, whilst\nthe reel freaks will be wowed by his &quot;give a\nf**k?&quot; attitude. Like Powell, Mumdance or\nBill Kouligas, this fella is a major\ncatalyst behind rewiring our perceptions of\nwhat's possible, what is &quot;allowed&quot; in modern\ndance/electronic music, and this mix is a\nsterling case in point.\n\n. ..
