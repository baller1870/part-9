Sweaters suspend from yokes and shoulders; vertical planes are shaped to provide fit and allow movement; necklines, sleeves, and hems are adapted for specific purposes. Stitch patterns and textures elaborate design themes, and new and unusual materials can be used to striking effect.\n\nTanis Gray has curated a collection of designs from some of today's most innovative designers, all inspired by architectural themes. From accessories based on art-nouveau ironwork to a sweater that mimics Bauhaus style to a dress based on Greek sculpture, Knitting Architecture celebrates design through history.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b57b615a103f7ced470e958cc659c761bf368b9","amp;dn":"Knitting+Architecture+-+20+Patterns+Exploring+Form+Function+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b57b615a103f7ced470e958cc659c761bf368b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,87,182,21,161,3,247,206,212,112,233,88,204,101,156,118,27,243,104,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
