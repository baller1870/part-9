The album is hit-and-miss, with \\&quot;Janitor\\&quot;, \\&quot;Anything\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Unable\\&quot; (all of which are fronted by the band\\'s female vocalist Su Tissue) being personal standouts. The whole album is a fun and obscure slice of 1981 new wave.\n\nMore about Suburban Lawns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburban_Lawns\n\nTracks :\n1 Flying Saucer Safari (Ennui/Billingsgate/McBurney) 2:12\n2 Pioneers (Ennui/Tissue/McBurney) 2:05\n3 Not Allowed (Tissue/Billingsgate) 2:16\n4 Gossip (Tissue) 2:29\n5 Intellectual Rock (McBurney) 2:05\n6 Protection (Billingsgate) 1:54\n7 Anything (Tissue) 1:38\n8 Janitor (Ennui/Tissue/Billingsgate/McBurney) 2:30\n9 Computer Date (Ennui/Billingsgate) 1:06\n10 Mom And Dad And God (Ennui/Roast) 1:56\n11 Unable (Tissue/Billingsgate) 1:31\n12 When In The World (Billingsgate) 2:48\n13 Green Eyes (Tissue) 2:53\n14 Jam The Controls (Ennui) 1:06\n\nMusicians : \nSu Tissue vocals &amp; keyboards \nJohn McBurney lead guitars &amp; vocals \nFrankie Ennui guitars &amp; vocals \nVex Billingsgate bass &amp; vocals \nChuck Roast drums\nAdditional Musician: EJ Emmons percussion, synthesizer &amp; string arrangements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9bcc84160bfaf09c19ace883a5dc31026bf084f","amp;dn":"Suburban+Lawns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9bcc84160bfaf09c19ace883a5dc31026bf084f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,188,200,65,96,191,175,9,193,154,206,136,58,93,195,16,38,191,8,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
