He was effectively replaced with Ringo Starr's son, Zak Starkey.\n\nHeathen Chemistry is the first Oasis album to have significant writing contributions from members other than chief songwriter Noel Gallagher. Front man Liam Gallagher contrubuted three songs, and new bassist Andy Bell and rhythm guitarist Gem Archer contributed one song each as well.\n\n\n\n1.  The Hindu Times   \t\n2.
