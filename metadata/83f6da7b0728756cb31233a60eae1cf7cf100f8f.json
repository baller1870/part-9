Update values realtime with Temp and Press sliders\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ User friendly with several pages of step by step instructions\n\nif the early outdoor temperature is 75F and you charge the system to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“beer can coldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suction line your system is likely improperly charged. Later in the afternoon high temperatures will increase head pressure and the resulting overcharge means a lower than desired superheat and wasted energy. Not good!\n\nFeatures:\n\nUse HVAC Buddy to enter refrigerant, temperatures, and pressures. The math is done for you to display Superheat or SubcoolingTarget, Actual, and Difference. Use temperature and pressure sliders to see what happens in realtime when these values change. HVAC Buddy contains generic charts for target Superheat and Subcool as well as pressure-temperature tables for 71 Refrigerants. Temperature data for your pressure is displayed on the refrigerant row and changes can easily be viewed by moving the pressure slider. Add or recover refrigerant to get the Actual value to within the displayed target Superheat or Subcool range.\n\nThis app does NOT have a traditional PT Chart display. However, you can view temperatures in the upper left hand corner given any vapor line pressure (Superheat tab) or Liquid leaving pressure (Subcooling tab).\n\nRecent Changes:\nVersion 1.3.2 - Added Localization for French.\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f6da7b0728756cb31233a60eae1cf7cf100f8f","amp;dn":"HVAC+Buddy+v1.3.2+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f6da7b0728756cb31233a60eae1cf7cf100f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,246,218,123,7,40,117,108,179,18,51,166,14,174,28,247,207,16,15,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
