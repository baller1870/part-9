The\nauthors highlight  how mathematical  modeling, together  with the  power of\nmathematical tools  and abstraction,  have been  crucial for  innovation in\ntechnology. The topics  are presented with clarity, and  the mathematics is\nexpressed in  a straightforward  manner. Numerous exercises  at the  end of\nevery section provide  practice and reinforce the material  in the chapter.\nAn  engaging  quality  of this  book  is  that  the  authors also  put  the\nmathematical  material in  a historical  context and  not just  a practical\none.  Mathematics and  Technology is  intended for  undergraduate students,\ninstructors and high school  teachers. Prerequisites are essentially linear\nalgebra  and  Euclidean  geometry.   Additionally,  its  lack  of  calculus\ncentricity as well  as a clear indication of the  more difficult topics and\nrelatively advanced references make it  suitable for any curious individual\nwith a decent command of high school math.\n\n&quot;This book takes a more detailed view of mathematics in action, in several areas of technology Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ . This is an excellent book for a varied audience.\nThis book will also be attractive to college students Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and to researchers in mathematics, computer science (CS), and technology, who want to acquire a more thorough understanding of the applications covered in the book. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ the authors give several pointers and suggestions to instructors. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ I like this book and I recommend it.&quot; (Edgar R.
