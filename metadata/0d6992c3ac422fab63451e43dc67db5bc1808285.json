For the most part the picture is sharper\r\nand clearer than other releases including Heavy Metal Kids.  This is not\r\na re-make of Heavy Metal Kidsâ€¦. The most noticeable improvement is with \r\nTangerine â€“ complete and sharp â€“ no cuts of any kind.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDisc 1 (EVSDVD-021):\r\n\r\n01.Introduction By Nicky Horne\r\n02.Rock And Roll \r\n03.Sick Again\r\n04.Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n05.In My Time Of Dying\r\n06.The Song Remains The Same\r\n07.The Rain Song\r\n08.Kashmir\r\n09.No Quarter\r\n10.Tangerine\r\n11.Going To California\r\n12.That's The Way\r\n13.Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\r\n\r\nDisc 2 (EVSDVD-022):\r\n\r\n01.Trampled Underfoot\r\n02.Moby Dick\r\n03.Dazed And Confused\r\n04.Stairway To Heaven\r\n05.Whole Lotta Love / The Crunge\r\n06.Black Dog\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis is a monster of a show. The best of the five Earl's Court gigs, \r\nthis show has the band reaching a peak for 1975, one that is even \r\nbetter than Seattle and LA two months earlier. Nicky Horne simply \r\nintroduced the band: &quot;Welcome to Earl's Court. For the next three \r\nhours ... your mother wouldn't like it!&quot; No Quarter must be the best \r\nversion ever recorded, and Dazed And Confused is an incredible journey. \r\nDennis Healey was again remembered during the introduction to the Dazed: \r\n&quot;We gotta fly soon. Y'know how it goes with Dennis ... dear Dennis. \r\nPrivate enterprise ... no artists in the country anymore ... he must \r\nbe dazed and confused!&quot; Stairway To Heaven contains probably the best \r\nsolo ever by Jimmy on the song while Plant's vocal is not the best. \r\nThe humour was belonged to the whole group so Bonham took the microphone \r\nas they climbed for the encores and said: &quot;I'd like to say at this point \r\nthat I think football's a load of bollocks!&quot; what caued a quick retort \r\nfrom Plant: &quot;I'd like to say that soccer's a wonderful sport, the best \r\nsport.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6992c3ac422fab63451e43dc67db5bc1808285","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Court+Of+King+James+1975.05.24+Region+Free+DVD5x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6992c3ac422fab63451e43dc67db5bc1808285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,105,146,195,172,66,47,171,99,69,30,67,220,103,219,91,193,128,130,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
