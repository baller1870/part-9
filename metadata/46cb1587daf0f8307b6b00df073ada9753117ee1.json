But with naturalist and noted bug chef David George Gordon, bug-eating is fun, exciting, and downright delicious!\n\nNow you can impress, enlighten, and entertain your family and friends with Gordon s one-of-a-kind recipes. Spice things up at the next neighborhood potluck with a big bowl of Orthopteran OrzoÃ¢â‚¬â€pasta salad with a cricket-y twist. Conquer your fear of spiders with a Deep-Fried Tarantula. And for dessert, why not try a White Chocolate and Wax Worm Cookie? (TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re so tasty, the kids will be begging for seconds!)\n\nToday, there are more reasons than ever before to explore entomophagy (that s bug-eating, by the way). It s an environmentally-friendly source of protein: Research shows that bug farming reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is exponentially more water-efficient than farming for beef, chicken, or pigs. Mail-order bugs are readily available onlineÃ¢â‚¬â€but if you re more of a DIY-type, The Eat-A-Bug Cookbook includes plenty of tips for sustainably harvesting or raising your own.\n\nFilled with anecdotes, insights, and practical how-tos, The Eat-A-Bug Cookbook is a perfect primer for anyone interested in becoming an entomological epicure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46cb1587daf0f8307b6b00df073ada9753117ee1","amp;dn":"The+Eat-a-Bug+Cookbook%2C+Revised%3A+40+Ways+to+Cook+Crickets%2C+Grass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46cb1587daf0f8307b6b00df073ada9753117ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,203,21,135,218,240,248,48,123,107,0,223,7,58,218,151,83,17,126,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
