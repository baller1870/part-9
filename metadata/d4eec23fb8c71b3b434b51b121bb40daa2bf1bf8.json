It was well worth it!\n\nI downloaded this episode from their own tracker and torrent. It was in the H.264 mp4 format which plays fine if you have your video setup correctly. But it's a pain in the ass if you don't. So I took it and converted it over to a nice avi file in XviD format (the average for TV RIPS/DVDRIP episodes) for those that don't want the H.264.\n\nEpisode Description:\n\nPursued and damaged by repeated Klingon attacks, the crew of the Enterprise must respond to the distress call from a Federation research ship. In a matter of hours the ship and crew will be consumed by a nearby star and the crew of the Enterprise will be consumed by an mysterious horror that threatens both ships as the Klingons watch and wait. Guest starring Evan Fowler and introducing Bobby Rice a Ensign Peter Kirk, nephew of the Captain. Written and Directed by David Gerrold.
