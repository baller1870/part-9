J. Reddy (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-138-029552\r\n\r\nThis book presents an overview of the technology that allows millions and millions of tons of municipal solid waste generated globally to be perceived as an asset which, after materials recovery for recycling, can be used to generate clean power, transport fuels that can substitute fossil fuels, and value-based chemicals with minimal environmental impact. It also explains how hazardous wastes and sewage sludge can be treated and disposed of without affecting human and environmental health. It does so by providing a full discussion of established thermal conversion technologies generating heat, electricity, liquid fuels and useful chemicals from solid waste. Featuring case studies describing worldwide waste-to-energy plants in successful operation, it offers highly suited supporting material for an introductory course on waste thermal conversion processes.\r\n\r\nThis text by Dr. Jayarama Reddy details the myriad technologies developed over the years to thermally process municipal solid waste (MSW) streams for power generation. It is an excellent assembly of the specifics of the numerous technologies developed and deployed for thermal conversion of MSW for power applications ranging from traditional combustion to advanced plasma and pyrolysis. [...] Engineers, designers, inventors and students would do well to closely examine and absorb the information provided to fully understand the intricacies and nuances associated with such a challenging subject as the thermal conversion of MSW for power applications. The information provided here should serve as a study guide for those interested in developing such systems to avoid the failures of the past","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2286b47aa6dc8403021bc62bb240baef541c01","amp;dn":"Energy+Recovery+from+Municipal+Solid+Waste+by+Thermal+Conversion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2286b47aa6dc8403021bc62bb240baef541c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,34,134,180,122,166,220,132,3,2,27,198,43,178,64,186,239,84,28,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
