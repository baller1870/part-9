The game is the prequel to Lost Planet: Extreme Condition and Lost Planet 2 and takes place on the same planet of E.D.N. III. The game will take a more story-driven narrative approach to the campaign similar to the first game. Unlike previous games in the series, which were developed internally by Capcom, the game will be developed externally by Spark Unlimited with Matt Sophos serving as game director, though series creator, Kenji Oguro, is still attached as franchise creative director. This follows a recent trend of Capcom games being developed by Western developers rather than internally, such as DmC: Devil May Cry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c74da6d00a5ddbff623f95a9e1cf4cf2ed215cd","amp;dn":"Lost.Planet.3.PS3-iMARS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c74da6d00a5ddbff623f95a9e1cf4cf2ed215cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,116,218,109,0,165,221,191,246,35,249,90,158,28,244,207,46,210,21,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
