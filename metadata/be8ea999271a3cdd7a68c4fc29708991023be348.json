That is, until she spends one hot night in the arms of sexy, unbridled Dare Wilde.\nShe's a girl trapped in a rigid world she desperately wants to escape, and he's an untamed artist with an attitude, hell-bent on freeing herÃ¢â‚¬â€body, mind, and soul. But Reagan's life is not her own, and Dare is not welcome in it. She can't include him in her carefully-controlled, extremely public lifestyle...and yet she cannot give him up.\nWill a shared passion for artÃ¢â‚¬â€and, increasingly, each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€be enough to keep them together? Or will it be the thing that ultimately tears them apart?\n\nOut of Control \nThis is episode 2 of a 6-episode New Adult series, is about 130 pages long, and ends on a cliffhanger. The entire series will be available in an omnibus for readers who prefer to marathon the saga at once.*\nThree years have passed since Dare Wilde walked out of Reagan McKinley's life. Three years of radio silence. Three years of regrets. \nBut she's not the same girl anymore. Now, at twenty-two, Reagan has big plans to change her life, and it all starts with a trip to Europe. Instead of heading into Harvard Law like her parents had planned, she's crossed the ocean to follow her dreams in the art world. Her dreams. For once.\nA chance meeting in Paris brings Reagan and Dare face-to-face again, but is it serendipity...or penance? A chasm of unspoken hurt stands between them, but they can't fight the passion they have for each other. And now that she's found Dare again--the one person in this world who makes her feel whole--she doesn't want to let go. Problem is, she may not have a choice.\nTwo parts. One whole.\nTogether...they're out of control.\n\nEscaped Artist\nDare Wilde is out. The McKinley family has ruined his relationship with Reagan for the last time. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in Amsterdam, staying with his rock star brother Dash, ready to move on with his life and get Ree out of his head.\nFinally, and for good. Problem is, he loves her.\nSo when fate leads Reagan to his door again, the two must decide whether their new-found love is worth the risk. Because two fractured parts canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make a whole, and they must face the demons of Reagan's past if they are to have a future together.\nA muse and her artist. A star-crossed love.\nWill the past catch up to themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or have they finally escaped?\n\n.......................................\n\n\n\nNow, \nbring me that horizon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be8ea999271a3cdd7a68c4fc29708991023be348","amp;dn":"Untamed+Series+-+Victoria+Green%2C+Jinsey+Reese+%283+Books%29+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be8ea999271a3cdd7a68c4fc29708991023be348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,142,169,153,39,26,60,221,122,104,196,252,41,112,137,145,2,59,227,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
