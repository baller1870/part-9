The audiobooks are organized in such a way that they can be read as individual works or be listened to out of sequence with no loss to their meaning. Overall I rate them very highly and would suggest them to the interested non-historian and implore the budding historian to read them since it is doubtless they will enjoy them.\n\nDurant paints each historical character has a real human being with the complexities of character we all have. While he doesn't make excuses villains of history he makes sure he humanizes each person mentioned. This is the main constant of the Story of Civilization: Durant sees civilization as a network of real people interacting. His work presents all of recorded history not as chronology and not as a sequence of events but as a progression of people.\n\n01.
