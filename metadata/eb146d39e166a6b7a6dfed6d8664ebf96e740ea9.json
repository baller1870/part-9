But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a key missing link: most businesses still connect to their service providers via old-fashioned, inflexible TDM trunks. Now, three CiscoÃ‚Â® experts show how to use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking to eliminate legacy interconnects and gain the full benefits of end-to-end VoIP.\n \nWritten for enterprise decision-makers, network architects, consultants, and service providers, this book demystifies SIP trunking technology and trends and brings unprecedented clarity to the transition from TDM to SIP interconnects.  The authors separate the true benefits of SIP trunking from the myths and help you systematically evaluate and compare service provider offerings. You will find detailed cost analyses, including guidance on identifying realistic, achievable savings.\n \nSIP Trunking also introduces essential techniques for optimizing network design and security, introduces proven best practices for implementation, and shows how to apply them through a start-to-finish case study.\n \nChristina Hattingh, member of the technical staff in the Cisco Access Routing Technology Group (ARTG), has been involved with Cisco VoIP technologies from their inception and continues to consult and deliver training in these areas. Darryl Sladden, a Cisco Senior Product Manager, has been a key architect of the Cisco Unified Border Element and the Cisco SIP Trunking strategy as well as a key contributor to the AS5000 product, and several other Cisco VoIP technologies. ATM Zakaria Swapan, Cisco ARTG member of technical staff, has been a key contributor to the Cisco SIP development, Cisco Unified Border Element, VoIP Gateway, Secure Unified Communications, Wireless Voice, QoS &amp; Call Admission Control and several other VoIP technologies.\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Discover the advanced Unified Communications solutions that SIP trunking facilitates\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Systematically plan and prepare your network for SIP trunking\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Generate effective RFPs for SIP trunking\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Ask service providers the right questions-Ã¢â‚¬â€œand make sense of their answers\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Compare SIP deployment models and assess their tradeoffs\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Address key network design issues, including security, call admission control, and call flows\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  Manage SIP/TDM interworking throughout the transition\n \nThis IP communications book is part of the Cisco PressÃ‚Â® Networking Technology Series. IP communications titles from Cisco Press help networking professionals understand voice and IP telephony technologies, plan and design converged networks, and implement network solutions for increased productivity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb146d39e166a6b7a6dfed6d8664ebf96e740ea9","amp;dn":"SIP+Trunking+by+Christina+Hattingh+%5BePub%5D-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb146d39e166a6b7a6dfed6d8664ebf96e740ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,20,109,57,225,102,166,183,166,223,237,109,134,100,235,249,110,116,14,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
