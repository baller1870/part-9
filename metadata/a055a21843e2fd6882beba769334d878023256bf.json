Strong-willed NYPD detective Jane Porter's perfectly ordered life turns upside down when a routine case unexpectedly leads her to primal and passionate Tarzan, now loose in the urban jungles of New York City. After plucking the mysterious feral man from his wild home, Tarzan's billionaire uncle, the CEO of powerful Greystoke Industries, stops at nothing to 'civilize' Tarzan in his own image. And, inexorably attracted to Tarzan's dangerous yet profoundly innocent nature, Jane wrestles with reason and instinct, civilization and savagery, her heart and her head.\n\nall 8 episodes of the 2003 TV series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a055a21843e2fd6882beba769334d878023256bf","amp;dn":"Tarzan+%282003%29+PDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a055a21843e2fd6882beba769334d878023256bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,85,162,24,67,226,253,104,130,190,186,118,147,52,216,120,2,50,86,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
