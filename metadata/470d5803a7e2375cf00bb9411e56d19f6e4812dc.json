Laws are modified, new problems occur, and administrative practices that were once accepted as gospel are challenged, modified, and in some cases, discarded. In this edition, as with the previous four editions, we have tried to provide the most current and useful information to the reader in an effort to help them deal with these dynamic forces and the ever-changing environment of police work.\n\nCollectively the three authors have been police officers, detectives, administrators, and educators for over eighty years. We have studied, practiced, researched, taught, and consulted on police administration and an inevitable by-product of these experiences is the development of certain perspectives. It is these perspectives that form the rationale for this book.\n\nThere is much new information in this book the reader will find informative and useful. For example, Chapter Two, Community Policing is a new chapter which focuses on the impact of community policing on police administration. We also discuss the expanded coverage of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS). In Chapter 3, Politics and Police Administration there is an expanded discussion on the issues of police brutality and scandal as well as discussions of militias, right-wing groups in the United States and school violence. In Chapter 8, Human Resource Management we discuss the arguments presented in favor of requiring a college education for police applicants as well as arguments presented by some groups opposing college education for police applicants. Also in this chapter we have added new material on the Administration of Discipline, Internal Affairs Units, and Retirement Counseling. In Chapter 9, Stress and Police Personnel we have expanded our discussion on police suicide and address in considerable detail the phenomenon known as Suicide by Cop (SbC), Stress and the Female Police Officer and Police Domestic Violence. In Chapter 11, Legal Aspects of Police Administration there is a feature on the now infamous New York City Abner Louima case and its impact along with a discussion of several other high profile cases that have occurred in recent years in New York City. There is also a discussion of a recent Supreme Court decision which limits liability for injuries and deaths associated with high speed police pursuit as well as an update and expanded discussion of sexual harassment in the workplace. In Chapter 12, Planning and Decision Making, we have provided updated material on the investigation of the Branch Davidian Seige in Waco, Texas, focusing on the potential coverup and misuse of military personnel during the engagement.\n\nAs with all previous editions, we have attempted to provide newspaper clippings, case studies and vignettes from our own experience. These are scattered throughout to illustrate points discussed in the narrative in order to make them more informative and interesting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470d5803a7e2375cf00bb9411e56d19f6e4812dc","amp;dn":"Police+Administration%2C+Structures%2C+Processes+and+Behaviors%2C+8E+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470d5803a7e2375cf00bb9411e56d19f6e4812dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,13,88,3,167,226,55,92,240,11,185,65,30,86,209,159,110,72,18,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
