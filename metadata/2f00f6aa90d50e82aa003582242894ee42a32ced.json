But Daniel Quinn is hiding a guilty past so dark he refuses to let anyone get close. Except thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something about gorgeous, studious Ella Abrams that goes beyond the electric attraction between themÃ¢â‚¬â€something that makes him want to open up.\n\nElla has suffered enough heartache and guilt to fill one of her psychology textbooks, but she keeps that part of herself hidden behind a bubbly exterior. Until she receives an anonymous call while working the suicide helpline and the voice on the other end touches something inside of her that she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ignore.\n\nSoon Ella and QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s physical connection heats up, even as their deep and revealing hotline talks intensify. But by the time Ella realizes that her seductive jock and her sensitive caller are the same guy, it might be too late to save himÃ¢â‚¬â€or to stop herself from falling too far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f00f6aa90d50e82aa003582242894ee42a32ced","amp;dn":"Before+You+Break+%28Between+Breaths+%232%29+by+Christina+Lee+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f00f6aa90d50e82aa003582242894ee42a32ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,0,246,170,144,213,14,130,170,0,53,130,36,40,148,238,66,163,44,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
