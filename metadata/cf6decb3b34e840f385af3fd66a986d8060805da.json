But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! Enter a\nuniverse where you must prove yourself to the resident god-like figure\nby doing its many bizarre and varied tasks. Or just ignore it and see\nhow big you can grow!\n\nSolar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract\nuniverse. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your\nplanets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play\ndestructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your\norbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems.\nFeatures:\n\nDynamic abstract sandbox universe. Changes and evolves as you do.\n\nNon-linear missions and open-world gameplay.\n\nNo boundaries. Drift forever in ambient space bliss.\n\nFull of weird eccentric humor and stuff.\n\nExtensive custom sound track.\n\n----\n\nCredit goes to Unleashed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6decb3b34e840f385af3fd66a986d8060805da","amp;dn":"Solar+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6decb3b34e840f385af3fd66a986d8060805da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,109,236,179,179,78,132,15,56,90,243,253,102,169,134,216,6,8,5,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
