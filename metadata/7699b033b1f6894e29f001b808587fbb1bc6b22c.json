For centuries, the precise workings of gravity have confounded the greatest scientific minds - from Newton to Faraday and Einstein - and the idea of controlling gravity has been seen as little more than a fanciful dream. Yet in the mid 1990s, UK defence manufacturer BAE Systems began a ground-breaking project code-named Greenglow, which set about turning science fiction into reality. On the other side of the Atlantic, Nasa was simultaneously running its own Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project. It was concerned with potential space applications of new physics, including concepts like 'faster-than-light travel' and 'warp drives'.\r\n\r\nLooking into the past and projecting into the future, Horizon explores science's long-standing obsession with the idea of gravity control. It looks at recent breakthroughs in the search for loopholes in conventional physics and examines how the groundwork carried out by Project Greenglow has helped change our understanding of the universe. Gravity control may sound like science fiction, but the research that began with Project Greenglow is very much ongoing, and the dream of flying cars and journeys to the stars no longer seems quite so distant.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 008 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 19s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 376 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 280 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7699b033b1f6894e29f001b808587fbb1bc6b22c","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2016+Project+Greenglow+The+Quest+for+Gravity+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7699b033b1f6894e29f001b808587fbb1bc6b22c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,153,176,51,177,246,137,78,41,240,1,184,8,88,127,187,27,198,178,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
