We suggest, therefore, that you follow these principles when you\nuse themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nBest interests\nEnsure that you have your own best interests and the best interests of the person\nyou are persuading at heart. If you know that what you want them to do is going\nto be good for them and make them happy / healthy / wealthy then go for it. If\nin doubt, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t! While it is possible to get people to do things against their best\ninterests, they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make the same mistake twice, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell lots of other\npeople not to either.\nBelieve in your product / service / idea\nWhether you are persuading someone of the value of your ideas, services or\nphysical products, one thing is fairly certain: if you do not believe in it, neither\nwill they. So make sure that you believe in whatever you want others to believe\nin. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, then either change your belief or change your product.\nBelieve in yourself\nIt is an old adage that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpeople buy peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and the quickest way to get others to\nbelieve in you is to believe in yourself. There are many excellent resources\navailable for developing your self-belief Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we suggest you use them.
