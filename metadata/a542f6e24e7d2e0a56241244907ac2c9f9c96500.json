He toured with the Rolling Stones and had an international hit with a duet with Mick Jagger, then toured again to equally rapturous world audiences as the headlining act. His words would cause an uproar at the One Peace concert, but then unlike fellow Wailer Bob Marley, Tosh always made his true feelings known. He was born Winston Hubert McIntosh on October 19, 1944, in the small rural village of Grange Hill, Jamaica. Like so many young island teens searching for a better life, he left home at 15 and headed for Kingston. Once there, he made his way to Joe Higgs' tenement yard, joining other aspiring youths eager for the vocal coaching lessons the singing star provided to local teens. Amongst these youthful wannabes were Bunny, Bob Marley, and the much younger Junior Braithwaite; the four, buttressed by backing vocalists Cherry Green and Beverley Kelso, joined forces initially as the Teenagers before eventually settling on the moniker the Wailers.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Get Up, Stand Up\n02.Downpresser Man\n03.I Am That I Am\n04.Stepping Razor\n05.Equal Rights\n06.African\n07.Jah Guide\n08.Apartheid\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a542f6e24e7d2e0a56241244907ac2c9f9c96500","amp;dn":"Peter+Tosh+-+Equal+Rights+%281977%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a542f6e24e7d2e0a56241244907ac2c9f9c96500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,66,246,226,78,125,46,10,86,36,18,68,144,122,194,201,249,201,101,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
