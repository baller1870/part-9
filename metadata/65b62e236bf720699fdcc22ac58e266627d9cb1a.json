Marrying what Emily calls, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A new Scottish soundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with her gorgeous voice and her ability to connect with the subjects and stories at the heart of these 10 stunning new arrangements.\n\nJoining multi-instrumentalists Jamie McClennan and Matheu Watson, bassist Ross Hamilton and percussionist Signy Jakobsdottir is an impressive guest list of Jerry Douglas, Aoife OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Donovan, Kris Drever, Tim Edey, Natalie Haas and Rory Butler. Together theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created an album with one foot planted firmly in EmilyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home of Dumfries and Galloway and the other in the unspoiled heartland of Nashville. If albums can have feet, that is.\n\nHidden amongst the traditional songs such as King Orfeo, Twa Sisters and My Darling Boy are a couple of notable covers including Darrell ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exquisite The Open Door and Bill CaddickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautifully timeless John OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Dreams. With ten years of performing behind her, we can only hazard a guess at whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in store for the next ten years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b62e236bf720699fdcc22ac58e266627d9cb1a","amp;dn":"Emily+Smith+-+Echoes+%5B2014%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b62e236bf720699fdcc22ac58e266627d9cb1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,182,46,35,107,247,32,105,159,220,194,42,197,142,38,102,39,217,203,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
