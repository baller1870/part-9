Thomas Dubay - Deep Conversion, Deep Prayer (EPUB, MOBI, PDF)\r\n\r\nFr. Thomas Dubay is one of the most popular and respected retreat masters and spiritual directors in the USA. He is the author of the perennial best-selling book on prayer and contemplation, Fire Within. In this book, he responds to the call to priests by both Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI to help believers and all those interested in spirituality to develop a deeper prayer life and union with God.\r\n\r\nAs in his other popular writings, Dubay's style is profound and meditative yet clear and readable. He gives an overview of the spiritual life and journey for anyone seeking to grow in the love of God and neighbor. An expert on the teachings and writings of the two great mystical doctors of prayer and the spiritual life, Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross, Dubay gives solid practical advice for a deepening moral and spiritual conversion, and a radical growth in holiness.\r\n\r\nTopics covered in depth in this book include:\r\n\r\n    The Radical Conversion\r\n    Relevance and Motivation\r\n    Conversion and Genuine Love\r\n    Degrees of Depth\r\n    Remarkable Resistance\r\n    Called to the Heights\r\n    Sure-fire Program\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05473c6aec4b58e3bd5141a867baab09ff007ac4","amp;dn":"Fr.+Thomas+Dubay+-+Deep+Conversion%2C+Deep+Prayer+%28EPUB+MOBI+PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05473c6aec4b58e3bd5141a867baab09ff007ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,71,60,106,236,75,88,227,189,81,65,168,103,186,171,9,255,0,122,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
