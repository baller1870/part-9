It first emerged with a five song demo and featured former Acid Bath guitarist Mike Sanchez on lead guitar. The demo includes Big Black Backwards, Ash of the Mind and other songs which would later appear on the band&amp;#039;s self-titled debut, along with 2 other songs: Riding the Wormhole and a new version of The Skeletal Circus Derails. The band&amp;#039;s debut album is a masterful blend of haunting ballads with interspersed metallic fury (though never reverting to the superheavy stylings of Acid Bath). The band only lasted a short tour in support of the album, before splitting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5825906ce9f5cb57268288957c03d0fb9b05cb","amp;dn":"The+Dax+Riggs+Collection+part+3+%28Agents+of+Oblivion%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5825906ce9f5cb57268288957c03d0fb9b05cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,88,37,144,108,233,245,203,87,38,130,136,149,124,3,208,251,155,5,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
