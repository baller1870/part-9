After wishing he had more friends, Manny finds a mysterious collar and puts it on Rufus, the family dog. Suddenly, Rufus turns into a boy! Manny's not sure what to do, so he enrolls Rufus in school. When the other students notice Rufus's silly dog antics -- chasing squirrels, eating without utensils, asking for belly rubs, and catching a soccer ball with his mouth -- he immediately becomes the most popular kid around. Manny is jealous of his new best friend but eventually learns that a dog's loyalty to his owner always comes first","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa927a05717f48a9231155dcc77ac19f5d86a70","amp;dn":"Rufus+2016+HDTV+x264-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa927a05717f48a9231155dcc77ac19f5d86a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,169,39,160,87,23,244,138,146,49,21,93,204,119,172,25,245,216,106,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
