Indeed, his vision of modern warfare powerfully influenced the United States' decision to rethink its military strategy in Iraq and implement &quot;the Surge,&quot; now recognized as a dramatic success. In Counterinsurgency, Kilcullen brings together his most salient writings on this vitally important topic. Here is a picture of modern warfare by someone who has had his boots on the ground in some of today's worst trouble spots-including Iraq and Afghanistan-and who has been studying counterinsurgency since 1985. Filled with down-to-earth, common-sense insights, this book is the definitive account of counterinsurgency, indispensable for all those interested in making sense of our world in an age of terror.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d448325c04485da84e148cd97b7c8ad57641096","amp;dn":"Counterinsurgency","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d448325c04485da84e148cd97b7c8ad57641096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,68,131,37,192,68,133,218,132,225,72,205,151,183,200,173,87,100,16,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
