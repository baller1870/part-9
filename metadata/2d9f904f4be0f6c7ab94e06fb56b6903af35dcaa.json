TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fast becoming legends in the history of London nightlife, and are now setting their sights on taking over the world.\nOperating on so many levels of amazing, Horse Meat Disco is the joint to head to, whatever the angle of your dangle. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sublime place where the cosmic, the hairy, the naked and downright fabulous can be free and far out. Their NYC Downlow events are fast becoming highlights of both Glastonbury and Lovebox, too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ imagine something akin to the movie Cruising (minus the stabbings, natch) featuring an alley filled with trannies, hookers and leather boys in a generally debauched atmosphere. It's fair to say itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slightly more alluring than watching Scouting For Girls in the drizzle.\n\nNow, finally, the good boys of HMD have released their first proper compilation. Filled with the essence of what makes a memorable night out, the mix encapsulates the finest crate-dug gems of 70s/80s disco. Anyone with a taste for the lesser-known names of the Casablanca and TK stables, and acts such as Gino Soccio, Karen Young and Fern Kinney will be absolutely enraptured. Highlights in a boogie-friendly collection of thrills include a rare-as-hens-teeth Larry Levan dub mix of Smokey Robinson's And I Don't Love You; Two Tons O' FunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I Depend On You (the group later became The Weather Girls); and the tremendous, floor-destroying anthem In The Evening by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThrow in possibly the greatest introduction to a mix album ever Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoil the surprise Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and you have something quite magical that can turn any occasion, however mundane, into a polysexual cosmic disco wonderland. --Ian Wade&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d9f904f4be0f6c7ab94e06fb56b6903af35dcaa","amp;dn":"VA+-+Horse+Meat+Disco%2C+Vol.+1-4+%28MP3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d9f904f4be0f6c7ab94e06fb56b6903af35dcaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,159,144,79,75,224,246,199,171,148,224,111,181,107,105,3,175,53,220,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
