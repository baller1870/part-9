The DVD rip (for some reason) goes back to using the censored version from the original telecast.\n\nHelter Skelter is a 1976 TV film based on the 1974 book by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry. In the United States, it aired over two nights. In some countries it was shown in theaters with additional footage (nudity, language and more violence).\n\nThe movie is based upon the murders committed by the Charles Manson Family. The best-known victim was actress Sharon Tate. The title was taken from the Beatles' song of the same name. According to the theory put forward by the prosecution, Manson used the term for an anticipated race war, and &quot;healter skelter&quot; [sic] was scrawled in blood on the refrigerator door at the house of one of the victims. It recounts the murders Manson committed, the investigation, and the 1970-71 trial where prosecuting D.A. Bugliosi attempted to draw connections between the Manson family and his violent convictions.\n\nThe 1976 film, directed by Tom Gries, stars Steve Railsback as Manson and George DiCenzo as Bugliosi. Writer JP Miller received a 1977 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best TV Feature or MiniSeries Teleplay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a18639ba7ae8ce24d49f171ec2a9af3563503c","amp;dn":"Helter+Skelter+%281976%29+Charles+Manson+Story+-+.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5a18639ba7ae8ce24d49f171ec2a9af3563503c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,161,134,57,186,122,232,206,36,212,159,23,30,194,169,175,53,99,80,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
