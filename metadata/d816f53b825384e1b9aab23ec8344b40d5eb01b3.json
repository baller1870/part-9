Limited Liability Company; 1 edition (April 15, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0615775373\nISBN-13: 978-0615775371\n\nHow did a 75-year old actor from Star Trek become a social media juggernaut? Why does everything he posts spread like wildfire across the ether, with tens or even hundreds of thousands of likes and shares? And what can other sites, celebrities and companies do to attain his stratospheric engagement levels, which hover or top 100 percent while theirs languish in the single digits? Read about George TakeiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meteoric rise and dominance of the Internet in Oh Myyy (There Goes the Internet). In this groundbreaking, hilarious and informative book, Takei recounts his experiences on platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, where fans and pundits alike have crowned him King. He muses about everything from the nature of viral sharing, to the taming of Internet trolls, to why Yoda, bacon and cats are such popular memes. Takei isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to tell it likes he sees it, and to engage the reader just as he does his legions of fans. Both provokingly thoughtful and wickedly funny, Oh Myyy! captures and comments upon the quirky nature of our plugged-in culture. With TakeiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversational yet authoritative style, peppered with some of his favorite images from the web, readers should be prepared to LOL, even as they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but hear his words in their heads in that unmistakable, deep bass.\n\nAbout the Author\nGeorge Hosato Takei (April 20, 1937) is an American actor and author, best known for his role as Hikaru Sulu, helmsman of the USS Enterprise in the television series Star Trek.
