It is a call-in and variety show hosted by Chris Gethard that airs every Wednesday night at 11:00PM on MNN and on a live stream at the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website. \n\nThe Public access television show is written and produced by Noah Forman, Dru Johnston, J.D. Amato and Chris Gethard. It is directed by J.D. Amato. The show, known for its &quot;no cool kids&quot; atmosphere, has been called &quot;oddly uplifting&quot;, a &quot;cult hit,&quot; &quot;an often riveting experiment in seat-of-your-pants broadcasting,&quot; and has gained viewers from around the world. \n\nOn November 20, 2013, it was announced that Comedy Central had ordered a pilot for prospective addition to their lineup.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chris_Gethard_Show&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chris_Gethard_Show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thechrisgethardshow.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thechrisgethardshow.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOriginally shared by rpycroft.\n\n\n\nSeed and Share Culture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2b427b773189faec449aa56c438aaa52518962","amp;dn":"The+Chris+Gethard+Show+-+Episodes+1+-+120+%2B+Specials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2b427b773189faec449aa56c438aaa52518962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,43,66,123,119,49,137,250,236,68,154,165,108,67,138,170,82,81,137,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
