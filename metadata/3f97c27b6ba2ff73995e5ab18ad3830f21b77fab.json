The text that is translated is called the source text, and the language that it is translated into is called the target language. The product is sometimes called the target text.\n\nTranslation, when practiced by relatively bilingual individuals but especially when by persons with limited proficiency in one or both languages, involves a risk of spilling-over of idioms and usages from the source language into the target language. On the other hand, inter-linguistic spillages have also served the useful purpose of importing calques and loanwords from a source language into a target language that had previously lacked a concept or a convenient expression for the concept. Translators and interpreters have thus played an important role in the evolution of languages and cultures\n\n\n[/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/ce2Zat5.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/5ab1/9c50852d.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f97c27b6ba2ff73995e5ab18ad3830f21b77fab","amp;dn":"7+Books+Of+Translation+%28PDF%2CDoc%29+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f97c27b6ba2ff73995e5ab18ad3830f21b77fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,151,194,123,107,162,255,115,153,94,90,177,138,211,131,15,33,183,127,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
