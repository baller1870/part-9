The band formed in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, and was originally composed of four women performing bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years, without attracting a major label. After the departure of one bandmate, the replacement of their lead singer, and a slight change in their repertoire, the Dixie Chicks achieved massive country music and pop success, beginning in 1998 with hit songs like &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot;, and &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;. The women also became well-known for their independent spirit and controversial comments on subjects such as war and politics.\n\nDuring a London concert ten days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, lead vocalist Maines said, &quot;we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States (George W. Bush) is from Texas&quot; (the Dixie Chicks' home state).[1] The statement offended some people, who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the band half of their concert audience attendance in the United States and led to accusations of the three women being &quot;un-American&quot;, as well as hate mail, a death threat, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.[2] The controversy and condemnation of the Dixie Chicks partially dissipated when Bush became unpopular among Americans.\n\nAs of 2009, they have won 13 Grammy Awards, with 5 of them earned in 2007 including the coveted Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Taking The Long Way. As of July 2010, with 30.5 million certified albums,[3] and sales of 26,733,000 albums in the U.S., they have become the top selling country female band in the U.S. during the Nielsen SoundScan era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential 2010\n\n\nThe Essential Dixie Chicks is a Greatest Hits album from American country band the Dixie Chicks. The album consists of 2 discs containing 30 songs spanning over the 13 year career of the Dixie Chicks.[1] The album is a part of the The Essential series. The album was released in countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand on August 24, 2010 and will be released in the United States on October 26.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot;\n2.\t&quot;The Long Way Around&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Easy Silence&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Lubbock or Leave It&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Bitter End&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Silent House&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Lullaby&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Everybody Knows&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Long Time Gone&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Travelin' Soldier&quot;\n11.\t&quot;Landslide&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Lil' Jack Slade&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Truth No. 2&quot;\n14.\t&quot;White Trash Wedding&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Top of the World&quot;\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Ready to Run&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Some Days You Gotta Dance&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Heartbreak Town&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Sin Wagon&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Without You&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Let Him Fly&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;\n10.\t&quot;There's Your Trouble&quot;\n11.\t&quot;You Were Mine&quot;\n12.\t&quot;I Can Love You Better&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Tonight the Heartache's on Me&quot;\n14.\t&quot;Give It Up or Let Me Go&quot;\n15.\t&quot;I Believe in Love&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy Dixie Chicks :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3222511125d8d89cd4323154ad973bda5b6054fa","amp;dn":"Dixie+Chicks+-+The+Essential+%282+CD%29+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3222511125d8d89cd4323154ad973bda5b6054fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,34,81,17,37,216,216,156,212,50,49,84,173,151,59,218,91,96,84,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
