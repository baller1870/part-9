Finally tracked down and killed in 1992 after a 15-month intense manhunt that had resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides, Escobar was, ironically, that archetypal American hero, the outlaw, siding with &quot;ordinary people&quot; against the ruling oligarchy (although at his peak Forbes magazine listed him as the seventh-richest person in the world). His break came when the American drug of choice changed from dope to cocaine, a golden, or perhaps powdered, egg exploited by Escobar with resourceful manipulation of officials and politicians--he would offer the classic choice of his silver or his lead. Even when incarcerated at La Catedral prison on a smuggling charge, he turned it into a state within a state. The guards, the army and the police all fell within his pay and he led his operation with a quiet, well-mannered ruthlessness. Until, that is, the Americans took an interest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73d43ae0dab6c3dc179aad5be83662a76f9e454f","amp;dn":"Mark+Bowden+-+Killing+Pablo+%28mobi+%2B+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73d43ae0dab6c3dc179aad5be83662a76f9e454f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,212,58,224,218,182,195,220,23,154,173,91,232,54,98,167,111,158,69,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
