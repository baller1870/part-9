A menu can tell you about the farm-sourced ingredients. Now who's going to tell you about the people preparing your meal? \r\n\r\nFrom James Beard Leadership Award winner Saru Jayaraman, Forked is an enlightening examination of what we don't talk about when we talk about restaurants: Is the line cook working through a case of stomach flu because he doesn't get paid sick days? Is the busser not being promoted because he speaks with an accent? Is the server tolerating sexual harassment because tips are her only income? \r\n\r\nAs most corporate restaurants continue to set low standards for worker wages and benefits, a new class of chefs and restaurateurs is working to foster sustainability in their food and their employees. Forked offers an insider's view of the highestâ€•and lowestâ€•scoring restaurants for worker pay and benefits in each sector of the restaurant industry, and with it, a new way of thinking about how and where we eat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55a67d7af5971f7bd53650344e8597fb2f1988e3","amp;dn":"Forked+-+A+New+Standard+for+American+Dining+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55a67d7af5971f7bd53650344e8597fb2f1988e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,166,125,122,245,151,31,123,213,54,80,52,78,133,151,251,47,25,136,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
