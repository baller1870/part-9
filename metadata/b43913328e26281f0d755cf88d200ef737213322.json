They&amp;#039;re wacky, their intentions are absurdly comedic and their eyes pop out when ever they see a cute girl passing by; well maybe not quite. But one thing for sure is that The Vandals are way past their angst filled &quot;Suburbia&quot; days; now they just want to make people laugh with their upteenth album &quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good.&quot; Normally, when a punk band -or any band in general- tries to be funny and musically inclined at the same time, they only succeed in one out of the two efforts. Surprisingly, The Vandals have a nice balance of both with songs like &quot;My Girlfriend&amp;#039;s Dead,&quot; with lyrics that go: &quot;My girlfriend&amp;#039;s dead you see, it&amp;#039;s a total lie- but it&amp;#039;s easier on me than having to admit that she likes someone else.&quot; Then there&amp;#039;s &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got An Ape Drape,&quot; which throws out a plethora of adjectives for the short on top long on back haircut: &quot;Hockey Hair, Mullet, Norco Neck Warmer, &quot; et cetra. And to top it off on a serious note, there&amp;#039;s even a nice dedication to former Pennywise bassist Jason Matthew Thirsk who committed suicide a year prior to this release.\n\nEnjoy! :) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43913328e26281f0d755cf88d200ef737213322","amp;dn":"The+Vandals+-+Hitler+Bad%2C+Vandals+Good","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43913328e26281f0d755cf88d200ef737213322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,57,19,50,142,38,40,31,13,117,92,248,141,32,14,247,55,33,51,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
