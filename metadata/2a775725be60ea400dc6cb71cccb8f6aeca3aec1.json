R E L E A S E   N O T E S                   ?????\n ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n      Synthesis\n       \n      Drumazon synthesis emulates all the sounds of the original\n      9O9. All the instruments are synthesized in exactly the same\n      way as the original. All the nuances and detail of the\n      original are captured perfectly. In addition, all Drumazon\n      instruments have enhanced controls. This extra functionality\n      allows the user to adjust the sounds further than on the\n      original unit. This opens up a whole new world of sound\n      creation. Listen to the audio demos or tweak it yourself with\n      the demo version :)\n       \n      Outputs\n       \n      Drumazon has a flexible output configuration. Every\n      instrument&amp;#039;s audio signal can be routed to any of the 11\n      outputs. This allows users to further shape sounds\n      individually or in groups via their favourite plug-ins.\n      Each individual output can be set to mono or stereo. Every\n      instrument also has a Mute and Solo button. Mute will not just\n      silence the sound, it will stop the sound being triggered.\n      Solo will stop all other instruments from being triggered and\n      only allow the selected sound(s) to play.\n       \n      Control\n       \n      Drumazon has extensive midi control. Midi notes can be used to\n      trigger each individual sound. Alternatively, the internal\n      sequencer can be used. This can be set to play using\n      Drumazon&amp;#039;s internal clock or set to synchronize perfectly to\n      the host sequencer.\n       \n      Most of Drumazon&amp;#039;s parameters can be automated within the host\n      and also controlled using MidiCC with an external controller.\n      An easy-to-use Midi Learn function allows reassignment of any\n      of the parameters.\n       \n      Internal Sequencer\n       \n      Within the internal sequencer, patterns are stored in 8 banks.\n      Each bank can store up to 12 patterns. Each pattern consists\n      of 16 steps. Each pattern location has a midi note number\n      assigned to it. The patterns can be edited traditionally using\n      the step buttons or using the tap function.\n       \n      The internal sequencer has various modes of operation. In\n      Chain Mode, a range of patterns are selected from the internal\n      banks and are played through in a circular fashion. Patterns\n      can also be triggered freely by selecting the corresponding\n      midi note (for example, from a midi controller keyboard).\n      External controllers can be used in any mode to provide full\n      control over pattern playback.\n       \n      A Randomizer function is also provided within the internal\n      sequencer. It can be used to make simple changes to a pattern\n      or create a whole new one - ideal when your creativity needs a\n      boost! Randomizing can be applied to specific instruments and\n      specific steps. The frequency of occurrence can also be\n      adjusted to give you just the right amount.\n       \n      Files are stored in the XML format. This allows single\n      patterns or whole banks to be exchanged between users easily.\n      XML allows the files to be edited in a text editor. Ideal if\n      you want to post or share a pattern on a web site -just post\n      the text!\n       \n      Presets\n       \n      The settings for each instrument can be stored in it&amp;#039;s own\n      preset. Each instrument preset can be loaded in individually.\n      This allows maximum flexibility when putting kits of\n      instruments together. A dedicated Preset Manager is provided\n      to help the user manage the sounds within their own unique\n      library.\n       \n      Requirements\n       \n      Drumazon is available in VSTi format at the moment for both\n      platforms (PC and Mac).\n      It&amp;#039;s a dynamic library (.dll file) for PC and Universal Binary\n      bundle for Mac.\n      To use the product you need Windows 2000/XP or Mac OS X 10.4.3\n      or later. It&amp;#039;s not a standalone program so you need a VST\n      compatible host application to use it.\n      If you have not checked it yet try the demo first with your\n      favourite host and environment.\n       \n      Full Features\n       \n          * truly emulated instruments&amp;#039; synthesis\n          * perfectly scaled knob ranges with few modifications\n            enlarging spectrum of the sounds\n          * exhanced control of instruments&amp;#039; sound\n          * dynamic signal routing from instruments to outputs\n          * user defined plugin outputs settings\n          * mutes/solos for each instrument (affect triggerring not\n            just the signal)\n          * fully controllable via MidiCC\n          * quick midiCC assignation with MidiLearn function\n          * many ways of controlling the device:\n                o external mode (note mode)\n                o internal sequencer (pattern mode) with 3 submodes\n          * external mode:\n                o midi map equivalent with the classic drum\n                  machine&amp;#039;s map\n                o midi tune and velocity controls instruments&amp;#039;\n                  levels and tunes\n          * internal sequencer:\n                o 8 banks with 12 patterns per bank\n                o each pattern up to 16 steps of length\n                o each pattern defined with one of four available\n                  measures\n                o each step can be defined normal or flamed and\n                  accented or not\n                o shuffle mode\n                o flam mode\n                o tap mode\n                o chain mode\n                o Shuffle, Flam and TotalAccent values defined\n                  globally and per pattern\n                o Scale function and intelligent Rescale\n                  (automatically stretches pattern to the chosen\n                  measure)\n                o built in Randomizer (selection of instruments to\n                  random, steps to be affected, frequency of the\n                  randomized notes and more)\n                o patterns import/export via human readable xml\n                  files\n          * two modes of synchronization:\n                o precise synchronization to the host tempo\n                o synchronization to internal clock - tempo\n                  controlled in the range 30-303 BPM (+-0.1)\n          * individual presets per instrument with preset manager to\n            easy control\n\n\n ?   ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????   ?\n ?????
