Burnside  My Black Name A-Ringin'\nReleased:  1999\nLabel: Genes Records\nFormat:Mp3@320\n\n\nIn the '90s Burnside emerged as one of the most authentic and powerful blues artists in the world, gaining international recognition as a flagship artist of the raw, &quot;real&quot; blues label Fat Possum. His fierce electric sound was full of fire and fury, accompanied by bashing drums and frenetic slide guitar. 'Twas not always thus, however. My Black Name A-Ringin' contains material from one of Burside's earliest sessions (1969), when he was still an acoustic artist, pounding out unamplified versions of tunes by his heroes Muddy Waters and Lightnin' Hopkins, his style a mixture of the two (in a typical example of confusing blues proprietorship, Hopkins' &quot;Last Night Blues&quot; is listed as &quot;Sat Down on My Bed and Cried,&quot; credited to Burnside).\n\nBurnside was already in his 40s in 1969, with plenty of hard living behind him. Consequently, these early recordings expose a voice full of experience and hard-learned lessons. this is far more focused and intense than the other pre-Fat Possum Burnside releases. Despite the acoustic setting, it's closer in spirit to Burnside's astounding '90s electric recordings.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Going Down South\n02. Two Trains Runnin'\n03.
