The footage was meant for a PBS segment set to air in March of that year. Ellison allowed Nelson to repeatedly film and interview him over subsequent years, stating that he thought Nelson to be &quot;a fan working on a student project&quot;, and has stated that he never suspected that the film would amount to a serious production on such a professional level.\n\nThe result of those sessions, and subsequent sessions spanning decades from the original, have been culled and edited, with additions from contemporaries of Ellison into what has become a documentary following a rough arc of EllisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and activities.\n\nDreams with Sharp Teeth received its first public screening Thursday, April 19, 2007 at the Writers Guild Theatre in Los Angeles. [1]\n\nThe film's screenings have been met with critical acclaim by contemporaries of Ellison and Nelson, and the production company is currently searching for distribution to bring it to a larger audience.\n\nThe DVD version was released on May 26, 2009. Additional materials on the DVD include a short feature on the film's debut screening, a conversation over pizza between Ellison and Gaiman, and readings of extracts from a number of short stories.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241387de7c457524a3e4f610a7297f3f16af5fe7","amp;dn":"Dreams+with+Sharp+Teeth+%5B2008%5D+Erik+Nelson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241387de7c457524a3e4f610a7297f3f16af5fe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,19,135,222,124,69,117,36,163,228,246,16,167,41,127,63,22,175,95,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
