A major section of this book is largely devoted to chapters outlining and applying analytic methods needed for studies of nanocomposites. As such, this book will serve as good resource for such analytic methods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cca8ab564f4ceb6b6aed783d95440abefeebc90","amp;dn":"Nanocomposites+with+Unique+Properties+and+Applications+in+Medici","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cca8ab564f4ceb6b6aed783d95440abefeebc90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,202,138,181,100,244,206,182,182,174,215,131,217,84,64,171,239,238,188,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
