Aerodynamics of an Airfoil and a Wing \n\nby \n\nN. F. Krasnov\n\nThe present textbook, in addition to the general laws of flow of a\nfluid, treats the application of aerodynamics, chiefly in rocketry and\nmodern hi-speed aviation. The book consists of two parts, each forming\na separate volume.  The first of them concerns the fundamental\nconcepts and definitions of aerodynamirs and the theory of flow over\nan airfoil and a wing, including an unsteady  flow (Chapters\n1-9), while the second describes the aerodynamic design of craft\nand their individual parts (Chapters 10-15). The two parts are\ndesigned for use in a two semester course of aerodynamics, although\nthe first part can be used  independently by those interested in\nindividual problems of theoretical aerodynamics.\n\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by G. Leib. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  PDF| 9.9 MB | Pages: 513 | OCR \n\n  You can get the book here and here.\n  For magnet / torrent links go here.\n  Password if needed: mirtitles\n  Facing problems while extracting?
