Metzler (AP, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nBiochemistry: The Chemical Reactions of Living Cells is a well-integrated, up-to-date reference for basic chemistry and underlying biological phenomena. Biochemistry is a comprehensive account of the chemical basis of life, describing the amazingly complex structures of the compounds that make up cells, the forces that hold them together, and the chemical reactions that allow for recognition, signaling, and movement. This book contains information on the human body, its genome, and the action of muscles, eyes, and the brain. \r\n\r\n* Thousands of literature references provide introduction to current research as well as historical background\r\n* Contains twice the number of chapters of the first edition\r\n* Each chapter contains boxes of information on topics of general interest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3346968b1d8b1cfc6659ee938b197d6469226c7d","amp;dn":"Biochemistry+-+The+Chemical+Reactions+of+Living+Cells+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3346968b1d8b1cfc6659ee938b197d6469226c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,70,150,139,29,139,28,252,102,89,238,147,139,25,125,100,105,34,108,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
