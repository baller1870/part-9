They show with examples that mathematics is a key tool in the creation and appreciation of art, music, and literature, not just science and technology. The book covers basic mathematical topics from logarithms to statistics, but the authors eschew mundane finance and probability problems. Instead, they explain how modular arithmetic helps keep our online transactions safe, how logarithms justify the twelve-tone scale commonly used in music, and how transmissions by deep space probes are similar to knights serving as messengers for their traveling prince. Ideal for coursework in introductory mathematics and requiring no knowledge of calculus, Khare and LachowskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enlightening mathematics tour will appeal to a wide audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:453fb219ff4389e7fb7bc3d6aceedc55466b68d4","amp;dn":"Beautiful%2C+Simple%2C+Exact%2C+Crazy%3A+Mathematics+in+the+Real+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"453fb219ff4389e7fb7bc3d6aceedc55466b68d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,63,178,25,255,67,137,231,251,123,195,214,172,238,220,85,70,107,104,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
