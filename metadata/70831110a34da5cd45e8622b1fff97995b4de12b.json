Formats include PDF, TXT, DOC and RTF.\nThe novels are sorted in a (nearly) chronological structure Pre-Cataclysm, Alt-Cataclysm, 2nd Cataclysm, Anthologies and Misc.\n\nI don't list the titles here (blame my laziness), but if you have time, please do it in a comment. Also, if you know where to find any of the books I didn't include, please let me know. I'll seed to at least a 10 ratio, probably longer. Follow me!
