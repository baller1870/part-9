He has it all - but love. When alone, he sits at a desk, sighing, and looking at a photograph of a pretty girl. One day, the circus descended onto his palace, and amidst all the fun it brought, he recognized the Amazon on the white horse - the girl in the photograph. The girl is now the mother of a small boy, Yo-Yo, whom she considers that looks like the millionaire, even under a clown's make-up. The boy will spend some time in the palace, in awe of so much riches, but he will leave (in a dream-like scene) on the tusks of the elephant. Time passes - and one day Yo-Yo will be the owner of his father's palace in decay. Starting from scratch, he will rebuilt it, and be praised as a great clown, an artist, a film-maker, a millionaire. Yet, something is amiss... \n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : Yoyo.1965.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 140 Kbps\nLength            : 4.90 GiB for 1h 38mn 15s 40ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1196 x 720 (1.661) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059934/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059934/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: French\nSubtitles: English (in mkv) Portuguese (srt)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img839/4996/3tn3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img839/4996/3tn3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/4739/kckr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/4739/kckr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/4073/0auf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img844/4073/0auf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img835/5030/dsmn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img835/5030/dsmn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b10fae9bfbd8db7f23ce6ebd183e02e08d09344","amp;dn":"Yoyo.1965.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b10fae9bfbd8db7f23ce6ebd183e02e08d09344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,16,250,233,191,189,141,183,242,60,230,235,209,131,224,46,8,208,147,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
