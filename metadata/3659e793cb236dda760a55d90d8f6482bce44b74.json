Not really sure these guys can pull off a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD. One hit wonders? Not sure. But if you like their style grab some.\n\n- Big Papi\n\nBy barry VINE VOICE\nMost know Player from their late 70s megahit BABY COME BACK. Many consider this group a one hit wonder. They did have another minor hit in THIS TIME I'M IN IT FOR LOVE which was just as good as the first. The 70s and 80s were a difficult time for musical artists and groups for no matter how great their albums were whether studios would continue to release their work relied solely on the performance of their singles. There were many artists during this period who had one or two great hits and when the third attempt misfired their studio would automatically put them on the back burner till they slowly disappeared. This was very sad for many excellent artists were denied showing their true potential. Luckily today careers are not based only on singles. Thus we have many more varied artists able to succceed.\n\nPlayer had 3 albums from the late 70s and early 80s to their attempted resurrection in the mid 90s. This BEST OF collection truly shows that even though only the first two tracks were true hits they were a group with great potential. If you liked their two hits then you will love the collection. Tracks are taken from their five releases and theire is not a miss here. They have experimental pop as in PRISONER OF YOUR LOVE and BEAUTIFUL LOVE and their true romantic ballads are all extremely well executed. They don't follow a simple repetetive formula as many groups did. Instead each is lush, broad, expressive and beautiful in its own right. GIVIN IT ALL, IT'S FOR YOU and WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW are perfect examples. IF LOOKS COULD KILL and SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID are great pop songs. All the tracks here stand the test of time and are in no way dated. This says a lot for music from this time period.\n\nFor superb pop music and lush, lovely ballads you can't go wrong than THE BEST OF PLAYER. And it is also superb as a sign that quality music did come from this period. I wish they had been given more of a shot. Very underrated. A group definitely worth adding to your music collection. And the digital remastering is superb and provides excellent sound. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlayer - Baby Come Back: The Best of Player\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Player\nAlbum................: Baby Come Back: The Best of Player\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998 11 17\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 64 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nT\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
