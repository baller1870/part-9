There are zombies in the razor wire...\n\nHorror comics creators NAT JONES, MARK KIDWELL and JAY FOTOS return to the jungles of Vietnam, expanding the zombie epic started in the original one-shot '68 with this four-issue mini-series of undead military horror.\n\nEach issue features multiple covers by Jones and Fotos, full 22-page stories in series continuity and a bonus 4-page short that expands on the zombie-infected world of 1968 by horror titan Tim Vigil.\n\nWelcome to 1968... and the end of the world.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Night/ Escape/ Plague/ of the Living Dead:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9372160&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9372160&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n   If you any questions please let me know on my most recent uploads!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af51d4376adac5cd1b8bd35ce56faf5f2550ab78","amp;dn":"%2768+%28Sixty+Eight%29+%2815+Issues%29+%7C+%28Mark+Kidwell%29+%5B2011-2013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af51d4376adac5cd1b8bd35ce56faf5f2550ab78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,81,212,55,106,218,197,205,27,139,211,92,229,111,175,95,37,80,171,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
