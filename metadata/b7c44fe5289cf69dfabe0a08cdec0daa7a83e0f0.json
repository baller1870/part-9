According to Dr. Les Fehmi, a clinical psychologist and researcher, many of us have become stuck in Ã¢â‚¬Å“narrow-focus attentionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: a tense, constricted, survival mode of attention that holds us in a state of chronic stressÃ¢â‚¬â€and which lies at the root of common ailments including anxiety, depression, ADD, stress-related migraines, and more. To improve these conditions, Dr. Fehmi explains that we must learn to return to a relaxed, diffuse, and creative form of attention, which he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open Focus.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nThis highly readable and empowering book offers straightforward explanations and simple exercises on how to shift into a more calm, open style of attention that reduces stress, improves health, and enhances performance.
