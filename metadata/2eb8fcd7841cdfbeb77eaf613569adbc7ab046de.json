For decades, government pundits have dismissed these Ã¢â‚¬Å“coincidentalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ deaths, even regarding them as Ã¢â‚¬Å“mythsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Ã¢â‚¬Å“urban legends.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLike most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these Ã¢â‚¬ËœcoincidencesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. After all, events donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬Å“consult the oddsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously.\n\nHit List is a fair examination of the evidence of each case, leading to (necessarily) different conclusions. The findings were absolutely staggering; as some cases were clearly linked to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“clean-up operationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ after the murder of President Kennedy, while others were the result of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœother forcesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The impeccable research and writing of Richard Belzer and David Wayne show that if the government is trying to hide anything, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the duo who will uncover it.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRichard Belzer is a stand-up comedian, actor and author.
