This is one of the cleanest uploads for Windows XP MCE and it is hard to find on thepiratebay even though I found it. This isn't my torrent but I am sharing it. When done burning you must restart the computer press F12 to boot from CD and press enter highlighted on CD-ROM drive then wait for it to load all the files. Do not upgrade trust me if you upgrade you won't get Media Center and that is the whole purpose of this upload. Much faster and more stable than Windows XP Home Edition, and Windows Vista. For reliability you need a gig or more of RAM if you have less it will freeze a lot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b60c4235f8c42712897cffd6b6fffdab684a5f4a","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Media+Center+Edition+2005+SP3+integrated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b60c4235f8c42712897cffd6b6fffdab684a5f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,12,66,53,248,196,39,18,137,124,255,214,182,255,253,171,104,74,95,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
