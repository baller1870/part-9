I prefer happy endings.\n\nNevertheless it is a very good movie.\n\nI thought I had come across this torrent on Mininova and Pirate Bay, but today\nI could not locate it anywhere. If I'm repeating what has gone before, pardon.\n\nDetails on the storyline are in the Word .doc attached.\n\n\nI'm also ready to upload The Way We Live Now.\nBut after getting it all prepared, I found it was already available,\nbut not too supported. Maybe I'll send mine later.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a59eaf5a39fdb063775661e22d6d65d67543e46","amp;dn":"The+Mayor+of+Casterbridge+%282003%29+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a59eaf5a39fdb063775661e22d6d65d67543e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,89,234,245,163,159,219,6,55,117,102,30,34,214,214,93,103,84,62,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
