Their small time band, that I'm sure could of made it big if they really wanted to. They've hung around Seattle for their whole time playing, and I believe they tour sometimes. Check 'em out, if you like their stuff please find a way to support them some how! They're great guys, and a great band! Thanks a lot!!
