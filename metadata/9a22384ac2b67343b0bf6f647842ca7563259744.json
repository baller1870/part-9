The text offers two broad perspectives of entrepreneurship, a historical one and a comparative perspective. In the historical part, several examples of the co-operation between regional aspects and aspects of entrepreneurship are presented. The second part shows different aspects of entrepreneurship in a more and more globalizing world. Networking, the relationship between clusters and business innovation, economic transition and the links between social capital and business competitiveness are some of the topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a22384ac2b67343b0bf6f647842ca7563259744","amp;dn":"Entrepreneurship+and+Business%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a22384ac2b67343b0bf6f647842ca7563259744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,34,56,74,194,182,115,67,176,191,111,100,120,66,202,117,99,37,151,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
