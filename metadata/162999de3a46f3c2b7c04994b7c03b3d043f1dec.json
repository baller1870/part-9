Well, keep reading.\nThe story:\nA while ago, I became a bit obsessed with getting the Collector's Edition of another 3DS game: Bravely Default, unfortunately it was either sold out in my city or only available at an unbelievably high price. I got frustrated but I decided to try an alternative, and with a simple google search I found out that someone had uploaded the scans from the artbook and the AR cards from the Bravely Default Collector's Edition to a blog. I already had the soundtracks from some asian blog.\nThen a few days ago I got this collector's edition at the same standard price of the regular version, so I didn't hesitate and took it home.\nNow I'm kinda repaying the favor to the world, so this torrent is for all the people who downloaded the game from the eshop, got the standard physical version, are unsure about getting the game at all, are Adventure Time fans, or just got another console version and are curious about these particular contents.\n\nIf you still want a &quot;rom&quot; of the game, it's not that hard to find.\nIf you need more information about steelbooks, google it.\n\nThat's all!\nEnjoy and seed~\nGarler@TPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:162999de3a46f3c2b7c04994b7c03b3d043f1dec","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Collector%27s+content+only%3A+Adventure+Time+Explore+...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"162999de3a46f3c2b7c04994b7c03b3d043f1dec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,41,153,222,58,70,243,194,183,192,73,148,183,192,59,61,4,63,29,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
