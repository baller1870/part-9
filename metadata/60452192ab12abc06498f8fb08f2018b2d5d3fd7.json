In addition, his quirky-blue-collar image is often believed to be a major influence on the public persona of many British musicians, most notably Elvis Costello, Paul Weller and Joe Jackson.\n\nAn official Graham Parker and The Rumour live album, The Parkerilla, issued in 1978, saw Parker in a creative holding pattern. Three sides were live, with no new songs and with versions of previously released songs. Side four was devoted to a &quot;disco&quot; remake of &quot;Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions&quot;. In 1991, Rolling Stone ranked The Parkerilla number 64 on its list of 100 greatest album covers.\n\n\n01.&quot;Lady Doctor&quot; 2:48\n02.&quot;Fool's Gold&quot; 4:23\n03.&quot;Tear Your Playhouse Down&quot; 3:50\n04.&quot;Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions&quot; 5:00\n05.&quot;The Heat in Harlem&quot; 7:35\n06.&quot;Silly Thing&quot; 3:15\n07.&quot;Gypsy Blood&quot; 5:15\n08.&quot;Back to Schooldays&quot; 2:40\n09.&quot;Heat Treatment&quot; 3:06\n10.&quot;Watch the Moon Come Down&quot; 5:15\n11.&quot;New York Shuffle&quot; 2:57\n12.&quot;Soul Shoes&quot; 3:23\n13.&quot;Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions&quot; (studio) 3:51\n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60452192ab12abc06498f8fb08f2018b2d5d3fd7","amp;dn":"Graham+Parker+%26amp%3B+The+Rumour+-+Parkerilla+%281978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60452192ab12abc06498f8fb08f2018b2d5d3fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,69,33,146,171,18,171,192,100,152,248,251,8,242,1,139,45,93,63,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
