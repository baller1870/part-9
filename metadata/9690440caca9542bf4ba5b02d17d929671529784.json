(Eg. UT3 , Check the Log files)\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Features\n\n\nNetworking\n\n    * Internet and LAN play has been a hallmark of Epic's past competitive games such as Unreal Tournament 2003 (and 2004). The Unreal Engine has long provided a flexible and high-level network architecture suitable to many genres of games.\n    * Internet and LAN play is fully supported on PC and all console platforms.\n    * Supports Games for Windows Live, Xbox Live, and GameSpy (PC and PS3) network platforms.\n    * Integrated voice communication on all platforms.\n    * Unreal Engine gameplay network programming is high-level and data-driven, allowing UnrealScript game code to specify variables and functions to be replicated between client and server to maintain a consistent approximation of game state. The low-level game networking transport is UDP-based and combines reliable and unreliable transmission schemes to optimize gameplay, even in low-bandwidth and high-latency scenarios.\n    * Client-server model supporting up to 64 players as provided. Also supports non-dedicated server (peer-to-peer mode) with up to 16 players.\n    * Supports network play between different platforms (i.e. dedicated PC serving console clients; Windows, MacOS and Linux clients playing together.)\n    * All gameplay features are supported in network play, enabling vehicle-based multiplayer games, competitive team games with NPC's or bots, cooperative play in a single player focused game, and so on. Support for auto-downloading and caching content, including cross-platform compatible UnrealScript code. This feature enables everything from user-created maps, to bonus packs, to complete game mods to be downloaded on the fly. In-game server browser GUI for finding and querying servers, keeping track of favorites, in-game chat, etc.\n    * Please note that we don't provide a server or networking framework suitable for massively multiplayer games. Though such a task is a multi man-year engineering effort, several teams using the Unreal Engine have done so (including Sigil Games Online for Vanguard and NCSoft for Lineage II), demonstrating the feasibility of using the Unreal Engine as a MMORPG game client and tools pipeline, integrated with a proprietary server component.\n\nLocalization\n\n    * Unreal Engine 3 content and code are localization-aware, with a simple framework for externalizing all game text, audio, images, and videos. Localized assets can be cooked for seek-free loading.\n    * Unreal Engine 3 is based on the Unicode character set, and has full support for 16-bit Unicode fonts and text input, including importing TrueType fonts into renderable bitmap fonts.\n    * Our games have shipped in 9 languages including Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nProgramming\n\n    * Unreal Engine 3 includes example content and 100% of the source code for the engine, editor, XSI/Max/Maya exporters, and the game-specific code for our internally-developed games.\n    * Extensible, object-oriented C++ engine with software framework for persistence, dynamic loading of code and content, portability, debugging.\n    * UnrealScript gameplay scripting language provides automatic support for metadata; persistence with very flexible file format backwards-compatibility; support for exposing script properties to level designers in UnrealEd; a GUI-based script debugger; and native language support for many concepts important in gameplay programming, such as dynamically scoped state machines and time-based (latent) execution of code.\n    * Modular material component interface for extending visual tool and adding new shader components usable by artists in the visual shader GUI.\n    * Source control friendly software architecture, scalable to large teams and multi-platform projects.\n    * Unreal Engine 3 is provided as one unified codebase that compiles on PC and all supported next-generation console platforms. All game content and data files are compatible across all supported platforms, for fast turnaround time between code and content development on PC, and playtesting on console or PC.\n    * Seek-free DVD loading optimization pass for consoles, able to load levels at &gt;80% of DVD's physical transfer rate. Extensible content-streaming framework suitable for multithreaded background DVD streaming of resources and predefined groups of resources based on LOD or programmatic control.\n\nDebugging and Performance Monitoring Tools\n\n    * Memory tracking tools (including GPU memory).\n    * Remote Control utility ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ extensible tool that runs alongside the game to allow for setting flags and running helper commands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9690440caca9542bf4ba5b02d17d929671529784","amp;dn":"Unreal+Engine+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9690440caca9542bf4ba5b02d17d929671529784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,144,68,12,172,169,84,43,244,186,91,2,209,125,146,150,113,82,151,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
