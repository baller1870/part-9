Lonnie Machin is introduced as &quot;Anarky&quot; as early as his first appearance in Detective Comics No.608, withholding his origin story for a later point. He is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent twelve-year-old. Lonnie Machin made his debut as &quot;Anarky&quot; by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water. Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child. During this first confrontation, Anarky is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances. After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to the OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:764d75dc172407b48115e550be4d0ceb667906c1","amp;dn":"Detective+Comics+Anarky+in+Gotham+City+%28608-609%29+%28digital%29+%28OkC.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"764d75dc172407b48115e550be4d0ceb667906c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,77,117,220,23,36,7,180,129,21,229,80,190,77,12,235,102,121,6,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
