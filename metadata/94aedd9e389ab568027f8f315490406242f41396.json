But that is only half the saying; the full expression is: India grows at night... when the government sleeps, suggesting that the nation may be rising despite the state. Indias is a tale of private success and public failure. Prosperity is, indeed, spreading across the country even as governance failure pervades public life.\n\n\nBut how could a nation become one of the worlds fastest-growing economies when its governed by a weak, ineffective state? And wouldnt it be wonderful if India also grew during the dayin other words, if public policy supported private enterprise?\n\n\nWhat India needs, Gurcharan Das says, is a strong liberal state. Such a state would have the authority to take quick, decisive action; it would have the rule of law to ensure those actions are legitimate; and finally, it would be accountable to the people. But achieving this will not be easy, says Das, because India has historically had a weak state and a strong society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94aedd9e389ab568027f8f315490406242f41396","amp;dn":"India+Grows+At+Night+-+Gurcharan+Das.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94aedd9e389ab568027f8f315490406242f41396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,174,221,158,56,154,181,104,2,127,143,49,84,144,64,98,66,244,19,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
