Only a misunderstood local boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee), who has the ability to speak with the dead, is able to prevent the destruction of his town by a centuries-old witch's curse. He'll also have to take on ghosts, witches, zombies, and (worst of all) the moronic grown-ups. But this young ghoul whisperer may find his paranormal activities pushed to their otherworldly limits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dad8f95b1370929e04ad66d724391dcc6ba4f1f","amp;dn":"Jon+Brion+-+ParaNorman+score","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dad8f95b1370929e04ad66d724391dcc6ba4f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,173,143,149,177,55,9,41,224,74,214,109,114,67,145,220,198,186,79,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
