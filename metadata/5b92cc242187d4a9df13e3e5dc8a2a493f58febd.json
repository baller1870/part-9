Unfortunately, bestseller Niven&amp;#039;s first Ringworld installment in 10 years combines the worst qualities of hard SF (i.e., cardboard characters, a plot propelled primarily by technological infodumps) with the least appealing characteristics of sequelitis (i.e., a story no one can follow without fanatic dedication to earlier books). In the year 2893, 67 Ringworld days after Louis Wu, badly wounded in battle with &quot;the Vampire protector, Bram,&quot; stepped into a healing autodoc, our hero awakens with a restored, younger body. The passive Louis and several alien companions soon get caught up in a war involving weaponery that could destroy Ringworld. The novel finally comes into its own about midway through, while a glossary and a cast of characters will help orient those new to the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b92cc242187d4a9df13e3e5dc8a2a493f58febd","amp;dn":"Larry+Niven+-+Book+4+-+Ringworld%5C%27s+Children","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b92cc242187d4a9df13e3e5dc8a2a493f58febd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,146,204,36,33,135,212,169,223,19,227,229,220,138,42,73,63,88,254,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
