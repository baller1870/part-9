John Lamb Lash's riveting account describes the decisive arc of history from the dawn of Christian Era to the present moment of global terror, a trajectory driven by faith-based violence and fundamentalist politics. Countering the patriarchy of monotheistic religions with Gnostic story of wisdom goddess, Sophia, Not in His Image gives us back  our heritage and guides us beyond  destructive social chaos toward sacred ecological path for the future.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metahistory.org/READING/LashBooks.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metahistory.org/READING/LashBooks.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGnosticism\nMythology\nMysticism\nGaia\nMother-Earth\nFeminism\nEcology\nGoddess\nSelf-Help\nPhilosophy\nTheology\nSpirituality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d783fef645a24521342281eae1d7e82b684e8673","amp;dn":"John+lamb+Lash+-+Not+in+his+Image.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d783fef645a24521342281eae1d7e82b684e8673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,131,254,246,69,162,69,33,52,34,129,234,225,215,232,43,104,78,134,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
