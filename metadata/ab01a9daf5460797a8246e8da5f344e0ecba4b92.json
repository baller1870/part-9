A highly readable narrative follows the development of these Northern peoplesâ€“the Nordmennâ€“from their origins and the legendary pre-history to the military triumphs of Canute and the defeat of Harald HardrÃ¡di at Stamford Bridge in 1066, which symbolically ended the Viking age. The book recounts the Vikings' exploits in war, trade, and colonization: the assault on Western Christendom; the trading and military ventures to the Slav and Muslim worlds and to Byzantium; and the western voyages of discovery and settlement to Greenland, Iceland, and America. Numerous photographs, maps, and drawings contribute to Gwyn Jones's rounded portrait of Viking civilization and vividly evoke the importance in their culture of religion, art, and seafaring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab01a9daf5460797a8246e8da5f344e0ecba4b92","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+Vikings.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab01a9daf5460797a8246e8da5f344e0ecba4b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,1,169,218,245,70,7,151,168,36,110,141,165,243,68,224,236,186,75,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
