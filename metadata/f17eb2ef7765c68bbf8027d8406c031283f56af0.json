Blake Stevens Dugelby\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThis book depicts and describes seven basic models of the FG42, from the earliest prototype (the Type &quot;A&quot;) through the first production series (the Type &quot;E&quot;) with its distinctively swept-back handgrip and intricately machined receiver, then the initial Rheinmetall redesign utilising a stamped receiver (the Type &quot;F&quot;), followed by the ultimate if extremely short-lived final series-production model, the Type &quot;G&quot;. Amazingly, virtually none of the Type &quot;G&quot; components will interchange with their lookalike Type &quot;F&quot;' counterparts. This includes magazines. The 2007 Addendum challenges everything previously known or assumed about the timetable of FG42 development, thus solving some long-standing dilemmas but introducing even more new questions about these fascinating arms. It also includes a comprehensive, up-to-date listing of the serial numbers of every FG42 known to exist all over the world.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Death-From-Above-German-Paratrooper/dp/0889354294&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Death-From-Above-German-Paratrooper/dp/0889354294&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17eb2ef7765c68bbf8027d8406c031283f56af0","amp;dn":"Death+from+above+-+The+German+FG42+Paratroop+Rifle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17eb2ef7765c68bbf8027d8406c031283f56af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,126,178,239,119,101,198,139,191,128,39,216,64,108,3,18,131,245,106,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
