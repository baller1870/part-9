Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfilment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamund and pioneering of medical methods threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past. As their stories interweave, George Eliot creates a richly nuanced and moving drama, hailed by Virginia Woolf as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“one of the few English novels written for adult peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Listening to Maureen OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢BrienÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cool, intelligent reading... Her voice, a combination of prudish and passionate, sense and sensibility, is irresistibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - Sue Arnold, Guardian\n\nIn general Middlemarch has retained its popularity and status as one of the masterpieces of English fiction, although some reviewers have expressed dissatisfaction at the destiny recorded for Dorothea. In separate centuries, Florence Nightingale and Kate Millet both remarked on the eventual subordination of Dorothea's own dreams to those of her admirer, Ladislaw; however, Virginia Woolf gave the book unstinting praise, describing Middlemarch as &quot;the magnificent book that, with all its imperfections, is one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.&quot; Martin Amis and Julian Barnes have cited it as probably the greatest novel in the English language.
