On delicate, airy ballads (&quot;Stay Away&quot;), choral blues (&quot;If the Sea Was Whiskey&quot;), Celtic-flavored reels (&quot;O Santo de Polvora&quot;), and covers of Jimmie Rodgers and the Strokes, Thile demonstrates impeccable musical instincts. Naturally, the playing shines, not least on the album's several lightning-paced bluegrass jams. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/19/chris-thile/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/19/chris-thile/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:600482f66ae9b51c172193722d153929e8316550","amp;dn":"Chris+Thile...How+to+Grow+a+Woman+from+the+Ground%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"600482f66ae9b51c172193722d153929e8316550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,4,130,246,106,233,181,28,23,33,147,114,45,21,57,41,232,49,101,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
