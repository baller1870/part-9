Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and catalytic processes will be discussed in a unified and comprehensive approach. There will be extensive cross-referencing within all volumes. This volume covers all the biomass sources and gives detailed and in-depth coverage of all current chemical/catalytic conversion processes of biomass into liquid hydrocarbons to be further used as a feedstock for the production of not only biofuels but a large array of chemicals.\n\nOffers an in-depth coverage of all catalytic topics of current interest and outlines the future challenges and research areas\nA clear and visual description of all parameters and conditions enables the reader to draw conclusions for a particular case\nOutline the catalytic processes applicable to energy generation and design of green processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4855a07a572b33b5a03f99f1bdac34404fd1ef5a","amp;dn":"New+and+Future+Developments+in+Catalysis+-+Catalytic+Biomass+Con","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4855a07a572b33b5a03f99f1bdac34404fd1ef5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,85,160,122,87,43,51,181,160,63,153,241,189,172,52,64,79,209,239,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
