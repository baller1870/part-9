Karl Heinz Boehm stars as Mark, the son of a psychologist who kept a video journal of the boy's upbringing for research purposes. The constant intrusions profoundly affected the boy, who grew up to be a photographer himself; but his principal subject matter consists of women whom he murders before the camera. He then runs the films of his victims in their final throes so that he can study their reactions to death--a perverse extension of his father's experiments, which tormented Mark to analyze his reactions to raw fear. The British press had long been hostile to the unorthodox films of Powell  and his partner Emeric Pressburger; when Peeping Tom came around, they used the film to castigate him as &quot;sick&quot; and tawdry. The passage of time has proven Peeping Tom as profound and accomplished as any of Powell's earlier films, and it ranks with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo  (1958) as a landmark exploration of the links among voyeurism, violence, and male sexual desire. Powell  himself plays the evil father in the flashback sequences, and his son Colomba plays Mark as a child. \n\n IMDb.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054167/\n Year.............: 1960\n Country..........: UK\n Runtime..........: 101 Minutes\n Audio............: English(DD 2.0 Dolby)\n Subtitles........: English, Spanish (custom), French (custom), Portuguese (custom)\n Video Format.....: NTSC\n Aspect Ratio.....: 1.66:1\n DVD Source.......: DVD9\n DVD Distributor..: Criterion (release date: Nov 16, 1999)\n Bitrate..........:  6.58 mb/s \n Size...............: 7,51 GB\n\nUntouched Criterion DVD, with custom subtitles.\n\nPosted originally at Cinematik by elhippie, whom we thank.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5394940459d2feb706f3a6cb6137f057a6fbe5f0","amp;dn":"Michael+Powell+-+Peeping+Tom+%28Criterion%2C+1960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5394940459d2feb706f3a6cb6137f057a6fbe5f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,148,148,4,89,210,254,183,6,243,166,203,97,55,240,87,166,251,229,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
