We'll cover how to set up Jasmine to be used with Grunt and Node.js so that we can run the unit tests automatically as part of a build process, and we'll delve into all of the different features that the framework has to offer. Starting with the structure of our test files, through to mocking dependencies, using asynchronous specs, adding plugins for things like jQuery and working with RequireJS modules.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58fceefa73b16068e552e92ca4598027d2b2bf72","amp;dn":"Tutsplus+-+JavaScript+Testing+With+Jasmine+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58fceefa73b16068e552e92ca4598027d2b2bf72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,252,238,250,115,177,96,104,229,82,233,44,164,89,128,39,210,178,191,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
