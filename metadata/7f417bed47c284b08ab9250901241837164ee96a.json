The articles are really old, so they are archived and you cannot find them by normal searching (i.e., &quot;googling&quot;).\n\nI really liked the way he presented the information. I think it's indispensable. I wanted to make the articles easier to read for myself and thought I'd share. \n\nThe author thought about making them into a book, but there hasn't been one yet. If there happens to be one, I will take down this torrent and go buy the book... Until then, I'll just keep sharing.\n\nI take no credit for the information provided. I am not affiliated with the website or the author. The information is free to view and I'm just re-sharing it.\n\nHope you enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f417bed47c284b08ab9250901241837164ee96a","amp;dn":"50+Tools+That+Can+Improve+Your+Writing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f417bed47c284b08ab9250901241837164ee96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,65,123,237,71,194,132,176,138,185,37,9,1,36,24,55,22,78,233,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
