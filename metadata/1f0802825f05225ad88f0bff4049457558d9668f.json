The purpose of this Atlas is to focus the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention on a series of bone, ligament, muscle and tendon structures and ultrastructures within the shoulder on which only the most recent international literature has reported in specialized journals. This Atlas also presents extremely high-definition images of &quot;targeted&quot; sections obtained from cadavers preserved using state-of-art techniques. This unique Atlas, making use of images of major visual impact, offers a scientific message on a topical joint, using simple but dedicated descriptive language.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0802825f05225ad88f0bff4049457558d9668f","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+Functional+Shoulder+Anatomy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0802825f05225ad88f0bff4049457558d9668f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,8,2,130,95,5,34,90,216,143,11,255,64,73,69,117,88,217,102,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
