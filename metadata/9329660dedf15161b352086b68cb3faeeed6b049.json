Developed by the Design-Team &quot;DreamFactorystudio&quot; this scenery represents an absolute realistic recreation of the complete Swedish real airport. \n\nStockholm Arlanda is the third biggest airport in Scandinavia. As it covers a rather large area there is very much to see while taxiing to or from one of the 64 gates. The parallel runways (01L/01R) are a guarantee to see AI traffic close to your own aircraft, something we always appreciate when we depart or arrive. \n\nThe airport has been totally rebuilt with photo realistic ground textures and enhanced textures. Almost every building has been included in the new version. Developed by the Design-Team &quot;DreamFactorystudio&quot; this scenery represents an absolute realistic recreation of the complete Swedish real airport. A FSX version will be available soon and without any additional costs for customers of this version. \n\nFeatures:\n\nAll important buildings created with the aid of real photographs of the airport\nDynamic and animated objects\nHigh resolution day- and night textures\nHigh resolution areal photo texture\nSeasonal textures\nDocking systems\nCorrected landclass files\nTaxiways, apron with realistic rendered textures\nComplete apron markings\nAI compatible\nFor FS2004 and later FSX\nCustomers purchasing the FS2004 version will again receive a free FSX version when its available.
