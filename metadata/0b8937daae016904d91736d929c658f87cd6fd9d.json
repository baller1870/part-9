It goes the extra mile to teach you AppleScriptexplaining advanced topics without leaving you behind.\n\nAppleScript is the high-level scripting language that resides on the Mac platform. It can be used to add functionality to the Mac operating system, automate tasks, add functions, and generally make things easier.
