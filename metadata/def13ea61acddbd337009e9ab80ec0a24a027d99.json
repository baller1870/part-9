After a 50-year hiatus these weapons of war re-appeared in the Macedonian armies of Philip II and Alexander the Great, a period that saw the height of their development in the Ancient World. The experience of warfare with both the Carthaginians during the later-3rd century BC, and Philip V of Macedon during the early-2nd century BC, finally prompted the introduction of the siege tower and the battering ram to the Roman arsenal. This title traces the development and use of these weapons across the whole of this period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def13ea61acddbd337009e9ab80ec0a24a027d99","amp;dn":"Greek+and+Roman+Siege+Machinery+399+BC-AD+363","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def13ea61acddbd337009e9ab80ec0a24a027d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,241,62,166,26,205,219,211,55,0,158,154,184,14,192,162,74,2,125,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
