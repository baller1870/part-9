In this course, author Aaron F. Ross shows how to create materials and shaders for 3D objects, characters, and landscapes, with reflectivity, transparency, and amazing texture. Become more comfortable building shader networks and open up a lot of new possibilities for creative surfaces in Maya.\n\nTopics include:\nGetting familiar with Hypershade\nMaking and breaking connections\nUsing mental ray materials\nAdding reflectivity with ray tracing\nRendering refractions\nMapping translucence\nAdding surface relief detail\nAdjusting and combining textures\nConstructing a stylized non-photoreal shader\nWorking with math and utility nodes\nRendering ink and paint with Maya Toon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1bce463cff271f3d121c8be574b2f4c1d5db73","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Creating+Shader+Networks+in+Maya+and+Mental+Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1bce463cff271f3d121c8be574b2f4c1d5db73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,27,206,70,60,255,39,31,61,18,28,139,229,116,178,244,193,213,219,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
