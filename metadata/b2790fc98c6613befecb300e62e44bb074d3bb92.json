In doing so, he highlights some fascinating parallels between ancient Roman society and the modern world.\n\nAs accessible as it is authoritative and scholarly, The Rise of Rome is the perfect introduction to Roman history and civilization.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2790fc98c6613befecb300e62e44bb074d3bb92","amp;dn":"The+Rise+of+Ancient+Rome+-+Anthony+Everitt++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2790fc98c6613befecb300e62e44bb074d3bb92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,121,15,201,140,102,19,190,254,203,48,14,98,228,75,176,116,211,187,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
