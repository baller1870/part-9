Recommended!'&quot; -- Aerospace --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nFrom the Back Cover\n\n\n\nMechanics of Flight is an ideal introduction to the principles of flight. The eleventh edition has been completely reset and the text updated to conform to current teaching practices and technical knowledge. Written in a clear jargon-free style, the book contains simple numerical examples which are suitable for students up to HND level and for first year degree students.\n\nThe book commences with a summary of the relevant aspects of mechanics, and goes on to cover topics such as air and airflow, aerofoils, thrust, level flight, gliding, landing, performance, manoeuvres and stability and control. Important aspects of these topics are illustrated by a description of a trial flight in a light aircraft. The book also deals with flight at transonic and supersonic speeds, and finally orbital flight and spacecraft.\n\nKey Features\n\nA straightforward practical approach to the subject based on the application of the basic principles of mechanics.\nDescriptions are aided by the use of a large number of illustrations and photographs.\nNumerical questions with answers make it suitable as a course teaching resource.\nNon-numerical questions and answers are included to allow readers to assess their own understanding.\n\nMechanics of Flight is an excellent text for student pilots, students of aeronautical and aerospace engineering, aircraft engineering apprentices and anyone who is interested in aircraft.\n\nA recommended follow-up book is Aircraft Flight (also published by Pearson Prentice Hall) by Richard Barnard and David Philpott. The authors have also provided the recent and current revisions of Mechanics of Flight.\n\nR. H. Barnard PhD, CEng, FRAeS; formerly Principal Lecturer in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Hertfordshire.\n\nD. R. Philpott PhD, CEng, MRAeS; formerly Principal Aerodynamic Specialist at Raytheon Corporate Jets and Reader in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Hertfordshire.\n\nSEED as long as you can","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b82afc8b90cab93bd86b69f0a000523b24324a65","amp;dn":"Mechanics+of+Flight+11th+Edition+by+A.C.+Kermode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b82afc8b90cab93bd86b69f0a000523b24324a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,42,252,139,144,202,185,59,216,107,105,240,160,0,82,59,36,50,74,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
