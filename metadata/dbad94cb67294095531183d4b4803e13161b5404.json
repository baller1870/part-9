Weight and weightlessness, the discoveries of the planets Neptune and Pluto, and the universality of gravitation are also discussed. Segment length: 43 minutes\n\n    Gravity II: The discussion of gravitation continues with the emphasis on ocean, earth, and atmospheric tides. Other topics include tunnels through the earth, black holes, the big bang, and speculations of an oscillating universe. Segment length: 42 minutes\n\n    Satellite Motion: The concept of simple projectile motion is extended to include satellite motion- first circular, and then, elliptical. After a discussion of escape speed, the tape concludes with a summary of previously learned concepts in mechanics. Segment length: 40 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbad94cb67294095531183d4b4803e13161b5404","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive%21+-+Volume+4+-+Gravity%2C+Satellite+Motion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbad94cb67294095531183d4b4803e13161b5404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,173,148,203,103,41,64,149,83,17,131,212,180,128,62,19,22,27,84,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
