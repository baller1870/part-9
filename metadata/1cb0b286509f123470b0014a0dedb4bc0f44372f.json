Early in the voyage, however, disaster struck, and the command section was destroyed along with its crew.\n\nCenturies later, a young man, Devon (Keir Dullea), a resident of a biosphere with an Amish-like culture, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. He inadvertently finds his way into the service areas of the ship and uncovers its fate: the bridge has been destroyed, the crew killed and the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun. Devon and his fellow escapees Rachel (Gay Rowan) and Garth (Robin Ward) must find the backup bridge if they are to save the Ark and the colonists aboard. Occasionally, they are aided by the Ark's computer systems portrayed by William Osler.\n\nThese were ripped from the DVD (not lo-def VHS or 3rd generation TV tape ) and compiled with HandBrake. I'm not a pro at this but I thought that others would enjoy something watchable. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cb0b286509f123470b0014a0dedb4bc0f44372f","amp;dn":"The+Starlost+Complete+%281973+DVDRip+M4V%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cb0b286509f123470b0014a0dedb4bc0f44372f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,176,178,134,80,159,18,52,112,176,1,74,13,237,180,188,15,68,55,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
