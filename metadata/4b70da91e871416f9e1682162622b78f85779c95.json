Understanding his story provides a clear insight into Islam and the incredible importance this subject holds for our future.\nThis is also the most amazing story never told. It is said that truth is stranger than fiction and you just could not have made this up. There are battles, murders, intrigues, rapes, assassinations, torture, intimidation, and much much more. Along the way Mohammed invented Jihad, the most effective system of conquest ever devised.\nThis amazing book reads like an adventure story and brings the Islamic perspective to life in a way that is both fascinating and informative.\nMillions of people, both Muslims and non Muslims are tragically affected by aspects of Islam. More than 95% of all wars and armed conflict today involve Muslims. Muslims also suffer some of the highest rates of poverty, disease, hunger, illiteracy, environmental degradation and many more crippling disadvantages. By tackling the subject head on, this book gives the reader the ability to consider and discuss this subject from a position of knowledge, understanding and truth. \n\nAbout the author:\nHarry Richardson is a long-time student of Islam and author of best seller, &quot;the Story Of Mohammed - Islam Unveiled'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b70da91e871416f9e1682162622b78f85779c95","amp;dn":"The+Story+Of+Mohammed+-+Harry+Richardson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b70da91e871416f9e1682162622b78f85779c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,112,218,145,232,113,65,111,158,22,130,22,38,34,183,143,133,119,156,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
