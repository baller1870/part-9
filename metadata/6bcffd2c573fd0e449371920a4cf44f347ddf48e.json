Kelsey Grammer kinda-sorta did a remake of this in 1996 with Down Periscope, this is better.\n\n\n\n                     Operation Petticoat (1959) \n\nA submarine newly commissioned is damaged in the opening days of WW II. A captain, looking for a command insists he can get it to a dockyard and captain it. Going slowly to this site, they find a stranded group of Army nurses and must take them aboard. How bad can it get? Trying to get a primer coat on the sub, they have to mix white and red in order to have enough. When forced to flee the dock during an air attack, they find themselves with the world's only Pink submarine, still with 5 women in the tight quarters of a submarine.\n\n\n        Cary Grant\t ... \tLt.
