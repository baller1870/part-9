They were a hard-edged band with a flair for the dramatic, styling themselves as the devil's answer to the sainted Beatles.\n\nA young, inexperienced producer named Andrew Loog Oldham first heard the band at a session he remembers with four words: 'I fell in love.' Though unfamiliar with such basic industry practices as mixing a recording, he made a brilliant decision - he pitched the band to a studio that had passed on the Beatles. Afraid to make the same mistake twice, they signed the Stones, and began a history-making career.\n\nThis is just one of the 50 classic stories that make up 50 Licks. Many are never-before told, some are from exclusive interviews - including with elusive bassist Bill Wyman - and all are illustrated and told by the people who lived them.\n\nHalf a century on, the Rolling Stones are still the greatest band working. And this is the book to commemorate their unparalleled achievement in rock music.\n\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Publishing (14 Feb 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1408833824\nISBN-13: 978-1408833827","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b98633e9f080da9313c22cc5647552f06bfc59e","amp;dn":"50+Licks+Myths+and+Stories+from+Half+a+Century+of+the+Rolling+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b98633e9f080da9313c22cc5647552f06bfc59e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,152,99,62,159,8,13,169,49,60,34,204,86,71,85,47,6,191,197,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
