DeVerberate is a reverb reduction plug-in that can attenuate or boost the reverberation that is already present in recorded material. The novel real-time algorithm works equally well with mono as with stereo recordings and splits the incoming audio into an estimation of the direct sound and the reverberated sound which can then be recombined freely. The improvement process can be monitored visually using the spectral representations of the input and output signal as well as of the estimated reverberation.\n\n\n\n\nUse Cases\n\n  Attenuate reverberation in existing recordings\n   Change the perceived distance in a mix by changing the balance between the direct sound and the reverberation\n   Improve dialog and location sound\n   Forensic specialist can improve speech intelligibility\n   Boost the natural reverberation in existing recordings\n   Separate adjustments of the direct sound and the reverberation levels\n   Manual adjustment of the decay time of the original reverberation\n   Frequency spectrum representation of the of the following signals:\n       Input signal\n       Output signal\n       Estimated reverberation\n   Frequency emphasis filter for the the reduction level\n       High and low shelving filters with variable slopes (-3 to -96 dB / octave)\n       High and low peak filters with adjustable bandwidth (0.1 to 3.0 octaves)\n       Graphical representation of frequency response\n       Editing of filter settings through handles in the frequency response curve\n\n\n\nPC Version (Windows)\n\n  A Pentium IV or higher\n   Minimum 256 MB RAM (1 GB recommended)\n   Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP\n   A host application that is compatible with VST or AAX (32 bit or 64 bit)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n\n              1.
