The heavily orchestrated work will have listeners at the edge of their seats, capturing the collaborative brilliance of Williams and Spielberg. This twentieth anniversary edition includes the four bonus tracks personally selected by John Williams: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The History Lesson,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stalling Around,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Coming StormÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hungry Raptor.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The soundtrack remains one of WilliamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ greatest achievements and one of musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest scores. This is a quintessential must-have album.\n\n\n John Williams' score for what has become the most successful movie of all time is similar to his scores for other popular Steven Spielberg films. He remains firmly in the tradition of the lush, heavily orchestrated score. This is the first horror movie he and Spielberg have collaborated on since Jaws, but there is nothing like the threatening theme that helped define that monster movie here. Instead, there is a lot of quiet music, a much more subtle touch, and a wistful theme that runs throughout, although things do come to a boil now and then.\n\n In 2013, Universal Music has announced the digital release of the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack of Jurassic Park, which includes John WilliamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ newly remastered music from the film, as well as four bonus tracks (a total of 11 minutes of unreleased music). The four bonus tracks featured on the remastered Jurassic Park album were chosen by Williams in conjunction with his music editor, Ramiro Belgardt. Williams and Belgradt went back through all of the master tapes of the film to spot cues that were not released on the original album. These tracks have never before been commercially released.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Opening Titles\n 02 - Theme from Jurassic Park\n 03 - Incident at Isla Nublar\n 04 - Journey to the Island\n 05 - The Raptor Attack\n 06 - Hatching Baby Raptor\n 07 - Welcome to Jurassic Park\n 08 - My Friend, the Brachiosaurus\n 09 - Dennis Steals the Embryo\n 10 - A Tree For My Bed\n 11 - High-Wire Stunts\n 12 - Remembering Petticoat Lane\n 13 - Jurassic Park Gate\n 14 - Eye to Eye\n 15 - T-Rex Rescue &amp; Finale\n 16 - End Credits\n 17 - The History Lesson [Bonus Track]\n 18 - Stalling Around [Bonus Track]\n 19 - The Coming Storm [Bonus Track]\n 20 - Hungry Raptor [Bonus Track]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58849830896a6cd6717eb5d0a12e279ab4e8c474","amp;dn":"John+Williams+-Jurassic+Park+%281993%29+%7BHDTracks+24-96%7D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58849830896a6cd6717eb5d0a12e279ab4e8c474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,132,152,48,137,106,108,214,113,126,181,208,161,46,39,154,180,232,196,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
