If I&amp;#039;m not wrong I have included all the music from their albums. Now, let&amp;#039;s get to the details:\n\nEverything is encoded as MP3, at 128 kbps. It sounds well enough, if you need more, go buy an audio CD as their audio is encoded lossless. Don&amp;#039;t encode into Ogg Vorbis because you&amp;#039;ll surely get worse sound as the formats are very different.\n\nThe MP3 tags are messed up and I&amp;#039;m too lazy to edit them cause I don&amp;#039;t use them ;)\nJust edit them yourself, you can do this from Windows Explorer on XP and Vista, and on other operating systems there are many ways to do it.\n\nThe files have a number at the beginning of their name in order for players to list them in their order on the albums. You can get rid of it if you want.\n\n\n\nThat&amp;#039;s all! After you get it, please seed! Thank you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb1e4a3db480db396372739458987b689d19368","amp;dn":"Modern+Talking+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb1e4a3db480db396372739458987b689d19368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,177,228,163,219,72,13,179,150,55,39,57,69,137,135,182,137,209,147,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
