Since first making regular appearances at L.A.'s legendary Goodlife open mic sessions circa 1994, this MC has steadily found the ideal balance of strong lyrical substance and high entertainment value. Unafraid to sing his own hooks and break out multiple flows within single songs, Ab Rude is one of the most multifarious graduates of the fertile L.A. rap scene. Learning from some of the movement's best, the guidance received from his original group, Abstract Tribe Unique (ATU), along with Freestyle Fellowship and the A-Team (Aceyalone &amp; Ab) has proven to be invaluable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0f734b3a3703119f00b29bcc8bdfd0c80e75236","amp;dn":"Abstract+Rude+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0f734b3a3703119f00b29bcc8bdfd0c80e75236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,247,52,179,163,112,49,25,240,11,41,188,200,189,253,12,128,231,82,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
