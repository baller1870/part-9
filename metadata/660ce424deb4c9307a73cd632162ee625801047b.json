Extreme realism and sound\n     quality, fast and easy set up, total plug-in integration to your\n     digital audio workstation.\n     \n     Customized 10, 18 or 32 piece kits are at your fingertips, with full\n     control over tuning, damping, ambience levels, velocity response and\n     more.

BFD2 lets you\n     configure your sounds like a real drum kit instead of pushing buttons\n     on a sampler.\n     \n     You can even import your own stereo sample-sets with multiple velocity\n     layers so you can mix and layer your own sounds with BFD2\\'s for\n     experimental kits and \\'drum-replacement\\' production tricks.\n.\n.\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660ce424deb4c9307a73cd632162ee625801047b","amp;dn":"FXPansion.BFD.v2.0.VSTi.RTAS.AU.HYBRiD.DVDR.DYNAMiCS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660ce424deb4c9307a73cd632162ee625801047b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,12,228,36,222,180,201,48,122,115,205,99,33,98,238,98,88,1,4,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
