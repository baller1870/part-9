Ty is concerned about that and has worries of his own too. Lou's arc about Peter, Dubai and Heartland/the dude ranch continues. Ashley wants her and Caleb to get along with her mother Val. And Mrs. Bell and Sugarfoot are a big part of this episode.\n\nThe resolution is 624x352 and the quality is pretty good in my opinion. This episode aired on CBC on Oct 10, 2010. \n\nCBC has a big Heartland website at http://www.cbc.ca/heartland/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1d09c6fc77c51ea32b806fd22e04115488d462","amp;dn":"Heartland.CA.S04E03.Road.Curves.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1d09c6fc77c51ea32b806fd22e04115488d462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,29,9,198,252,119,197,30,163,43,128,111,210,46,4,17,84,136,212,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
