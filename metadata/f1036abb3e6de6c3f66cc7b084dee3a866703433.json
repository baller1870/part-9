At its largest itâ€™s thought the empire included 50-60 million inhabitants â€“ and these are just the conservative estimates, as recent research puts the total number of inhabitants in a range between 70 and 100 million people. While the sheer age of the empire â€“ which started as a kingdom and then a republic â€“ makes researching life in ancient Rome a dii cult task, it is helped by the fact that the Romans made great ef orts to document their way of life and their military success. In fact, the roots of modern civilisation can be found in ancient Rome, and its rich culture, romantic mythology and intricate political systems still intrigue and inspire people today.
