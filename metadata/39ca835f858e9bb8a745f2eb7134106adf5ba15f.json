Although principally oriented towards 'internal' history, 'external' history is considered in outline in the Introduction and is referred to throughout. \n\nThis is a thoroughly revised, updated and expanded edition of Ralph Penny's authoritative textbook, first published in 1991. As well as adding insights from recent scholarship throughout the text, Professor Penny has added a new chapter which discusses the nature of linguistic history, the concept of World Spanish, processes of convergence and divergence in Spanish, and the English/Spanish interface. \n\nThis edition also contains a glossary of technical terms, guidance on further reading, and suggested topics for discussion. Written as a textbook, the comprehensive coverage of the major varieties of Spanish given here will be welcomed by scholars and students alike.\n\nThis is a .djvu file and requires a .djvu viewer. I have included WinDjView (an Open Source viewer from sourceforge.net) in a .zip file.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ca835f858e9bb8a745f2eb7134106adf5ba15f","amp;dn":"A+History+of+The+Spanish+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ca835f858e9bb8a745f2eb7134106adf5ba15f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,202,131,95,133,142,155,184,167,69,242,235,113,52,16,106,223,91,161,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
