The Fingerstyle Machine Gun...\nI still remember when I was 14 and listened to a wonderful guitar tune...\nI asked: &quot;Who are the guys playing?&quot;\nand my mate replied: &quot;Dude, there's a SINGLE man playing here even if it seems there are three...&quot; :)\n\n\nTogether with Robbie Basho and John Fahey, Leo Kottke is part of the Trimurti whence the modern fingerstyle guitar originated.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kottke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kottke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhat follows should be a good sample of his works...
