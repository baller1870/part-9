Joss Stone\n\n\n\nOne of this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broadcast treats has been the new Radio 2 show Nitin Sawhney Spins The Globe. Enthusiastically and unsnobbishly eclectic in his tastes, the prolific producer and composer brought the concept of Radio 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s great Late Junction to the masses, easily breaking down the apartheid between &quot;world music&quot; and more mainstream rock and pop. Offering likable insight into a range of genres, he played Radiohead back to back with Malian ngoni maestro Bassekou Kouyate, and followed a Ravi Shankar raga with the jazz-pop of his daughter Norah Jones.\nAs a polymath musician, he blends jazz, pop, soul, classical, electronica and rap from a coolly-turned kaleidoscope of cultural backgrounds. His work (which includes over 50 film and TV scores as well as collaborations with Paul McCartney and Sting) has placed the fiery strum of flamenco guitar into the controlled laboratory conditions of ambient electro and provided thoughtful social commentary via a concept record featuring a spoken-word monologue from John Hurt.\nThis April, Sawhney invited 100 fans to come and see him and his band perform highlights from his career, plus four new songs from an album due later this year at Metropolis Studios Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an ex-power station in Chiswick. The whole thing was recorded straight to vinyl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a process so technically intricate and musically transparent that apparently no artist has risked it since Thelma Houston &amp; Pressure Cooker recorded IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got The Music In Me in 1975. As the team from Metropolis explain: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Synchronised, simultaneous live performing, mixing, mastering and cutting of the record eliminates all scope for hiding behind modern production techniques... Once we start to cut the lacquer, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no going back!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe result is a characteristically fluid combination of virtuosity and mellowness with production thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressively warm and sharp. It opens with a new song, Accept Yourself: Sawhney plucking a tumbling, folk-blues riff from his guitar as a trio of female vocalists harmonise and a jazz flute wafts about. From there we drift dreamily through his back catalogue. The arrangements are relatively minimalist and the highly skilled band put their hearts into it. The voices of Nicki Wells and Ashwin Srinivasan float like silk over the tabla on a gorgeous rendition of Nadia (from 1999Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Beyond Skin). Joss Stone adds easy-going soul to the piano-based R&amp;B of another new number, I Ask You. Nobody really lets rip, though. SawhneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound is too philosophical and accommodating for that. He lays out his songs like beautiful floor cushions for you, so you can lie back and let your mind wander beyond its own borders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e29673292c0b06b42e43f03f64d62935250290d","amp;dn":"Nitin+Sawhney+-+OneZero+%28Past%2C+Present%2C+Future+Unplugged%29+%5B2013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e29673292c0b06b42e43f03f64d62935250290d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,41,103,50,146,192,176,107,66,228,63,3,246,77,98,147,82,80,41,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
