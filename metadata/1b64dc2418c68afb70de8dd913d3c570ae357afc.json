Wolsey's ambition knows no bounds and when his chief ally, Queen Katherine, interferes in the King's romance with Ann Boleyn, he brings ruin upon himself, the Queen and centuries of English obedience to Rome.\n\nDominc Rowan\nIan McNeice\nKate DuchÃƒÂªne\nMiranda Raison.\n\n\nFrom the Wiki\n\n  The building itself is constructed entirely of English oak, with mortise and tenon jintsand is, in this sense, an &quot;authentic&quot; 16th century timber-framed building - as no structural steel was used.\n\n The seats are simple benches (though cushions can be hired for performances) and the Globe has the first and only thatched roof permitted in London since the Great Fire of 1666. The modern thatch is well protected by fire retardants, and sprinklers on the roof ensure further protection against fire.\n\n The pit has a concrete surface, as opposed to earthen-ground covered with strewn rush from the original theatre. The theatre has extensive backstage support areas for actors and musicians and is attached to a modern lobby, restaurant, gift shop and visitor centre. Seating capacity is 857 with an additional 700 &quot;groundlings&quot; standing in the pit, making up an audience about half the size of a typical audience in Shakespeare's time.\n\n\n  My notes:\n\n  Unlike the comedies Henry VIII is one  of the historical plays written by Shakespeare from histories of the period from other writers.  \n\n  These uploads are presented in the hope that the Shakespeare Globe On Screen series becomes a part of libraries everywhere for the enjoyment of everyone.  Encourage your schools and public libraries to acquire them from the source.\n\n  These productions are also shown in movie theatres in the same manner as Met Opera performances are shown at local cinemas.\n\n  Support the Globe any way you can and enjoy the performances.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b64dc2418c68afb70de8dd913d3c570ae357afc","amp;dn":"Shakespeares+Globe+On+Screen+Henry+VIII+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b64dc2418c68afb70de8dd913d3c570ae357afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,100,220,36,24,198,138,251,112,222,141,217,19,211,197,112,174,53,122,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
