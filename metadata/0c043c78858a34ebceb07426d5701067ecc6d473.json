Only weeks ago, sinking into the Sleep was fun. The VirtNet combined the most cutting-edge technology and the most sophisticated gaming for a full mind-body experience. And it was Michaelâ€™s passion. But now every time Michael sinks, he risks his life.\r\nThe games are over. The VirtNet has become a world of deadly consequences, and Kaine grows stronger by the day. The Mortality Doctrineâ€”Kaineâ€™s master planâ€”has nearly been realized, and little by little the line separating the virtual from the real is blurring. If Kaine succeeds, it will mean worldwide cyber domination. And it looks like Michael and his friends are the only ones who can put the monster back in the boxâ€”if Michael can figure out who his friends really are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Erik Davies\r\nFormat: M4B\r\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c043c78858a34ebceb07426d5701067ecc6d473","amp;dn":"James+Dashner+-+The+Game+of+Lives+%28The+Mortality+Doctrine+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c043c78858a34ebceb07426d5701067ecc6d473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,4,60,120,133,138,52,235,206,176,116,38,213,112,16,103,236,198,212,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
