Studio trickery was more present throughout, with some tracks, including some of Ian AndersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flute parts and piano playing by John Evan (listed as a guest on the album but a full-fledged member of the band through 1980) played backwards or at varying speeds. The success of the album paved the way for more great prog efforts by Tull, including follow-up albums Aqualung and Thick As a Brick.\n\nThe expanded Benefit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ excitingly, one of the first titles from the Chrysalis catalogue to be reissued through Rhino (Warner purchased the Chrysalis assets from Universal after its acquisition of EMI earlier this year) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ features nearly all of the album and single-only material from the era newly remixed by Wilson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the complete album, outtake Ã¢â‚¬Å“Singing All DayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and non-LP single sides Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet DreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½17? and both U.K. single and U.S. album versions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teacher.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The U.K. A-side of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Teacher,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WitchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Promise,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has not been remixed, as multitracks could not be located.) There will be new stereo mixes on the setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first disc, and stereo and 5.1 surround mixes on an accompanying DVD.\n\nAdditionally, a bonus disc features original stereo and mono mixes of the non-LP material (several of the mixes released here for the first time) and some of the album tracks, as well as bonus radio spots.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341b8a98a24c9256a3226f4d8f95c9ca15a77093","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+Benefit+%5BCollector%27s+Edition%5D+%282013%29+MP3%40320kbps+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341b8a98a24c9256a3226f4d8f95c9ca15a77093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,27,138,152,162,76,146,86,163,34,111,77,143,149,201,202,21,167,112,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
