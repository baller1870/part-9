The trio's nervous, reggae-injected pop/rock was punky, but it wasn't necessarily punk. All three members were considerably more technically proficient than the average punk or new wave band. Andy Summers had a precise guitar attack that created dense, interlocking waves of sounds and effects. Stewart Copeland could play polyrhythms effortlessly. And Sting, with his high, keening voice, was capable of constructing infectiously catchy pop songs. While they weren't punk, the Police certainly demonstrated that the punk spirit could have a future in pop music. As their career progressed, the Police grew considerably more adventurous, experimenting with jazz and various world musics. All the while, the band's tight delivery and mastery of the pop single kept their audience increasing, and by 1983, they were the most popular rock &amp; roll band in the world. Though they were at the height of their fame, internal tensions caused the band to splinter apart in 1984, with Sting picking up the majority of the band's audience to become an international superstar.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Roxanne\n02.Can't Stand Losing You\n03.Message In A Bottle\n04.Walking On The Moon\n05.Don't Stand So Close To Me\n06.De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\n07.Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\n08.Invisible Sun\n09.Spirits In The Material World\n10.Every Breath You Take\n11.King Of Pain\n12.Wrapped Around Your Finger\n13.Don't Stand So Close To Me '86\n14.Message in a Bottle (New Classic Rock Mix)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af62bee51fd697828aaa4a53c9385491244d044","amp;dn":"The+Police+-+The+Classics+%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af62bee51fd697828aaa4a53c9385491244d044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,246,43,238,81,253,105,120,40,170,164,165,60,147,133,73,18,68,208,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
