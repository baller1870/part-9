The result is an explosion of amazing new work by contemporary artists. This volume surveys the current revival of this loveliest of mediums, in portfolios from more than 20 of today's top watercolor artists from around the globe. From the evocative visual journals of Danny Gregory and Fabrice Moireau, through the fashion-inspired portraits of Samantha Hahn and Virginia Johnson, to the indie art stylings of Jane Mount and Becca Stadtlander, Watercolor stunningly showcases painterly brilliance. With artist profiles, an informative history of the medium, and an inspiring preface by DailyCandy's Sujean Rim, this is the guide to a beautiful revolution.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc70e3c16d79c6fc87eff9803466ac879f47c5be","amp;dn":"Watercolor+-Rim-+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Epub_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc70e3c16d79c6fc87eff9803466ac879f47c5be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,112,227,193,109,121,198,252,135,239,249,128,52,102,172,135,159,71,197,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
