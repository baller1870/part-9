Frith, Kathryn Mullen, Paul Jacobs, Sarah Durkee, Judy Freudberg &amp; Tony Geiss, as well as Tom Whedon (the head writer of the 1970s Electric Company series). The show is a co-production between WGBH in Boston and Sirius Thinking, Ltd., in New York City, in association with Mississippi Public Broadcasting, in Mississippi. The show has won seven Daytime Emmy awards. \n\nThese were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off my local PBS station. I had posted them to Demonoid previously, but since that site may be gone permanently I decided to share them here.\n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. If people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05fe2bb5c8f93de717896bd4d125bb1d2f2f5e4f","amp;dn":"Between+the+Lions+%28PBS+Kids%29+Season+07%2C+Episodes+01-02%2C+04-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05fe2bb5c8f93de717896bd4d125bb1d2f2f5e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,254,43,181,200,249,61,231,23,137,107,212,209,37,187,29,47,47,94,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
