Although hardly his dream job, Robert sees the position of temporary village constable as a necessary stage on the road to rehabilitation. He just needs to do well and generally behave by the book. However, village life and the macabre provincial order don't fit easily into Robert's plans. Nothing is ever straightforward, and certainly not when you are way out in the country.\n\nThis very dark comedy is very strange and bizzare, in a Coen Bros / Hitchcock sorta way. Set in a rural Danish outback, this police drama-mystery-noir is a top notch production with great story and character development -- in a understated, strange way. Very well directed, produced, acted and photographed.\n\nI don't know how to describe the twists and turns this one has -- it's spot on and off beat. You just *never* know what to expect next.\n\nThis was a fantastic film all the way through. If you are a fan of the Coen Brothers work then you will enjoy this I'm sure.\n\nIMDb RATING: 7.0/10 (1,355 votes)\n\nRun Time: 99 minutes\nLanguage: Danish\nSubtitles: English Hard Coded\n\ncredit Infectious (JDPennington) BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/86884775410156027045.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/86884775410156027045.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66557460941147061760.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/66557460941147061760.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/37222928232110071531.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/37222928232110071531.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73222689232109432748.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/73222689232109432748.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2010ff82bcf81e6806a4c51234486a8a81ae24ae","amp;dn":"Terribly+Happy+%28Frygtelig+lykkelig%29+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG%5BExtraTorren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2010ff82bcf81e6806a4c51234486a8a81ae24ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,16,255,130,188,248,30,104,6,164,197,18,52,72,106,138,129,174,36,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
