It was recorded in various studios including Detroit, Michigan, Los Angeles, California and Burbank, California. Minaj enlisted a variety of producers including Bangladesh, Blackout Movement, Drew Money, Oak, Papa Justifi, J. R. Rotem, Swizz Beatz, T-Minus and will.i.am. Its music incorporates hip hop, R&amp;B, and pop styles.[1][2] It features guest vocals from Eminem, Rihanna, Drake, will.i.am, Kanye West and Natasha Bedingfield.  The album was promoted with eight singles, including international hits &quot;Super Bass&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;, and US Billboard Hot 100 hits &quot;Your Love&quot;, &quot;Right Thru Me&quot;, and &quot;Moment 4 Life&quot;. Minaj also supported the album with a five-date promotional concert tour during October 2010.  After a much anticipated release as the result of Minaj's extensive featured appearances on the singles of other artists, Pink Friday debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 selling 375,000 copies in its first week.[3] It ultimately reached number one and spent 73 consecutive weeks on the chart.[4] As of July 2013, it has sold 1,895,000 copies in the United States.[5] The album also charted within the top 20 in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The album garnered Minaj three Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist, Best Rap Performance for &quot;Moment 4 Life&quot; featuring Drake and a Best Rap Album nomination for Pink Friday at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012..\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] I'm The Best\n[02] Roman's Revenge - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring Eminem\n[03] Did It On'em\n[04] Right Thru Me\n[05] Fly - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring Rihanna\n[06] Save Me\n[07] Moment 4 Life - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring Drake\n[08] Check It Out - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring will.i.am\n[09] Blazin' - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring Kanye West\n[10] Here I Am\n[11] Dear Old Nicki\n[12] Your Love\n[13] Last Chance - - - Nicki Minaj Featuring Natasha Bedingfield\n[14] Girls Fall Like Dominoes\n[15] Super Bass\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:58m:03s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 144mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
