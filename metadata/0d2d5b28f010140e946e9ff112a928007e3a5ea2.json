Philip Roth concentrates on five episodes from his life: his secure \ncity childhood in the thirties and forties; his education in American life \nat a conventional college in the fifties; his passionate entanglement, as an \nambitious young man, with the angriest person he ever met (the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgirl of my \ndreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Roth calls her); his clash, as a fledgling writer, with a Jewish \nestablishment outraged by Goodbye, Columbus; and his discovery, in the \nexcesses of the sixties, of an unmined side to his talent that led him to \nwrite PortnoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Complaint. The audiobook concludes surprisingly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in true \nRothian fashion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a sustained assault by the novelist against his \nproficiencies as an autobiographer.    \n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nA book by Philip Roth that traces his life from his childhood in Newark, \nNew Jersey to becoming a successful, widely respected novelist. The \nautobiographical section is bookended by two letters, one from Roth to his \nfictional alter-ego Nathan Zuckerman, the other from Zuckerman himself, \ntelling Roth what he sees as problems with the book.\n\nRoth interlaces the present with the past and remote past. \nThe book is divided into six chapters:\n\n &quot;Prologue&quot; (About his father)\n &quot;Safe at Home&quot; (Growing up in a Jewish neighborhood)\n &quot;Joe College&quot; (College life, first love)\n &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot; (Chicago years, the woman who became his first wife)\n &quot;All in the Family&quot; (Defending against Jewish community attacks on his writing)\n &quot;Now Vee May Perhaps to Begin&quot; (His divorce and death of his first wife)\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\nBy offering his memoirs plus a critique of same penned by his alter ego Nathan \nZuckerman, Roth here undermines the autobiographical genre as he derailed \nfictional conventions in The Counterlife. Roth lays bare his private lifeor \nobscures the really juicy parts because, as Zuckerman says, autobiography may \nindeed be &quot;the most manipulative of all literary forms.&quot; He also manages to \nbeat those nasty book reviewers to the punch, because Zuckerman is the first \nto recognize that &quot;this isn't you at your most interesting.&quot; Bathed here in a \nquasi-nostalgic glow, the writer's youth and college years are pretty tame; \nRoth is smart, loquacious but quite the good Jewish boy. The book becomes much \nmore energetic and absorbing when Roth describes his self-destructive \nrelationship with &quot;Josie,&quot; a woman who bought a urine specimen from a pregnant \nblack stranger in a park in order to bully Roth into marrying her (which he \ndoes after insisting on an abortion), and whom Roth calls &quot;the greatest \ncreative-writing teacher of them all, specialist par excellence in the \naesthetics of extremist fiction.&quot; \n\nAnother unlikely font for his imagination was the Jewish community; the uproar \nover Goodbye, Columbus helped to fuel Portnoy's Complaint and the Zuckerman \nseries. Despite their weaknesses, these reflections would stand even on their \nown as perspicacious insights by a past master of fiction on a writer's \nbeginnings, quest for freedom and creative muses. With the Zuckerman add-on, \nthe book becomes a unique demonstration of the superiority of fiction over \nautobiography as an uninhibited, introspective, self-confrontive form.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2d5b28f010140e946e9ff112a928007e3a5ea2","amp;dn":"THE+FACTS+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+Mel+Foster+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2d5b28f010140e946e9ff112a928007e3a5ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,45,91,40,240,16,20,14,148,110,159,241,18,169,40,0,126,58,94,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
