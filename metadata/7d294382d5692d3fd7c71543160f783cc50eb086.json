American style.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270490/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270490/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.trashedmovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.trashedmovie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrashedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a provocative investigation of one of the fastest growing industries in North America. The garbage business. The film examines a fundamental element of modern American cultureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the disposal of what our society defines as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwaste.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It is an issue influenced by every American, most of whom never consider the consequences. Nor, it seems, the implications to our biosphere. At times humorous, but deeply poignant, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrashedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ examines the American waste stream fast approaching a half billion tons annually.\n\nWhat are the effects all this waste will have on already strained natural resources? Why is so much of it produced? While every American creates almost 5 pounds of it every day, who is affected most? And who wants America to make more?\n\nThe film analyzes the causes and effects of the seemingly innocuous act of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtaking out the garbageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while showcasing the individuals, activists,corporate and advocacy groups working to affect change and reform the current model. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrashedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is an informative and thought-provoking film everyone interested in the future of sustainability should see. \n\nVideo: Xvid 512x384 29.97fps 1511Kbps [Video 0]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 105Kbps [Audio 1]\nRuntime: 00:59:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d294382d5692d3fd7c71543160f783cc50eb086","amp;dn":"Trashed.%282007%29.DvDrip.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d294382d5692d3fd7c71543160f783cc50eb086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,41,67,130,213,105,45,63,215,199,21,67,22,15,120,60,197,14,176,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
