DICK! Garson Poole had a pretty great life: good job, nice apartment, a sexy, fl irtatious assistant. And then he wakesup in a hospital room...the doctors inform him that he's been in a car accident...and they can't treat him. Because he's a robot. Specifi cally, Garson is an Electric Ant, a human-like robot created and programmed to serve a specific function. But what is Garson's function? How will his friends and co-workers treat him, knowing that he's a machine, and not a person? And how much of his world is real, and how much of it is part of his programming? Written by Kabuki scribe David Mack and illustrated by Pascal Alixe (Eternals Annual).&quot;\n\nThere is no scanner listed on this copy.
