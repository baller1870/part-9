Neutrino experiments and particle accelerators where different particles have been discovered are reviewed. In particular, details about the CERN accelerators are presented. This book also discusses the future developments of the field and the work to popularize high energy physics. A short presentation of some features of astrophysics and its connection to particle physics is also included. At the end of the book, some useful tools in the research of particle physics are given for the advanced readers.\r\n\r\nReadership: University students, researchers and general public interested in the history and developments of particle physics.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nBorn on 17 September, 1951 at Antsakabary, Majunga (Madagascar)\r\nMarried, 2 children, 1 grandchild\r\nStephan Narison is, presently, Director of Research 1st class at the Laboratory Universe and Particles of Montpellier (LUPM) attached to the CNRS-IN2P3 and the University of Montpellier 2, France.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nForeword vii\r\nOutline xi\r\nI General Introduction 1\r\n1 Evolution of Physical Sciences 3\r\n2 Anatomy of the Universe 35\r\n3 Basics of Particle Physics 43\r\nII Modern Theories of Forces 57\r\n4 Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) 59\r\n5 Pre-QCDEra 71\r\n6 Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) 85\r\n7 Electroweak Standard Model 123\r\nIII Higgs Boson Discovery and Beyond 147\r\n8 Higgs Boson Discovery 149\r\n9 The Era After Higgs 165\r\nIV Experiments to Go Back in Time 181\r\n10 High-Energy Colliders 183\r\n11 Fishing the Invisible Neutrinos 195\r\nV A Brief Cosmos Tour 209\r\n12 General Relativity and Gravitation 211\r\n13 The Minimal Big Bang Model 215\r\n14 Beyond the Minimal Big Bang Model 225\r\n15 Excursion to the Infinitely Large 229\r\nVI Fundamental Researches and Society 241\r\n16 International Research Centers 243\r\n17 Popularizing High-Energy Physics 249\r\nVII Epilogue 261\r\nVIII Appendix: Useful Notes for Advanced Readers 267\r\nA Special and General Relativity 269\r\nB Quantum Mechanics â€” Field Theory 273\r\nC SU(N) Lie Algebra 285\r\nD Gauge Theory 289\r\nE Kits for Feynman Diagrams Calculus 315\r\nIX Annex 329\r\nX Bibliography and Index 341\r\nXI About the Author 361\r\n \nhttp://s15.postimg.org/e2o2nuluj/Particles_and_the_Universe.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c82b39492fbc0bc6096ec43114569e537c7ab8c8","amp;dn":"Particles+and+the+Universe+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c82b39492fbc0bc6096ec43114569e537c7ab8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,43,57,73,47,188,11,198,9,110,196,49,20,86,158,83,124,122,184,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
