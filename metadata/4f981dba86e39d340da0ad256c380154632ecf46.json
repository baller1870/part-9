Armies of the two sides met on the plain of Sekigahara on 21 October 1600, in thick fog and deep mud. By the end of the day 40,000 heads had been taken and Ieyasu was master of Japan. Within three years the Emperor would grant him the title he sought Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shogun. This title describes the campaign leading up to this great battle and examines Sekigahara, including the forces and personalities of the two major sides and that of the turncoat Kobayakawa Hideaki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f981dba86e39d340da0ad256c380154632ecf46","amp;dn":"Sekigahara+1600%3A+The+Final+Struggle+for+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f981dba86e39d340da0ad256c380154632ecf46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,152,29,186,134,227,157,52,13,160,173,37,108,56,1,84,99,46,207,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
