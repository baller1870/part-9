It only contains the full albums as apposed to random singles, remixes, blah blah.\n\nI had to search for a bunch of these albums in a few places, and when I found them their tags where fucked up. I attempted to fix them, so they should be readable in English now.\n\nThe albums in this torrent are:\n\n    * Gagaku (October 31, 2002)\n    * Galyuu (December 2, 2003)\n    * Miyavizm (limited edition) (June 1, 2005)\n    * MYVÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â Pops (August 2, 2006)\n    * Miyaviuta -Dokusou- (September 13, 2006)\n    * This Iz the Japanese Kabuki Rock (March 19, 2008)\n\n\nIn the event I didn't fix the tags correctly, you can just wikipedia the albums and fix them yourselves. If you have to do that, then it is important to note that Miyavizm is the limited edition and two tracks were removed from the original disc and a new one was added.
