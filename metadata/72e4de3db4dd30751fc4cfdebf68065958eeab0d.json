Historians have branded them as four lone wolves. But what if they were wrong?\nBeecher is about to discover the truth: that during the course of a hundred years, all four assassins were secretly working together. What was their purpose? For whom do they really work? And why are they planning to kill the current President? \nBeecher's about to find out. And most terrifyingly, he's about to come face-to-face with the fifth assassin.\n\nFull Retail. ePub only.
