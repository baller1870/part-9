It appeared fuzzy on my PC, but quality improved upon playing on TV.  There is a bit of line artifact in the early part of the film, but clears up quickly.\n\n\nA Pirate Bay exclusive!! (for now).  The *only* copy available as a torrent!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc3915cbe78e7a30a30333cc0754389072ad63f8","amp;dn":"The+Baltimore+Bullet+-+Very+rare+DVD-R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc3915cbe78e7a30a30333cc0754389072ad63f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,57,21,203,231,142,122,48,163,3,51,204,7,84,56,144,114,173,99,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
