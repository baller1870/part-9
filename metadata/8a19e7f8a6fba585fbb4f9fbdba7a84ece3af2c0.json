I t was made in a couple of weeks so donÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if youÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.\n\n\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the .exe file.\n2. Follow the instructions.\n3. Enjoy the program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a19e7f8a6fba585fbb4f9fbdba7a84ece3af2c0","amp;dn":"Goat+Simulator+2014+v1.0.27849+%282-click+run%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a19e7f8a6fba585fbb4f9fbdba7a84ece3af2c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,25,231,248,166,251,165,133,251,180,249,251,219,167,168,78,206,58,242,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
