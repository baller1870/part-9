He receives a message from his employers that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a problem at the station up north, and that since heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there, he should check it out. The problem is &quot;a problem doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even begin to describe it&quot;.\n\nNever mind the tapu, the mysterious death rate, rumours of dragons, conspiracy theories about the global military industrial complex, and the old guy with the gun.\n\nThe town is the future site of &quot;Maoriworld&quot; -- the tourism drawcard thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll put this place on the map (investment enquiries welcomed).\n\nJust donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask too many questions.\n\n\n\nClaybourne was a sci-fi / supernatural thriller / soap opera radio drama, recorded and broadcast nationwide in New Zealand in the late 1990s. A total of 96 shows were produced by Andrew Dubber and Belinda Todd. Produced by Pronoun Productions, Claybourne was made with the assistance of a grant from the NZ Government body 'New Zealand On Air'. It features actors from stage and screen, many of whom are household names in their own country and abroad.\n\nClaybourne was judged &quot;Best Dramatic Production of the Year&quot; in the 1999 New Zealand Radio Awards and has already become one of the most popular spoken word programs in the history of mp3.com.\n\n\n\nmp3 files, complete in 96 parts, total running time 09h17m58s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee95dd514fe5958a45d8d854ead2ea41b321b2c5","amp;dn":"Claybourne+%5BNew+Zealand+Radio+scifi+thriller+drama%5D+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee95dd514fe5958a45d8d854ead2ea41b321b2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,149,221,81,79,229,149,138,69,216,216,84,234,210,234,65,179,33,178,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
