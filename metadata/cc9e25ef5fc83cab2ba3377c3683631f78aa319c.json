Rock and Roll\r\n2. Over The Hills and Far Away\r\n3. Black Dog\r\n4. Misty Mountain Hop\r\n5. Since I've Been Loving You\r\n6. Dancing Days\r\n7. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\r\n8. The Song Remains The Same\r\n9. The Rain Song\r\n10. Dazed and Confused\r\n11. Stairway to Heaven\r\n12. Whole Lotta Love\r\n13. Heartbreaker\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis is the final show of 1972 and the audience is so cool and restrained \r\nthat it is annoying! The show itself is very good though, and the playing \r\nis wonderful and aggressive. &quot;Good evening! A merry 23rd of December! \r\nTonight we've got Father Christmas himself with us - John Bonham! Tin Pan \r\nAlley's answer to Father Christmas!&quot; Plant joking. He seems to be having \r\nslight problems in the beginning but settles down and delivers a good show. \r\nThere are some great solos from Jimmy, especially in Since I've Been Loving \r\nYou, where he is just playing pure, inspired blues from the soul. A restless \r\naudience stops Stairway To Heaven a minute plus into the song. After Plant's \r\nseating instructions, they start the song again: &quot;Listen, I gotta tell you \r\nsomething before you all start shrieking about. First, it is the 23rd \r\nDecember and it is supposed to be the season of goodwill. So, if you all sit \r\ndown, there's people at the back who prefer to sit, 'cos really it's one of \r\nthe hardest numbers to do without a monkey house going crazy!&quot; Moby Dick was \r\ncalling by the member of the audience, which inclinated Plant to answer: \r\n&quot;He doesn't do Moby Dick anymore. He's writing a new one. It's called The \r\nTitanic.&quot; An excellent storming version of Heartbreaker was dedicated by \r\nPlant to Roy Harper, group's friend and fellowship musician","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9e25ef5fc83cab2ba3377c3683631f78aa319c","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1972.12.23+Alexandria+Palace%2C+London+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9e25ef5fc83cab2ba3377c3683631f78aa319c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,158,37,239,95,200,60,171,43,163,55,124,54,131,99,31,120,170,49,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
