Virtually every move is explained using words that everyone can understand. Jargon is avoided as far as possible. Almost all the examples are taken from the 1990s and show how key ideas are handled by the grandmasters of today. The emphasis is on general principles that readers will be able to use in their own games, and detailed analysis is only given where it is necessary. Each game contains many lessons, but to guide the reader through the most important ideas in each phase of the game, the thirty games are grouped thematically into those highlighting opening, middlegame and endgame themes.\n\nAbout the Author\nJohn Nunn is a grandmaster from England. He has won four individual gold medals and three team silver medals at Chess Olympiads. In the Chess World Cup of 1988/9, he finished sixth overall, ahead of several former World Champions. He is arguably the most highly acclaimed chess writer in the world, with two of his books receiving the prestigious British Chess Federation Book of the Year Award.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07efa6ef3061efe5259c42ed4f3485ab9238ce0e","amp;dn":"Understanding+Chess+Move+by+Move","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07efa6ef3061efe5259c42ed4f3485ab9238ce0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,239,166,239,48,97,239,229,37,156,66,237,79,52,133,171,146,56,206,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
