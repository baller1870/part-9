Organized by topicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as research in human factors, learning, thinking, and problem solvingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the text helps you connect the concepts of sound methodology with their practical applications. Because the authors use dozens of carefully selected real-world examples, you can see for yourself the issues and problems that can occur in conducting research. More importantly, you can develop a sense of how to anticipate and adjust for problems in your own research.\nBiography\n\nBarry H.
