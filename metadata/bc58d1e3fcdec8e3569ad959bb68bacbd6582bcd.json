In Lessons 1 and 2, you will learn widely applicable design principles and techniques like high-level UX planning and user-centered design.\nIn Lessons 3 and 4, you will focus on design ideas specific to mobile/Android development. Mobile platforms all come with a unique set of constraints and opportunities and this lesson will help you respect those constraints while taking advantage of the opportunities.\n\nLessons\n\nLESSON 1: WHAT IS USER EXPERIENCE?\nIn this lesson you will think about User Experience from the highest level. You will break down complex apps into a small number of simple steps and think about their big picture flow (including ones that you have worked on in the past or are currently working on).\nTopics covered:\n\tWhat is UX?\n\tUI vs. UX\n\tHigh-level planning\n\tLow-fi wireframing and prototyping\n\tTwo concrete app improvements to implement now\n\t\nLESSON 2: USER-CENTERED DESIGN\nIn this lesson you will learn how to design apps that your users will love. You will learn the importance of user-centered design, what happens when you design for everyone/no one (spoiler alert: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s generally bad), and how to effectively use tools like personas and use cases to ensure a baseline level of quality for anything you build. You will also learn a bit about how to use cheap and easy user research techniques to make well-informed design decisions.\nTopics covered:\n\tThe perils of ignoring your user\n\tHow to create effective personas and use cases\n\tLow cost user research\n\tHow to use personas and use cases to inform feature lists\n\t\nLESSON 3: DESIGNING FOR MOBILE CONSTRAINTS\nMobile design and development come with constraints and opportunities. This lesson is about the constraints. You will learn what constraints are inherent to mobile development and how to use design tools and techniques to ensure your app actually respects those constraints.\nTopics covered:\n\tThe 5 big constraints: limited data, finite battery, hand-held usage, divided user attention, and small screens.\n\tThe implications of these constraints and what happens when you get them wrong.\n\tAdvanced wireframing\n\t\nLESSON 4: DESIGNING FOR ANDROID DELIGHT\nAt this point, you will already know how to make a solid mobile app that users like. But like isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough! In order to be really successful, your app needs to be loved. In this lesson, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to leverage the power of Android by using device sensors and Google APIs to understand your userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s context.\nTopics covered:\n\tAndroid sensors\n\tThe importance of contextual apps\n\tThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“componentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of context\n\tAndroid APIs (Google Play Services)\n\t\nFinal Project\nIn your final project, you will create high/mid-level design specifications for your own incredible Android app. You'll begin work on this project in the Assignments for Lesson 2, and continue working on it until the end of the course.\nWhen it's finished, you will have the blueprint for an app that will:\n\tBe designed for a specific target user.\n\tHave an almost-perfect high level flow.\n\tAvoid all major mobile pitfalls.\n\tUse Android sensors and APIs to understand your user's context and deliver context-aware moments of amazement that they will love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc58d1e3fcdec8e3569ad959bb68bacbd6582bcd","amp;dn":"UX+Design+for+Mobile+Developers+-+By+Udacity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc58d1e3fcdec8e3569ad959bb68bacbd6582bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,88,209,227,252,222,200,227,86,154,217,89,187,104,186,203,214,88,43,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
