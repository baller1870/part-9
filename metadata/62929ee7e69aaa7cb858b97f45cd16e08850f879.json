When Klaatu finds himself faced with hawkish, uncompromising officials, he goes on the run with Benson and her son as the fate of the world gradually becomes clear.\n\n\n\nwww.torrengine.com\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62929ee7e69aaa7cb858b97f45cd16e08850f879","amp;dn":"The+Day+The+Earth+Stood+Still+%282008%29+DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62929ee7e69aaa7cb858b97f45cd16e08850f879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,146,158,231,230,154,170,124,184,88,185,127,69,205,22,224,136,80,248,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
