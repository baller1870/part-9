It also introduced Clouseau&amp;#039;s boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), and Kato (Bert Kwouk), both of whom became fixtures throughout the rest of the series. On the other hand, it continues with the pink panther animation and the Henry Mancini theme from &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, despite the fact that this is the only film in the series that doesn&amp;#039;t have &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; in the title. Nor is the mythical diamond in the plot.\n  A chauffer in a wealthy household is shot dead in a room belonging to a maid. The maid is found with the gun in her hand. Clouseau, mistakenly assigned to the case, is smitten by the maid (Elke Sommer) and is determined to prove her innocent. A madcap caper with a surprise ending ensues.\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, Elke Sommer, George Sanders, Herbert Lom, Bert Kwouk.\n\n  Directed by: Blake Edwards.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 42min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  336\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a875deed9d8e6aa73f263cd9495f24ff94854e","amp;dn":"A+Shot+in+the+Dark+%281964%29+%28Peter+Sellers%2C+Elke+Sommer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a875deed9d8e6aa73f263cd9495f24ff94854e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,168,117,222,237,157,142,106,167,63,38,60,217,73,95,36,255,148,133,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
