But Lythe was once the heart of an Elizabethan feudal estate and home to a young English tutor named William Shakespeare, and as Isobel investigates the strange history of her family, her neighbors, and her village, she occasionally gets caught in Shakespearean time warps. Meanwhile, she gets closer to the shocking truths about her missing mother, her war-hero father, and the hidden lives of her close friends and classmates. A stunning feat of imagination and storytelling, Kate Atkinson's Human Croquet is rich with the disappointments and possibilities every family shares. - Goodreads Summary\n\nNote: For a young adult to older audience, and is recommendable to those who enjoyed &quot;Stone Diaries&quot; by Carol Shields, who enjoy quick-witted humor and who enjoy the complications of a storyline.\n\nCompatibility: Most eReaders\n\nCovers: Yes\n\nMetadata: Yes\n\nAny requests?
