At number 18, here is The Dream Academy with, 'Life In A Northern Town'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThere is a song by a woman whose first hit 25 years prior came out in two different versions, on two different labels, and both versions debuted on the hot 100 in the same week. Casey explains.\n\nCasey lists the acts which have had the most top 40 hits without ever hitting number 1. The prize-winning act has its 20th top 40 song in this countdown.\n\nRight before the song &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; (by Baltimora, at number 25) Casey tells how real-life Tarzan Johnny Weissmuller once got kidnapped by real Cuban Guerrillas and got free because, well, he was Tarzan.\n\nIn the history of the chart, only three Austrian acts have ever made the top 40. The first was Lolita with her song &quot;Sailor, Your Home is the Sea&quot; in 1960. The other two are in this countdown: The band called Opus at number 38 with their song, &quot;Live Is Life&quot; and Falco at number 7 with &quot;Rock Me Amadeus.&quot;\n\nA listener wants to know if any act has been able to hit the top 10 in the 50's, the 60's, the 70's, and the 80's. Casey says not the top 10, but five men have been able to hit the top 40 in all four decades and gives the details.\n\n40: West End Girls - Pet Shop Boys\n39: I Think It's Love - Jermaine Jackson\n38: Live Is Life - Opus\n37: That's What Friends Are For - Dionne Warwick\n36: I'm Not The One - The Cars\nLDD: If Ever You're In My Arms Again - Peabo Bryson\n35: I Can't Wait - Stevie Nicks\n34: Goodbye Is Forever - Arcadia\n33: Calling America - Electric Light Orchestra\n32: Addicted To Love - Robert Palmer\n31: No Easy Way Out - Robert Tepper\n30: Night Moves - Marilyn Martin\n29: Tender Love - Force MD's\nLDD: Wake Me Up Before You Gogo - Wham\n28: Day By Day - The Hooters\n27: A Love Bazaar - Sheila E\n26: Stages - ZZ Top\n25: Tarzan Boy - Baltimora\n24: Another Night - Aretha Franklin\n23: How To Be A Millionaire - ABC\n22: Russians - Sting\n21: When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going - Billy Ocean\n20: Beat's So Lonely - Charlie Sexton\n19: Manic Monday - The Bangles\n18: Life In A Northern Town - The Dream Academy\n17: Living In America - James Brown\n16: Let's Go All The Way - Sly Fox\n15: Kiss - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n14: Sanctify Yourself - Simple Minds\n13: Sweetest Taboo - Sade\n12: This Could Be The Night - Loverboy\n11: What You Need - INXS\n10: Nikita - Elton John\n9: King For A Day - The Thompson Twins\n8: Silent Running - Mike &amp; The Mechanics\n7: Rock Me Amadeus - Falco\n6: R.O.C.K.
