A PowerÃ‚Â­ Vinyasa class, focus is on cardio and strength training, as well as detoxification, super sweaty flow, balancing postures, and twists.\n\nGet your heart pumping and your energy up as you work your organs via a series of twists. Twists are a fundamental part of yoga practice, and allow you to Ã¢â‚¬Å“wring outÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ your organs. The postures cut off the flow of blood to the digestive organs, and introduce fresh blood (and therefore fresh nutrients and oxygen) to the organs once the twist is released. Fresh blood aids the cells in the cleansing of builtÃ‚Â­up waste among other fabulous benefits.\n\nTwists also allow you to activate the spine and therefore maintain normal rotation, while also reducing any back pain and general stress. Join Lauren on this powerful, twistÃ‚Â­tastic journey....your organs and spine will love it!\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Cardio, Detox, Strength, Balancing Poses, Super Sweaty Flow, Twists\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c001bae101be3f37b78d4e476286a838976860e","amp;dn":"Lauren+Eckstrom+Yoga+-+Twist+and+Detox+30+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c001bae101be3f37b78d4e476286a838976860e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,0,27,174,16,27,227,243,123,120,212,228,118,40,106,131,137,118,134,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
