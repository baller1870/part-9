Occupying a precarious middle ground between the Jewish citizens of Israel and the dispossessed Palestinians of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Israeli Palestinians have developed an exceedingly complex relationship with the land they call home; however, in the innumerable discussions of the Israel-Palestine problem, their experiences are often overlooked and forgotten.\nIn this book, historian Ilan PappÃƒÂ© examines how Israeli Palestinians have fared under Jewish rule and what their lives tell us about both Israel's attitude toward minorities and Palestinians' attitudes toward the Jewish state. Drawing upon significant archival and interview material, PappÃƒÂ© analyzes the Israeli state's policy towards its Palestinian citizens, finding discrimination in matters of housing, education, and civil rights. Rigorously researched yet highly readable, The Forgotten Palestinians brings a new and much-needed perspective to the Israel-Palestine debate.\n\nReviews\n&quot;The Forgotten Palestinians strings together fragments, events, documents, and interviews into a coherent and convincing narrative in a way that will certainly lend itself to advancing future studies. In this way, PappÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s book is also a cornerstone study, and one that will certainly produce many more in the same tradition, making this book both overdue and timely.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Ryvka Barnard, Arab Studies Journal\n\n&quot;. . . an essential contribution.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Magid Shihade, Journal of Palestine Studies\n\nAbout the Author\nThe best selling author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, Ilan PappÃƒÂ© is currently Professor of History at Exeter University, UK, and previously taught at Haifa University, Israel.
