SAVE ME, SAN FRANCISCO took four years to make -- remember there was Monahan's solo album in the interim -- and involved a slew of musicians (because only Monahan, guitarist Jimmy Stafford, and drummer Scott Underwood remain from the original group), four studios in the United States and England, songwriting collaborators, and even a handful of producers, though Martin Terefe gets the final credit. The truth is it's a very focused record, centering around the theme of a wandering young rocker who falls in love and wants to settle down. Ultimately however, SAVE ME, SAN FRANCISCO is a love song to the band's hometown.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d1db9b1155ffd85b464fb0edc8dea65de6317e","amp;dn":"Train...Save+Me%2C+San+Francisco%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d1db9b1155ffd85b464fb0edc8dea65de6317e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,209,219,155,17,85,255,216,91,70,79,176,237,200,222,166,93,230,49,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
