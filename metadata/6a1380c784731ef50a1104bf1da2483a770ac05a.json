Android has always been a natural fit with Arduino projects, but now that Google has released the Android Open Accessory Development Kit (the Android ADK), combining Android with Arduino to create custom gadgets has become even easier. Beginning Android ADK with Arduino shows how the ADK works and how it can be used with a variety of Arduino boards to create a variety of fun projects that showcase the abilities of the ADK. Mario BÃƒÂ¶hmer will walk you through several projects, including making sounds, driving motors, and creating alarm systems, all while explaining how to use the ADK and how standard Arduino boards may differ from Google-branded Arduinos. You aren't tied to specific hardware with this book; use what you have, and this book will show you how. What youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn How different boards work with the ADK How to create your first sketch and project How to work with light and sound How to work with servos and DC motors How to work with photoresistors and thermistors to sense the environment How to make your own capacitive touch game show buzzer How to create your own camera-enabled alarm system Who this book is for This book is for beginning Arduino and Android enthusiasts, or Arduino developers who want to try out the new Android ADK.
