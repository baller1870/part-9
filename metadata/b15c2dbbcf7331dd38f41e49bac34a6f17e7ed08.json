However, there is much, much more to working with textures than simply merging them with an image via Photoshop. In this gorgeous new guide from texture guru Sarah Gardner, you'll learn everything there is to know about how to maximize the potential of these exciting tools. In addition to hundreds of beautiful example images, this book is also packed with practical advice on what makes a good texture, and how and when to use them. How an image is initially captured and processed has a significant impact on the effect a texture will have, so you'll also learn what to consider when composing and shooting (rather than simply relying on post-processing) and how to use lighting and background considerations effectively for later work with textures. Workshop notes and a supplemental website will help you put Sarah's techniques into practice immediately. Beautiful enough to sit on your coffee table yet practical enough to store near your computer, this book will show you everything you need to know to get that coveted vintage-feel in your images, whether you're a casual family snapper or a seasoned professional","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15c2dbbcf7331dd38f41e49bac34a6f17e7ed08","amp;dn":"Art+Beyond+the+Lens+-+Working+with+Digital+Textures+%282012%29Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15c2dbbcf7331dd38f41e49bac34a6f17e7ed08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,92,45,187,207,115,49,221,56,244,30,73,186,195,74,111,23,231,237,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
