In addition, new chapters have been added on John Zorn, jazz in the 1990s and beyond, samplers, the tuba, the harmonica, non-Western instruments, postmodernist and repertory big bands, how the avant-garde has explored tradition, and many other subjects.\n \nWith a widespread resurgence of interest in jazz, The Jazz Book will continue well into the 21st century to fill the need for information about an art form widely regarded as AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest contribution to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef5e53d87c974cf734de02d04bc69fa1a3912d0","amp;dn":"The+Jazz+Book%3A+From+Ragtime+to+the+21st+Century+-Berndt-+PDF+%5BSl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ef5e53d87c974cf734de02d04bc69fa1a3912d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,245,229,61,135,201,116,207,115,77,224,45,4,188,105,250,26,57,18,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
