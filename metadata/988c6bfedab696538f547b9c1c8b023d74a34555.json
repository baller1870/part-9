please do not bitch about tags, bitrates, or otherwise - they are good quality. i spent enough time putting these discs together and normalizing the volume throughout. most, if not all, should ring familiar with everyone. these are some of the most popular songs from the 80s out there... that was then - i was there! there are 100MB of space left for you to play with on each disc... i know that there are definitely some more that could be here and some may think that a few should not. these DO cover a fairly wide range -    ENJOY\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n(CD1)Adam Ant                - Goody Two Shoes \n     Aha                     - Take On Me \n     Alan Parsons Project    -
