Ever read a great quote and think I could never come up with anything that clever?   \n \nDaunting as it may seem, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing mystical about witcraft.  Crafting memorable lines doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require DNA-encoded brilliance. What it does require is some knowledge of the tricks and techniques that make words stick. \n \nIn Word Hero, Jay Heinrichs rescues the how-to of verbal artistry from cobwebbed textbooks and makes it entirely fresh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even a little mischievous.  Fear not: on offer here are not dry, abstract ideas couched in academic jargon.  Rather, Heinrichs takes you on an amusing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and amazingly helpful Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tour of the mechanisms that make powerful language work.  YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to slyly plant your words in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heads and draw indelible verbal pictures by employing such tools as Ã¢â‚¬Å“crashing symbols,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“rapid repeaters,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russian DollsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and even the powers of Mr. Potato Head.\n \nWith those tools and others tucked in your utility belt, you might not immediately achieve Ã¢â‚¬Å“wordsmith immortalityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but you will become a better speaker, writer, and raconteurÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and long after people have forgotten everything else, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll remember your priceless lines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:441241baaa74a8e66d9cc1d5a6a722476e5c5114","amp;dn":"Word+Hero%3A+A+Fiendishly+Clever+Guide+to+Crafting+the+Lines+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"441241baaa74a8e66d9cc1d5a6a722476e5c5114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,18,65,186,170,116,168,230,109,156,193,213,166,167,34,71,110,92,81,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
