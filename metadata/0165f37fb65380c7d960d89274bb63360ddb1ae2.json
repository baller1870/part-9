And what does he have to do with the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nOn paper, MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking too good these days, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.\n\nWhat was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceÃ¢â‚¬â€especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. And the Racketeer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born yesterday . . .\n\nNothing is as it seems and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
