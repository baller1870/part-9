The relationship he has with his team is hilarious but serious. All the stereotypical Italian nuances you might have learned about in America are born and bred here and are obviously authentic. The funniest person on the show is the clerk, his name starts with a C, Campellini or something like that. He is an Italian Kramer (Seinfeld). The best show with the clerk is the one where he shoots the bad guy, whom he catches while taking a pee on a sting. I've seen Luca in other films, which I have tried to find on Netflix, but hands down this is the best role for him and the one that turns him into a huge sex symbol - for me and all his fans on Facebook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67af4472606a5d149d9a74244123201e9131a58a","amp;dn":"Inspector+Montalbano+-+Episodes+1+to+10+-+1999-2002+-+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67af4472606a5d149d9a74244123201e9131a58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,175,68,114,96,106,93,20,157,154,116,36,65,35,32,30,145,49,165,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
