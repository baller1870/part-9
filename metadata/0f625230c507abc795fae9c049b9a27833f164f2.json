David Baker describes the origin of the reusable launch vehicle concept during the 1960s, its evolution into a viable flying machine in the early 1970s, and its subsequent design, engineering, construction, and operation. The ShuttleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s internal layout and systems are explained, including the operation of life support, electrical-power production, cooling, propulsion, flight control, communications, landing, and avionics systems.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 160 pages\n    * Publisher: Zenith Press; First edition (April 18, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0760340765\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0760340769\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f625230c507abc795fae9c049b9a27833f164f2","amp;dn":"NASA+Space+Shuttle%3AOwners+Workshop+Manual%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f625230c507abc795fae9c049b9a27833f164f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,98,82,48,197,7,171,199,149,250,233,192,73,185,162,120,51,241,100,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
