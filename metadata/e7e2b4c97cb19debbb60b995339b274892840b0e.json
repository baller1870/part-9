Now you can take your file sharing to the next level with MacDrive Pro. For over 15 years, MacDrive has enabled PC users to access Mac disks in Windows. MacDrive Pro includes all of MacDrive StandardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s features, including fast and reliable control of all your Mac disks. You can open, edit, save and even format, partition and repair Mac disks. MacDrive Pro builds on MacDriveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard features and gives you more power and more tools to get your work done faster and easier.\n\nAccess Apple RAID sets\nFor the first time ever, Windows users can access Apple RAID sets straight from their PC. Professionals and power users who need improved performance and reliability have used Apple RAID for years, and now with MacDrive Pro, those disks can be shared with Windows. MacDrive Pro opens up a whole new realm of cross-platform computing.\n\nFaster than ever\nMacDrive has always placed a high priority on speed and compatibility. MacDrive is now even faster and more configurable, giving you the ability to fine-tune MacDrive for your workload. Increased speed means you get your work done fasterÃ¢â‚¬â€saving you time and money.\n\nFormat, Partition, Repair\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve streamlined the Mac Disk Manager, making it even easier to format and partition your Mac disks and hard drives. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve even improved MacDriveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repair disk feature, so your data is safer than ever.\n\nBurn Mac-formatted CDs and DVDs\nAlong with the ability to format Mac disks from your PC, you can use MacDriveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CD/DVD Creator to burn Mac CDs and DVDs with ease.\n\nQuick Start Launcher\nMacDrive has always been a simple, seamless utility for sharing files between Mac disks and Windows. MacDrive 9 makes it even easier with Quick Start. Now youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just a click away from all of MacDriveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s features.\n\nSecurity and Optimization\nMacDrive Pro works hard to protect your dataÃ¢â‚¬â€even when you want to delete it. The new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secure DeleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option completely wipes the files from your Mac disk so they cannot be recovered.\n\nAlong with security, speed has always been a hallmark of MacDrive. The best way to increase speed is to have a clean disk. MacDrive Pro takes this a step further with the new built-in auto defrag that constantly optimizes your files to keep them lean and mean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7e2b4c97cb19debbb60b995339b274892840b0e","amp;dn":"MacDrive+Pro+9.0.3.35","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7e2b4c97cb19debbb60b995339b274892840b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,226,180,201,124,177,157,235,187,96,185,149,51,155,39,72,146,132,11,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
