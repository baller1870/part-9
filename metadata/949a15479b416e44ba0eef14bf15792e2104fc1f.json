She has plans. Big ones. And a ton of ambition. It's a combination that's going to get her killed one day - but not just yet.\n\nThat is, until she gets a job on a tiny trade ship with a nasty reputation for surprises. The Glorious Fool isn't misnamed; it likes to get into trouble, so much so that one year of security work under its captain is equal to five years everywhere else. With odds like that, Devi knows she's found the perfect way to get the jump on the next part of her plan. But the Fool doesn't give up its secrets without a fight, and one year on this ship might be more than even Devi can handle.\n\n&quot;Rollicking space opera starring a tough, sexy, armor-clad space chick...Lots of fun.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus\n\n&quot;Bach makes her SF debut with this series launch that introduces a strong female heroine whose mind is mostly on her career -- and her high-tech suit of armor -- yet who finds herself inexplicably drawn into a relationship that could damage her life and her honor. Fans of Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series and David Weber's Honor Harrington novels should enjoy starting another potentially long-running SF military saga.Ã¢â‚¬â€Library Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949a15479b416e44ba0eef14bf15792e2104fc1f","amp;dn":"Rachel+Bach+-+Fortune%27s+Pawn+%28Paradox+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949a15479b416e44ba0eef14bf15792e2104fc1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,154,21,71,155,65,110,68,186,14,239,20,191,21,121,46,33,4,252,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
