BBC Two broadcast the series in 2001.\n\nDr. Terrible's House of Horrible spoofs the British horror films of Amicus Productions, Hammer Film Productions, and Tigon British Film Productions. The title parodies Amicus Productions' anthology film Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965).\n\nHorror film veterans Honor Blackman, Graham Crowden, Sheila Keith, and Angela Pleasence each guest-starred in an episode, in a pastiche of their earlier film performances. Mark Gatiss, John Thomson, Simon Pegg, Ronni Ancona, and Warwick Davis also performed in the series.\n\nSteve Coogan presents each episode as Dr. Terrible, and plays various roles throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81efe9d85e721d672a26d2b69ed10e2db2234fd5","amp;dn":"Dr.Terribles+House+Of+Horrible+S01%2B+Extras+DVDRip+XviD-mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81efe9d85e721d672a26d2b69ed10e2db2234fd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,239,233,216,94,114,29,103,42,38,210,182,158,209,14,45,178,35,79,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
