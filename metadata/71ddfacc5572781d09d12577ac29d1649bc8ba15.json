But each one of them is seriously all that. Its like you can almost feel what they guys in After 7 are singing about. I still remember hearing &quot;Cant Stop&quot;. I didnt know who it was then. But when i found out. I knew i'd found another great singing group. &quot;One Night&quot; is hot as well as almost every other cut of this standout CD.\n\nI dont care what anyone says. This CD deserves much props and After 7 deserves more recognition for bringing the goods on this CD.\n\nCheck this CD out. You'll wonder why you didnt get it sooner. Those are my words.[/quote]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          After 7 - After 7\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: After 7\nAlbum................: After 7\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1989 08 22\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 67 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
