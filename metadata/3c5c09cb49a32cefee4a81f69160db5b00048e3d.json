Robin and Skip are lovers from the 60s who burned bras and draft cards, dropped acid, and finally dynamited a federal building. Reunited in Detroit after years in prison, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve decided to light the fuse of revolution with a wild bombing spree. But in an Elmore Leonard novel, bombs seldom go off as planned, and before long Robin and Skip have taken more than one explosively wrong turnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and more than one life.\n\n- A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c5c09cb49a32cefee4a81f69160db5b00048e3d","amp;dn":"FREAKY+DEAKY+-+Elmore+Leonard.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c5c09cb49a32cefee4a81f69160db5b00048e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,92,9,203,73,163,44,239,238,74,129,246,145,96,219,91,0,4,142,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
