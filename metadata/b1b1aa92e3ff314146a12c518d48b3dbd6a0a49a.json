Since The game supports only X360 gamepad, then sewed emulator X360 gamepad. Before the game with a shortcut on the office desk run it, then play and enjoy life. Who still has a X360 gamepad, just run the game. Not recommended without a gamepad to play the game, a broken finger, though under the control of enchanted arrows and jump with a bang. When you install a Windows choose the bit and put all the necessary software to avoid problems with the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b1aa92e3ff314146a12c518d48b3dbd6a0a49a","amp;dn":"They+Bleed+Pixels+Collector%27s+Edition+%28ENG%29+%5BRePack%5D+Heather","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b1aa92e3ff314146a12c518d48b3dbd6a0a49a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,177,170,146,227,255,49,65,70,161,44,81,141,72,179,219,214,160,164,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
