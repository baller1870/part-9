It presents a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to reading instruction that reinforces the centrality of the teacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in every aspect of teaching and learning. The authors organize each chapter into seven pillars of evidence-based, effective reading instruction: Teacher Knowledge, Assessment, Evidence-Based Instruction Practices, Response to Intervention, Family and Community Connections, and, new to this edition, Motivation and Engagement, and Technology and New Literacies. The book uses color-coding for each of the seven pillars making navigation of each chapter easy and accessible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082fb61ef758356d6c6c18c37fd8bb2054ca9946","amp;dn":"Teaching+Children+to+Read%2C+6E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082fb61ef758356d6c6c18c37fd8bb2054ca9946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,47,182,30,247,88,53,109,108,108,24,195,127,216,187,32,84,202,153,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
