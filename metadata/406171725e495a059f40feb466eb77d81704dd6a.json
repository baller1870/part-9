On 13 August 1972, Parulkar, along with Malvinder Singh Grewal and Harish Sinhji, escaped from a POW camp in Rawalpindi. \n\nFour Miles to Freedom is their story. Based on interviews with eight Indian fighter pilots who helped prepare the escape and the two who escaped, as well as research into other sources, Four Miles is also the moving, sometimes amusing, account of how twelve fighter pilots from different ranks and backgrounds coped with deprivation, forced intimacy and the pervasive uncertainty of a year in captivity and how they came together to support Parulkars courageous escape plan.\n\nGenre: Nonfiction, General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:406171725e495a059f40feb466eb77d81704dd6a","amp;dn":"Four+Miles+to+Freedom+%3A+Escape+from+a+Pakistani+POW+Camp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"406171725e495a059f40feb466eb77d81704dd6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,97,113,114,94,73,90,5,159,64,254,180,102,235,119,216,23,4,221,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
