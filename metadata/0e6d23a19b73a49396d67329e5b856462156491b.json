Totalling over 6hrs of Classroom and Lab Study.\n\nAs with the first Video Set &quot;Hydrogen Car and Multi-Fuel DVD&quot; (here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3519307 ), this is a great series for technical and, indeed practical knowledge when dealing with these system&amp;#039;s. I would still recommend anyone interested in alternative fuel system&amp;#039;s, to learn and study Stanley A. Meyer&amp;#039;s application of Water as a Fuel source. It is not such a difficult system  to learn and use for everyday use, with most application&amp;#039;s which require a gaseous fuel  source, if one was to take the time to read and understand the technical application&amp;#039;s  dealing with his &quot;Water Fuel Cell&quot; technology.\n\nI hope everyone enjoy&amp;#039;s these recent book&amp;#039;s and video&amp;#039;s dealing with &quot;Water as a Fuel Source&quot; and i especially hope quite a few of you will learn this technology and begin to apply it, not only in your own live&amp;#039;s, but everyone else that you know also.\n\nIt is truely a wonderful system Mr. Meyer&amp;#039;s has come up with, so please sit down and begin to learn and apply this wonderful technology. Sell it, share it, do what ever you will with it, as long as you apply it for the benefit of us all, so we might all try to take back what has been so un-graciously taken away from us, namely our Health, our Freedom and OUR Planet.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nTripled&quot;\n\nElectrochemistry Class Chapters: \n\nVideo Codec: Divx 4/5 \nAudio Codec: MPEG 1/2 - 2 Channel 48000Hz\n\n1\\  CLASS-Introduction.avi =         Video stream: 1730.596 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  41sec\n2\\  CLASS-Glossary.avi =             Video stream: 1800.369 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  55min\n3\\  CLASS-QandA.avi =                Video stream: 1799.880 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  45min\n4\\  CLASS-Fuel_Cell_Components.avi = Video stream: 1799.740 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  81min \n5\\  CLASS-Fuels.avi =                Video stream: 1799.985 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  65min \n6\\  CLASS-More_QandA-=.avi =         Video stream: 1800.215 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  59min \n7\\  CLASS-Demonstration_Unit.avi =   Video stream: 1802.811 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  25min\n8\\  CLASS-Alum_Fuel_Cell-\nDemonstraions-and-5HP_Engine.avi =   Video stream: 1799.493 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  09min\n9\\  CLASS-Hydrogen_Storage.avi =     Video stream: 1796.890 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  22min \n10\\ CLASS-Economics.avi =            Video stream: 1802.095 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  11min\n11\\ CLASS-Mini_Demo-and-Sources.avi= Video stream: 1801.270 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  24min\n12\\ CLASS-Opening_a_Fuel_Cell.avi =  Video stream: 1758.053 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  11min\n\nElectrochemistry Lab Tour:\n\nVideo Codec: Divx4/5\nAudio Codec: MPEG 1/2 - 2 Channel 48000Hz\n\nElectrolysis_Lab_Tour.avi =          Video stream: 1795.521 kbit/s - Audio stream: 224.000 kbit/s  24min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6d23a19b73a49396d67329e5b856462156491b","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Fuel-cell+And+Electrochemistry+Class","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6d23a19b73a49396d67329e5b856462156491b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,109,35,161,155,115,164,147,150,214,115,41,229,184,86,70,33,86,73,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
