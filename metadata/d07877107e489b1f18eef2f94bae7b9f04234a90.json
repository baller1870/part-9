Productions in 2010 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nNazi Collaborators \nThis series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. &quot;How could they have done it?&quot; How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil?\n\n\n\n2)  Pierre Laval \nPierre Laval was a French politician who held several cabinet posts including Foreign Minister and was Prime Minister in 1931-32 and 1935-36. After the Nazis occupied France in 1940, Laval developed a close relationship with Adolf Hitler and proposed that the two countries should collaborate. In 1943 Laval created the Milice. Within six months they were playing the leading role in capturing Jews and left-wing activists and deporting them to Germany. After Liberation (1945), he was arrested, found guilty of high treason, and executed by firing squad. This film tells the story of Laval's rise to power and his relationship with Hitler.He is still one of the most detested men in French history.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1915 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d07877107e489b1f18eef2f94bae7b9f04234a90","amp;dn":"Nazi+Collaborators+02of13+Pierre+Laval+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d07877107e489b1f18eef2f94bae7b9f04234a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,120,119,16,126,72,155,31,24,238,242,249,75,174,123,159,4,35,74,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
