If the USDA dietary guidelinesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½recommending that highly caloric grains and carbohydrates comprise 45 to 65 percent of daily caloric intakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are so healthy, why, he asks, has obesity among Americans been on the upswing? Why has this same diet, endorsed by the American Heart Association, not managed to reduce the incidence of heart disease? And, finally, he asks why mainstream health experts continue to promote the notably unscientific notion of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcalories in/calories outÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as the single focus of weight management? After explaining in laypersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s terms the science that debunks the idea that weight control is a matter of burning more calories than one consumes, Taubes offers an alternative viewpoint: no carbs. While his recommendation to eliminate carbohydrates (grains, fruits, sugars, etc.) from oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s diet is not necessarily a new one, Taubes does present compelling supporting evidence that many, if not all, people should consider at least severely limiting carbohydrates in their diet. --Donna Chavez\n\nAudio book unabridged 32kbps MP3 files and PDF appendix. \nRead by Mike Chamberlain 7hrs 57 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:599236cef1d97beef0488b1c25b015ed2da0a041","amp;dn":"Gary+Taubes+-+2010+-+Why+We+Get+Fat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"599236cef1d97beef0488b1c25b015ed2da0a041","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,146,54,206,241,217,123,238,240,72,139,28,37,176,21,237,45,160,160,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
