As long as there are baby boomers\nroaming the earth, its airy jangle will signify psychedelic innocence and optimism\nrefracted through the peculiar light of mid-'60s Los Angeles. With Roger McGuinn\nleading, the Byrds kicked off American rock history with a merger of Bob Dylan's words and the Beatles' melodic energy. The results are here: &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; &quot;The Bells of Rhymney,&quot; and &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; still jump off the airwaves. The midpoint between Dylan and the Beatles is a one-of-a-kind place, where optimism and innocence still sound smart. --Steve Tignor\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Mr. tambourine man                                   [02:33]\n02.I'll feel A whole lot better                         [02:35]\n03.The bells of rhymney                                 [03:33]\n04.Turn! turn! turn!
