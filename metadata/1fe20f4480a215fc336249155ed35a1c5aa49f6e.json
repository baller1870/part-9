You can't go wrong with American International Pictures. And who better to share the back seat with than Marjoe Gortner, former revivalist who first gained a certain fame in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s when he became the youngest ordained preacher at the age of four, and then outright notoriety in the 1970s when he starred in an Oscar-winning, behind-the-scenes documentary about the lucrative business of Pentecostal preaching. (see Wikipedia for more gory details on Marjoe.)\n\n\nAnd what's the prestigious Ida Lupino doing in this sleaze-fest? Well, everybody's gotta eat, even the rats and worms that attack her!\n\n\nHere's the whole cast, per IMDB:\n\nMarjoe Gortner ... Morgan\nPamela Franklin ... Lorna\nRalph Meeker ... Jack Bensington\nJon Cypher ... Brian\nIda Lupino ... Mrs. Skinner\nJohn McLiam ... Mr. Skinner\nBelinda Balaski ... Rita\nTom Stovall ... Thomas\nChuck Courtney ... Davis\nReg Tunnicliffe ... Ferry Attendant\n\n(That last guy, Reg, also turns up in the credits a few times as a grip and some other behind-the-scenes roles. He probably wears a rat costume or chicken head, too.)\n\nThere's some good miniature work in this movie. No, really!\n\nBiggest gross-out: woman having a baby during the giant rat attack.\n\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name: Food of the Gods Xvid MP3.avi\nFile Size: 831,183,312 bytes\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration: 1:25:56\nVideo Bitrate: 1198kb/s\nBits / Pixel: 0.116\nResolution: 720x480\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\n\n--- Advanced ---\nB-VOP: B-VOP\nQPel:\nGMC:\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nNo of Audio Streams: 1\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 80kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Channel Count: 1\nInterleave: 33ms\nPreload: ms\nAudio alignment: Aligned","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe20f4480a215fc336249155ed35a1c5aa49f6e","amp;dn":"Food+of+the+Gods+%281976%29+Marjoe+Gortner%2C+Ida+Lupino+TVRip+Xvid+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe20f4480a215fc336249155ed35a1c5aa49f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,226,15,68,128,162,21,252,51,98,73,21,94,211,90,28,90,164,159,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
