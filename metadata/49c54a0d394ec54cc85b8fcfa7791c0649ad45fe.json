That said, this is a comprehensive\ncollection of all his greatest and best and even lesser known and most\nimportantly, the crucial additions to a single collection that others have\nbeen content to miss - such as &quot;You gave me a mountain&quot; &quot;Among my souvenirs&quot;\nand other such greatest songs of his singing talents.\n\nEddy Arnold was the most important man of his time in Country music for\nthe meaningfulness of his lyrics for country folk that seek meaning in all it\nis they do and live with.\n\nIf you look to his yearning for an idealism in his style and focus of lyrical\nthemes to support his mindset and justify his existence at the level he felt\nhe could aspire to and be capable of, you'll find it as he does in his songs\n- in the realization that there isn't any shortcut to simply callin it straight\nand seeing it through that way in life. That's why country folk are so special\nin my own books here too! There are some songs he sang which aren't in here \nperhaps, or rather certainly, however with all that's here, we have the essence \nand even a more than generous serving of Eddy Arnold to the point of avoiding \nbelabor with what we can already enjoy enough of I think with this collection as \nit stands.\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\n\n\n\nEddy Arnold -
