Bands like Rush, Genesis and Yes were shortening their songs, writing poppier tunes and actually landing huge hits on the radio. Punk had tried to kill prog, but all it did was convince the bands it was time for a change. Rush had been moving away from their grand epics for a couple of years before they cut Moving Pictures, partially influenced by bands like the Police. Fueled by the hits &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Limelight,&quot; Moving Pictures was a massive smash for Rush. Five of the seven songs are under five minutes, though &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; clocks in at a whopping 11:01. In many ways, this LP represented a commercial peak for the band. MTV hit a few months after it came out, and the group didn't exactly have Duran Duran looks. Making crappy videos didn't help matters, either. Rush revived Moving Pictures on their last tour by playing the disc straight through. \nSource: rollingstone.com [Readers' Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time]\nRate: 5 Stars out of 5 stars\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n1.
