The series, created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George PÃƒÂ©rez, re-introduced the Doom Patrol's Beast Boy as Changeling and introduced the machine man Cyborg, the alien Starfire, and the dark empath Raven.\n\nThe team's adversaries included DEATHSTROKE THE TERMINATOR, a mercenary who takes a contract to kill the Titans to fulfill a job his son had been unable to complete. This led to perhaps the most notable Titans storyline of the era (1984's &quot;THE JUDAS CONTRACT,&quot; in Tales of the Teen Titans #42-44 and Teen Titans Annual #3[30]) in which a psychopathic girl named Terra, with the destructive power to manipulate earth and all earth-related materials, infiltrates the Titans in order to destroy them. &quot;The Judas Contract&quot; won the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for &quot;Favorite Comic Book Story&quot; of 1984, and was later reprinted as a standalone trade paperback in 1988. This story also featured Dick Grayson (Robin) adopting the identity of NIGHTWING, Wally West giving up on his Kid Flash persona and quitting the Titans (which eventually led to him becoming the third FLASH), and the introduction of a new member in Jericho, the other son of Deathstroke.\n\nTHE TEEN TITANS: THE JUDAS CONTRACT was planned as the third DC Universe Animated Original Movie, to be released after Superman: Doomsday (2007) and Justice League: The New Frontier (2008). It was announced in 2006 but later put on hold. Warner Brothers Animation writer/producer Bruce Timm confirmed in April 2010 that there were no current plans to revive the project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884cb797372c5261c26e27ea719ded91f2db1716","amp;dn":"New+Teen+Titans+-+The+Judas+Contract+-+trade+paperback","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884cb797372c5261c26e27ea719ded91f2db1716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,76,183,151,55,44,82,97,194,110,39,234,113,157,237,145,242,219,23,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
