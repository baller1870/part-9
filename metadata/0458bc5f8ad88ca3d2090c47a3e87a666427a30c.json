It tackles themes such as depression/anxiety and identity issues in such a unique and special way, making this one hell of an album. It gets my utmost highest recommendation to anyone who hasn't heard it.\n\n\n1. Suffer for Fashion\n2. Sink the Seine\n3. Cato as a Pun\n4. Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse\n5. Gronlandic Edit\n6. A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger\n7. The Past is a Grotesque Animal\n8. Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider\n9. Faberge Falls for Shuggie\n10. Labyrinthian Pomp\n11. She's a Rejector\n12. We Were Born the Mutants Again With Leafling\n\n\n(This is my first torrent so forgive me if I make a mistake)\n\nI am accepting requests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0458bc5f8ad88ca3d2090c47a3e87a666427a30c","amp;dn":"of+Montreal+-+Hissing+Fuana%2C+Are+You+the+Destroyer%3F+%5B320+kbps+mp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0458bc5f8ad88ca3d2090c47a3e87a666427a30c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,88,188,95,138,216,140,163,210,9,12,71,163,232,122,102,100,39,163,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
