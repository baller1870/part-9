I made a mistake with the previous 501. It is actually JS-1. I have included an image of the sound check which is CDDA as well.  I am working on the MFCD collection and will be sending it along around the 15th. In the next few days the Sony Mastersound collection will be coming your way. Some of them are the same albums as the MFSL and you can decide for yourself which you like the most. They are all quite good and another interesting collection. The MFCD collection will not be complete but will be about 70% I think. A very obscure collection. I will post a link to the Mastersound here in the comments but you can also check my nick or do a search on Mastersound to find it. It is 40+ cdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s but again will not be complete. Hope you all are enjoying the UDCD collection!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80cc133fc75e367b4a53ee217a941c3a8f659de7","amp;dn":"MFSL+UDCD+SPECIAL+24KT+GOLD+PACK+%2310+ALAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80cc133fc75e367b4a53ee217a941c3a8f659de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,204,19,63,199,94,54,123,74,83,238,33,122,148,28,58,143,101,157,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
