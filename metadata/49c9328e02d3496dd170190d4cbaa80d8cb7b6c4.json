Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nBrief commentary on Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians.\n\n\nMaking use of his scholar's understanding, yet writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright shows us the liveliness of cosmopolitan Corinth and reveals the wisdom and challenge of Paul's writing, bringing out the pastoral sensitivity and deep insight that make this letter one of Paul's crowning achievements.\n\nTom Wright has undertaken a tremendous task: to provide guides to all the books of the New Testament, and to include in them his own translation of the entire text. Each short passage is followed by a highly readable discussion, with background information, useful explanations and suggestions, and thoughts as to how the text can be relevant to our lives today. A glossary is included at the back of the book. The series is suitable for group study, personal study, or daily devotions.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nN.T. (Tom) Wright is the Bishop of Durham in the Church of England. He is a prolific author and noted New Testament scholar, and was named by Christianity Today in 1999 as one of the world's top 5 new theologians. He has written over thirty books, both at the scholarly level (including Jesus and the Victory of God, The Resurrection of the Son of God, and The Meaning of Jesus) and for a popular audience (including The Meal Jesus Gave Us (WJK) and Who Was Jesus?).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c9328e02d3496dd170190d4cbaa80d8cb7b6c4","amp;dn":"N.T.+Wright+-+1+Corinthians+for+Everyone+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c9328e02d3496dd170190d4cbaa80d8cb7b6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,201,50,142,2,211,73,109,209,112,25,13,76,186,168,13,140,183,182,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
