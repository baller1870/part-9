But today, thanks to a new crop of devices and technologies, home automation is useful, fun, and maker-friendly. Using smartphones, wireless networks, the internet, simple microcontrollers, and even gesture recognition, DIY-style Smart Homes can now do everything promised and more, for much less Ã¢â‚¬â€ and MAKE shows you how in Volume 30.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/7756/db9dad6a.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f775d8be46726baad077561363508f838eb05d","amp;dn":"Make%3A+Technology+on+Your+Time%2C+Volume+30+%282012%29+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f775d8be46726baad077561363508f838eb05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,247,117,216,190,70,114,107,170,208,119,86,19,99,80,143,131,142,176,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
