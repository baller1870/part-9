The truth is creativity is in all of us and re-discovering it is the key to unlocking your fullest potential. Unthink is a book that pushes us beyond our traditional thought patterns.\n\nUnthink is a book that will inspire everyone to realize that we are capable of so much more than we have pre-conditioned for. Creativity is not in one special place--and it is not in one special person. Creativity is everywhere and in everyone who has the courage to unleash their creative genius.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f19647105ac1a006ce35fd92f07774cb321be4","amp;dn":"Unthink%3A+Rediscover+Your+Creative+Genius","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f19647105ac1a006ce35fd92f07774cb321be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,241,150,71,16,90,193,160,6,206,53,253,146,240,119,116,203,50,27,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
