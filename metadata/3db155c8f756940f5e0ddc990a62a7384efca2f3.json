The house and mother are, of course, metaphors for the motherland that would be explored in the two hours that follow. It seems to me that The House is the film that Bartas finally comes to terms with the trauma dealt by the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recent past that he has consistently expressed in his work. Consequently, the film also seems like a summation of the directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous films (One could say that the characters from BartasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ previous films reprise their roles here) and a melting pot of all the Tarkovsky influences that have characterized his work (especially the last four fictional works of the Russian). Shot almost entirely indoors, The House follows a young man carrying a pile of books as me moves from one room of the Marienbad-like mansion to the other, meeting various men and women, none of whom speak to each other and who might be real people of flesh and blood, shards of memory or figments of fantasy. The house itself might be an abstract space, as in The Corridor, representing the protagonistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind with its spatial configuration disoriented like the chessboard in the film. Furthermore, one also gets the feeling that Bartas is attempting to resolve the question of theory versus practice ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cold cynicism versus warm optimism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with regards to his politics as we witness the protagonist finally burn the books, page by page, he had so far held tightly to his chest.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : A Casa.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.49 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 58mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 795 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 1 529 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.194\n      Stream size : 1.27 GiB (85%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 256 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 217 MiB (14%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118823/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118823/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio (almost none); English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the French DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db155c8f756940f5e0ddc990a62a7384efca2f3","amp;dn":"Sharunas+Bartas+-+A+Casa+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db155c8f756940f5e0ddc990a62a7384efca2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,177,85,200,247,86,148,15,94,13,220,153,10,98,167,56,78,252,162,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
