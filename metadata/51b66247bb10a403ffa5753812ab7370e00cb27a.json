Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so it's more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails.\n\nRails 3 is a major release the changes aren't just incremental, but structural. So we decided to follow suit. This book isn't just a mild reworking of the previous edition to make it run with the new Rails. Instead, it's a complete refactoring.\n\n\n\nYou'll still find the Depot example at the front, but you'll also find testing knitted right in. Gone are the long reference chapters that's what the web does best. Instead you'll find more targeted information on all the aspects of Rails that you'll need to be a successful Web developer.\n\nBook Details\nPublisher:\tThe Pragmatic Programmers\nBy:\tSam Ruby\nISBN:\t978-1-93435-654-8\nYear:\t2011\nPages:\t480\nLanguage:\tEnglish\nFile size:\t6.61 MB\nFile format:\tPDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b66247bb10a403ffa5753812ab7370e00cb27a","amp;dn":"agile_web_development_with_rails_4th_edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b66247bb10a403ffa5753812ab7370e00cb27a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,182,98,71,187,16,164,3,255,165,117,56,18,171,115,112,224,12,178,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
