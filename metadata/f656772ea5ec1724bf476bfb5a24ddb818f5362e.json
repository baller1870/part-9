The English-language co-production stars Johnny Depp, Rebecca Hall, Kate Mara, Cillian Murphy, Paul Bettany, and Morgan Freeman. Pfister's usual collaborator, Christopher Nolan, served as executive producer on the project.\n\nAt one time, Paglen's screenplay was part of what is known as the Black List, a list of popular but unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. Transcendence was a disappointment at the box office, barely recovering its $100 million budget. The film received mainly negative reviews; it was criticized for its plot structure, characters and dialogue.\n\nCast:\n    Johnny Depp as Dr. Will Caster, an artificial-intelligence researcher.\n    Rebecca Hall as Evelyn Caster, Will's wife and a fellow academic.[5]\n    Paul Bettany as Max Waters, Will's best friend.[6]\n    Kate Mara as Bree, the leader of Revolutionary Independence From Technology (R.I.F.T.)[6]\n    Cillian Murphy as Donald Buchanan, an FBI agent.[7]\n    Morgan Freeman as Joseph Tagger, an FBI agent and old friend of Evelyn.[6]\n    Cole Hauser as Colonel Stevens, a military officer.[8]\n    Clifton Collins, Jr. as Martin[9]\n    Cory Hardrict as Joel Edmund, a member of the R.I.F.T.

Being part of a team working to create a sentient computer, he predicts that such a computer will create a technological singularity, or in his words &quot;Transcendence&quot;. His wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall), whom he loves deeply, supports his efforts and joins him in their garden around which he has erected copper mesh (effectively creating a Faraday cage) to block electromagnetic radiation. However, the extremist group &quot;Revolutionary Independence From Technology&quot; (R.I.F.T.) has one of their members shoot Will with an irradiated bullet and carry out a series of synchronized attacks on AI laboratories across the country. Will is given no more than a month to live.\n\nIn desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to upload Will's consciousness into the quantum computer that the project has developed. His best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), also a researcher, questions the wisdom of this choice. Will's likeness survives his body's death and requests that he will be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max panics, insisting that the computer intelligence is not Will. Evelyn forcibly asks Max to get out from the building and connects the computer intelligence to the Internet via satellite.\n\nMax is almost immediately confronted by Bree (Kate Mara), the leader of R.I.F.T. Max is captured by the terrorists and eventually persuaded to join them. The government is also deeply suspicious of what Will's uploaded person will do, and plans to use the terrorists to take the blame for the government's actions to stop Will.\n\nIn his virtual form, and with Evelyn's help, Will uses his new-found vast intelligence to build a technological utopia in a remote desert town called Brightwood, where he spearheads the development of groundbreaking new technologies in the fields of medicine, energy, biology and nanotechnology. But even Evelyn begins to grow fearful of Will's motives when he displays the ability to remotely connect to and control people's minds after they have been subjected to his nano-particles.\n\nFBI agent Donald Buchanan (Cillian Murphy), with the help of government scientist Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman), prepares to stop the technological singularity from spreading. As Will has spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, R.I.F.T develops a computer virus with the purpose of deleting Will's source code, killing him and, as a necessary side effect, destroying technological civilization. All the characters, Bree, Max, Tagger, Evelyn, and even Will Caster himself, are forced to choose between uploading the virus or risking assimilation into Will's Transcendence, which holds the promise of ending pollution, disease, and human mortality.\n\nWhen Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is taken aback seeing Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one. Will welcomes her but is instantly aware that she is carrying the virus and intends to destroy him. The FBI and the activists of R.I.F.T. attack the base with mortars, fatally wounding Evelyn. Will is given the choice between healing Evelyn's body, or protecting her by uploading her mind as she did his, which will also infect him with the virus. Will chooses to save the people he loves instead of saving technological civilization. As Will is dying, he explains to Evelyn that he did what he did for her: saving the planet was her wish, to learn the secrets of the universe was his. Then, the virus kills both Will and Evelyn, and a global technology collapse and blackout ensues.\n\nThree years later, in Will and Evelyn's garden outside their old home in Berkeley, Max notices that their sunflowers are the only blooming things in it. Upon closer examination, he notices that a drop of water falling from a sunflower petal instantly cleanses a puddle of oil Ã¢â‚¬â€ and realizes that the Faraday cage has also protected a sample of Will's nano-particles. The audience are left to infer that Will and Evelyn's consciousnesses are still alive within the active nano-particles, giving the world a second chance at Transcendence.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f656772ea5ec1724bf476bfb5a24ddb818f5362e","amp;dn":"Transcendence+%282014%29++-++English+HD+Bluray+Rip+X264+-+AC3+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f656772ea5ec1724bf476bfb5a24ddb818f5362e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,86,119,46,165,236,23,36,191,71,107,251,90,36,221,184,24,245,54,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
