A knitter of any skill level and inclination will surely become enchanted by the possibilities: garments ranging from simple garter and stockinette to more elaborate cables, bobbles, texture, and lace patterns.\nKnitting with eco-friendly undyed wool creates a rich, visually organic theme for the book. The chapters are organized by the natural tones of the yarns: white, gray, and beige. These fine woolens are not only visually stunning, but hold the promise of doing no harm to the environment.\nKnitters will be transported by the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artful photography, taken in one of SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exotic and famous locations, the Ice Hotel in JukkasjÃƒÂ¤rvi. Here, stylish knits are viewed in a dreamlike atmosphere, where ice columns and ice crystal crowns in the pillared hall range in color from the iciest light blue to the deepest petroleum blue. The only shivers a knitter will feel are those of pure delight at the contrast of woolen warmth next to icy environs.\nLike a modern fairy tale, Shades of Winter will captivate any knit\n\nAbout the Authors\nIngalill Johansson is the chief designer and quality manager for one of SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest knitting companies.
