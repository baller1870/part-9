Amongst the family memorabilia they find   \n    a photograph of their great grandmother, Charlotte       \n    Wyatt, whose maiden name was Hodge. Monty is intrigued    \n    as no-one in the family has spoken much of the Hodges.     \n                                                              \n    Monty's efforts lead him to a port near Anglesey where   \n    he learns of extraordinary colonial travels and a         \n    national disaster that ended in a family tragedy.          \n                                                              \n    On his father's side, Monty has heard that his           \n    ancestors were part of the famous Keiller marmalade       \n    dynasty, based in Dundee. Following their invention of     \n    chip marmalade, the Keillers became immensely rich but    \n    Monty's immediate family saw none of the fortune. So     \n    where did the missing marmalade millions go?              \n                                                               \n    Monty travels to Scotland to discover how his great       \n    grandfather was involved in the business. He unearths a  \n    bitter family feud that finally answers his questions     \n    about the Keiller fortune.                                 \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323b17624b572e95eb5c264ae9b3f224d3777aa2","amp;dn":"Who.Do.You.Think.You.Are.UK.Monty.Don.S07E04.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323b17624b572e95eb5c264ae9b3f224d3777aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,59,23,98,75,87,46,149,235,92,38,74,233,179,242,36,211,119,122,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
