They offer more verve and variety of both tone and musical approach than Kim Kashkashian and Robert Levin for ECM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ All in all, these are excellent, well-recorded performances of these fine works, brooding and turbulent in the best traditions of the early twentieth century.&quot;\n\n\nBBC Music Magazine\n\n&quot;Some of Hindemith's most haunting tunes went into his viola music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ This is the first volume of a projected and very welcome series devoted to the viola works of a composer who played the instrument himself and wrote prolifically for it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ [Sonata no 4] gives Power a chance to show off the gorgeously smooth tone of his 400-year-old instrument ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Power's acute sense of phrasing makes for an eloquent and elegiac 'Meditation'.&quot;\n\n\nThe Guardian\n\n&quot;All the performances are superb, with Laurence Power lavishing all the richness of his velvety tone and generous phrasing on some of the most striking melodic ideas that Hindemith ever produced.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\n\n1.
