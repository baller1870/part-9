Old rips that I've downloaded are poor quality. This is ripped from the restored DVD release.\n\n\nBabylon is set in South London at the start of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s, a time when reggae music was at its peak, along with a distinctively British brand of xenophobia and racism.\nThe plot concerns Blue, lead chanter for Ital Lion Sound (played by Aswad singer Brinsley Forde), in the run-up to a competition with a rival crew led by Jah Shaka (who appears as himself).\nOver the course of the film Blue socialises with his friends and clashes with his family, employer, and a local clan of racists, before going on a spiritual and physical journey through small hours London where he encounters a series of trials and temptations that set up the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s violent climax.\n\nBabylon remained an underground cult classic for years.\nAudiences got little chance to catch it.\nThe censors were scared that black Britons under the age of 18 would misread the film as an incitement to violence.\nThe BBFC saddled it with a limiting 'X' certificate.\nBBFC secretary James Ferman reassured, &quot;We all believe that it will become a classic of its type and be around for many years, so that black youngsters who cannot see it today will have their chance before very long.&quot;\nBut following its cinema run, Babylon went underground. With no VHS or DVD release (even the soundtrack wasn't reissued on CD until 2005),\nthe film instead collected a cult following via second-generation recordings, taped off the TV after either of its two screenings on Channel 4 during the 1980s and then exchanged and passed around.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/142/DORb1hPa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/142/DORb1hPa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/179/AXQb2F4O.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/179/AXQb2F4O.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/248/XMzb3gXT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/248/XMzb3gXT.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/278/7rOb4Ep6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/278/7rOb4Ep6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/315/5GZb5enN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/315/5GZb5enN.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/344/K6Db6OgP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/344/K6Db6OgP.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/397/neCb7sEZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/121/397/neCb7sEZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDVD Release Date: 13 Oct 2008\nEnglish subtitles included. \n\nComplete name                    : C:BabylonBabylon (1980) DVDRip XviD XandrA.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 701 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 071 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate                         : 934 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.875\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 83.8 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\n\n=======\n\nSoundtrack (thanks to the original uploader):\nMP3 Constant bitrate @ 256Kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
