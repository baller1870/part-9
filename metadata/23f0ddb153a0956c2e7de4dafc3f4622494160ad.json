With ZooKeeper, it's unnecessary to start from scratch, so the development of distributed applications becomes cleaner and easier.\r\n\r\nStarting with how to install, configure, and begin with ZooKeeper, we'll examine the intricacies of ZooKeeper's architecture and internals. Next, you'll learn ZooKeeper's programming model and write code to solve common distributed coordination tasks. We'll also walk you through administering ZooKeeper in a production environment, before finally covering practical examples of real-world projects and services using ZooKeeper to solve complex day-to-day problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f0ddb153a0956c2e7de4dafc3f4622494160ad","amp;dn":"Apache+ZooKeeper+Essentials+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f0ddb153a0956c2e7de4dafc3f4622494160ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,240,221,177,83,160,149,108,46,125,228,218,252,63,70,34,73,65,96,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
