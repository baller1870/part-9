All the original single mixes have been remastered for the box which also comes with a 32-page booklet featuring detailed annotations on each release as well as sleeve notes by Andy Francis, an authority on the band.\nAs one of the cornerstones of British Rock, Rainbow, led by the never-predictable but ever-astonishing guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, became synonymous with some of the most well regarded and popular charting Rock songs of the seventies and eighties. From the mystic and quasi-religious Ã¢â‚¬ËœMan On A Silver MountainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the solid gold anthems of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Night LongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœLong Live Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ RollÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœSince You Been GoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, each year in the decade of Rainbow was marked by some of the best songs and performances captured both on record and in-concert.\nThe box set gathers all of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic singles from the era in replicas of the original release, alongside a book featuring details on each of the titles.\nPassing through the band were some of the best the genre had to offer. Vocalists Ronnie James Dio and Graham Bonnet, bass player and producer Roger Glover and drummer Cozy Powell, each brought their individual talent to the table to record some of RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best loved hard rock on those timeless singles.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e9b8f80d3a28b701258fcd8104b493fe9ec732","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+The+Singles+Box+1975-1986+%282014%29+MP3%40320Kbps+Beolab170","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e9b8f80d3a28b701258fcd8104b493fe9ec732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,233,184,248,13,58,40,183,1,37,143,205,129,4,180,147,254,158,199,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
