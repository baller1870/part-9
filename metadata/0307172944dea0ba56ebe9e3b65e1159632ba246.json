A record full to the brim of wonderful ideas with an unapologetic singer flitting from heartbreak to sugared-out bitternes to all-out love with such deft lyrical brilliance. He sings surprising melodies flung about almost off-hand around killer hooks, never letting a song get predictable. If you have never listened to this album then you should. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 56\nArtist: Prefab Sprout\nAlbum: Steve McQueen\nYear: 1985\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0307172944dea0ba56ebe9e3b65e1159632ba246","amp;dn":"Prefab+Sprout+-+Steve+McQueen+%5BFLAC-1985%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0307172944dea0ba56ebe9e3b65e1159632ba246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,7,23,41,68,222,160,186,86,235,233,227,182,94,17,89,99,43,162,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
