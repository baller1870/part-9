Courland easily and seamlessly covers the science, technology, craft, and architectural expression in the invention and use of concrete with precision and lively prose, describing both the best and the worst examples of its use over the ages and in the present. He successfully manages to bring more than two thousand years of human history alive using concrete as the thread, while delving deep enough to reveal the intimate details of the business and family lives of its famous, and sometimes infamous, inventors, designers, and builders across the Western world.&quot;\nRandolph Langenbach, former senior analyst in response and recovery at FEMA, author of DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Tear It Down!\n\nthanks cntrl+c\n\nazw3 file, convert it in Calibre if you care to, But it works in kindle programs/apps if you place the file in the data folder.
