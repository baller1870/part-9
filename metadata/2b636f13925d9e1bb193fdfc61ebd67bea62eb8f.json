Midnight Sun is their first full length album and was well worth the four year wait after their EP La Carotte Bleue. \n\nMidnight Sun has a 70s psychedelic rock feel that could be compared to Pink Floyd in their Syd Barett era, but these guys are definitely something unique. \n\nTracklisting:\n1. Too Deep\t\n2. Xanadu\n3. Animals\n4. Johannesburg\n5. Midnight Sun\n6. Last Call\n7. Devil You Know\n8. Golden Earring\n9. Great Expectations\n10. Poor Paul Getty \n11. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Look Back Orpheus\n12.
