What if you learned that the man so affectionately referred to as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Great EmancipatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ supported white supremacy and pledged not to interfere with slavery in the South? Would you suddenly start to question everything you thought you knew about Lincoln and his presidency?\n\nYou should.\n\nThomas J. DiLorenzo, who ignited a fierce debate about LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy with his book The Real Lincoln, now presents a litany of stunning new revelations that explode the most enduring (and pernicious) myths about our sixteenth president. Marshaling an astonishing amount of new evidence, Lincoln Unmasked offers an alarming portrait of a political manipulator and opportunist who bears little resemblance to the heroic, stoic, and principled figure of mainstream history.\n\nDid you know that Lincoln . . .\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ did NOT save the union? In fact, Lincoln did more than any other individual to destroy the voluntary union the Founding Fathers recognized.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ did NOT want to free the slaves? Lincoln, who did not believe in equality of the races, wanted the Constitution to make slavery Ã¢â‚¬Å“irrevocable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ was NOT a champion of the Constitution? Contrary to his high-minded rhetoric, Lincoln repeatedly trampled on the ConstitutionÃ¢â‚¬â€and even issued an arrest warrant for the chief justice of the United States!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ was NOT a great statesman? Lincoln was actually a warmonger who manipulated his own people into a civil war.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ did NOT utter many of his most admired quotations? DiLorenzo exposes a legion of statements that have been falsely attributed to Lincoln for generationsÃ¢â‚¬â€usually to enhance his image.\n\nIn addition to detailing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offenses against the principles of freedom, equality, and statesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rights, Lincoln Unmasked exposes the vast network of academics, historians, politicians, and other Ã¢â‚¬Å“gatekeepersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who have sanitized his true beliefs and willfully distorted his legacy. DiLorenzo reveals how the deification of Lincoln reflects a not-so-hidden agenda to expand the size and scope of the American state far beyond what the Founding Fathers envisionedÃ¢â‚¬â€an expansion that Lincoln himself began.\n\nThe hagiographers have shaped LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image to the point that it has become more fiction than fact. With Lincoln Unmasked, DiLorenzo shows us an Abraham Lincoln without the rhetoric, lies, and political bias that have clouded a disastrous presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enduring damage to the nation.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n Thomas J.
