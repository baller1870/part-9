I'M JUST CHANGING THE NAME SO ALL SHOW TITLES ARE FORMATTED ALIKE.\n\n\n&quot;Billboard ranks 'em, American Top 40 counts 'em down.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. Some are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne song in this countdown is by an act that holds the all-time record for hitting the top 40 with the most lead singers.\n\nCasey tells the story of the song that holds the all-time record for most weeks at number one. It was written by a convict serving time for attempted murder.\n\nAir Supply is back in the countdown (now as a duo) for the first time since 1983 with their song &quot;Just As I Am&quot; (at number 2).\n\nThere is a band in the countdown that holds the all-time record for hitting the top 40 with the most lead singers. Casey explains.\n\n40:    Wake Up (Next To You) - Graham Parker and The Shot\n39:    What About Love - Heart\n38:    You Spin Me Around (Like A Record) - Dead or Alive        \n37:    Little By Little - Robert Plant     \n36:    Never Ending Story - Limahl     \n35:    Shout - Tears For Fears    \n34:    Never Surrender - Corey Hart\n33:    Who's Holding Donna Now - Debarge\nLdd: Solid - Ashford &amp; Simpson\n32:    People Are People - Depeche Mode\n31:    Possession Obsession - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n30:    Bang A Gong (Get It On) - The Power Station\n29:    Cannonball - Supertramp    \n28:    Just As I Am - Air Supply\n27:    19 - Paul Hardcastle\n26:    Getcha Back - The Beach Boys\n25:    Fresh - Kool &amp; The Gang\n24:    Axel F - Harold Faltermeyer\n23:    Tough All Over - John Cafferty &amp; The Beaver Brown Band\n22:    Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes) - Kim Carnes\n21:    Everything She Wants - Wham\n20:    Sentimental Street - Night Ranger\n19:    If You Love Somebody Set Them Free - Sting\n18:    Suddenly - Billy Ocean\n17:    Glory Days - Bruce Springsteen\n16:    Smuggler's Blues - Glenn Frey\n15:    The Goonies 'R' Good Tonight - Cyndi Lauper\n14:    Everytime You Go Away - Paul Young\n13:    You Give Good Love - Whitney Houston\n12:    Voices Carry - 'Til Tuesday\n11:    Walking On Sunshine - Katrina And The Waves\n10:    In My House - Mary Jane Girls\n9:    Things Can Only Get Better - Howard Jones\n8:    Would I Lie To You - The Eurythmics\nLdd: Let's Hear It For The Boy - Deniece Williams\n7:    Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears For Fears\n6:    The Search Is Over - Survivor\n5:    Angel - Madonna\n4:    Raspberry Berret - Prince And The Revolution\n3:    A View To A Kill - Duran Duran\n2:    Sussudio - Phil Collins\n1:    Heaven - Bryan Adams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9728afd77862b57ab169dc93b00d91a1204405","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_June_29th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9728afd77862b57ab169dc93b00d91a1204405","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,151,40,175,215,120,98,181,122,177,105,220,147,176,13,145,161,32,68,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
