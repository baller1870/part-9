Plug your tomtom device with the USB to your PC or card reader\n\n2. Copy &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot; to your TomTom device root directory for all product activation \n(The keygen also works inside a map or voice directory also if needed)\n\n3. Run &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot;\n\n4. Done...\n\n\nMethod 2:\n1. Plug your tomtom device with the USB to your PC or card reader\n\n2. Run &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot; from desktop or any other place\n\n3. Select tomtom drive letter when asked \n\n4. Done...\n\n\nMethod 3:\n1. copy &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot; and &quot;TT*.BIF&quot; your maps storage\n\n2. Run &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot; and all maps and other stuff activated containing all sub directorys \n\n3. Done...\n\nNote 0: If you get trouble running the .exe then &quot;right click and run as administrator&quot;\nIf you use Wince and mapshare patch copy ttnavigator.bif to ttgo.ori\n\nNote 1: if you have a new meta code what is not in the integrated meta.txt dated (See in program for date of current meta.txt integrated) \nand there is a problem with online update meta.txt You must put all new meta codes in a file named mymeta.txt and copy it to the ROOT \nDirectory or MAP directory too, always the same directory as FastActivate.exe\n\nNote 2: This program gets the latest meta.txt after press button &quot;Update meta.txt&quot;, so an internet connection is needed for new maps...\nBy default this program uses the meta.txt file integrated (see file name for date)\n\nNote 3: If you want to patch TTHome choose &quot;TomTom Home&quot; this works automatic and no need to search for any files just wait and it will tell you when done,\nAlso this program can patch ttsystem/PNDNavigator files copy FastActivate.exe to your device root and choose button &quot;ttsystem/PNDnavigator&quot; and it \nwill tell you when done.\n\nNote 4: If you are doing a fresh install on internal memory of navcore and map then you will need to restart the unit once after the installation of navcore \nBefore you try and patch the map because your unit will then generate the needed ttgo.bif file for the keygen to read. Also if you are installing to\na sd card rather than the internal memory the same applies you will need to insert the sd card into the tomtom device and reboot before you patch the\nmap so it generates the needed ttgo.bif file.\n\nNote 5: Program works with TomTom PC emulator.\n\nNote 6: If you want activate maps directly harddisk copy &quot;TT*.BIF&quot; same directory with &quot;FastActivate.exe&quot;, then activator works inside map directory and activate all sub directory too.\n\nCredits: NAVITOTAL\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c762385a67bc447b943849695f48ebf78cd9cd1","amp;dn":"FastActivate+Premium+Edition+v1.8.8.0+%5BUnlock+TomToS+Very+Easy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c762385a67bc447b943849695f48ebf78cd9cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,118,35,133,166,123,196,71,185,67,132,150,149,244,142,191,120,205,156,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
