Intel graphics cards do not currently work for this game/tech. We will be lowering the hardware requirements with time, but no set date. Also some known issues with integrated intel graphics cards, so please be aware of that.\n\nThis is a fantasy based survival sandbox role playing game. The engine and game are a work in progress, so it does not perform as well as some games made on unity or other commercial engines, but it gets better with each iteration. To get a better feel for where the game is at, check for YouTube videos that were posted within the last month of your reading this. Its pretty tough to gauge what is appropriate to whom at what level of development, so we encourage doing some digging before dropping any money or supporting the project in any way.\n\nWhile we are building a massive world to explore, a lot of this project is about building solid Ã¢â‚¬Å“cutting edgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tech, to allow people to create and collaborate on their own projects, as well. Modding is not just a part of TUG, its a fundamental consideration in everything we build.\nGame Modes\n\n    Survival Mode: Find stuff, craft stuff, build stuff, beat stuff up, eat stuff, break stuff, break other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stuff (or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t die. Ya know, survival stuff.\n    Creative Mode: Build stuffÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ creatively. \n\nGame Features\n\n    Non blocky voxels: Explore and build in a not blocky voxel world\n    Crafting: Anything you find in game, can be crafted or created in some way\n    Modding: Pretty much anything we can do, you can do as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bee155cb7499e1d616f4c912c990e3c58ffefff2","amp;dn":"TUG+v0.8.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bee155cb7499e1d616f4c912c990e3c58ffefff2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,225,85,203,116,153,225,214,22,244,201,18,201,144,227,197,143,254,255,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
