This bug affected only WinRAR.exe, not RAR.exe.\n- if -x*somefolder* exclusion mask was specified when archiving and if name of current folder contained 'somefolder', WinRAR excluded all files and stopped creating an archive.\n- GUI self-extracting archives did not work in Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWinRAR is an archiving utility that completely supports RAR and ZIP archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives. It consistently makes smaller archives than the competition, saving disk space and transmission costs.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command line interface. WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers with the inclusion of a special &quot;Wizard&quot; mode which allows instant access to the basic archiving functions through a simple question and answer procedure.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength archive encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key of 128 bits. It supports files and archives up to 8,589 billion gigabytes in size. It also offers the ability to create selfextracting and multivolume archives. With recovery record and recovery volumes, you can reconstruct even physically damaged archives.\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n ------------\n-Install WinRAR 32 or 64-bit, wich software you have\n-After installarion use the key to register this product !!!\n-Have Fun\n\n\n\nSee my other torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/user/3R01/\n                           ---------------------------------\n\n\n\nComment and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c532c4c6a2b9b691b3ee3d149dd32400933141","amp;dn":"WinRAR+4.11+%2864+and+32-bit%29+%2BRegistration+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c532c4c6a2b9b691b3ee3d149dd32400933141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,197,50,196,198,162,185,182,145,179,238,61,20,157,211,36,0,147,49,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
