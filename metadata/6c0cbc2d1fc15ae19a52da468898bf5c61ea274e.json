I Believe (In Love) from 1971 is an oh so \ngentle, wistful song with melodious organ lines and a male voices \nthat caresses the soul, Emma from about 1974 is a passionate dirge \nthat tells the tragic story of Emmaline and So You Win Again was \ntheir huge top 5 hit from 1978. My other favourites here include You \nSexy Thing, Love Is Life, I'll Put You Together Again and their \nother massive hit, Every 1's A Winner. The lead singer's smooth warm \nvoice wraps itself perfectly around the synth-based instrumentation \nand all of the songs are tuneful and memorable. Hot Chocolate were \nperhaps the UK's premier soul band in the seventies, consistently \nscoring hits, even during the disco era when they mastered the form \nin their song Disco Queen. If they weren't a British band, I would \nhave expected them to be on the Stax label! Yes, this music is that \ngood and Hot Chocolate's sound compares well with the best of \nMotown and Stax/Volt's romantic songs. This is a wonderful collection \nand Errol Brown's voice is smooth and sexy\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] You Sexy Thing\n[02] It Started With A Kiss\n[03] Brother Louie\n[04] Girl Crazy\n[05] So You Win Again\n[06] Put Your Love In Me\n[07] Love Is Life\n[08] I'll Put You Together Again\n[09] No Doubt About It\n[10] Everyone's A Winner\n[11] Emma  Listen Listen  \n[12] I Gave You My Heart (Didn't I?)\n[13] You Could've Been A Lady\n[14] Disco Queen\n[15] Don't Stop It Now\n[16] A Child's Prayer\n[17] What Kinda Boy (You're Lookin' For Girl)\n[18] I Believe (In Love)\n[19] Are You Getting Enough Happiness?  \n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 01h:15m:29s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 179mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes MP3 Format\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B\n\nRelease Date\t\t- March 1993\n\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.hot-chocolate.co.uk \n\t\t\t- http://www.errolbrown.com \n\t\t\t\n\n* * * PLEASE SEED TO A RATIO OF 1:1 OR GREATER * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LL ONLY RE-SEED IF THERE IS MORE THAN 10 PEERS WAITING * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c0cbc2d1fc15ae19a52da468898bf5c61ea274e","amp;dn":"%5B1993%5D+Their+Greatest+Hits+-+Hot+Chocolate+-+179mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c0cbc2d1fc15ae19a52da468898bf5c61ea274e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,12,188,45,31,193,90,225,154,82,218,70,136,152,191,92,97,234,39,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
