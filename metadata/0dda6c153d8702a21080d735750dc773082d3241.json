The papers were carefully selected during two rounds of reviewing and improvement for inclusion in the volume and address all aspects of coding theory, cryptology and related areas - such as combinatorics - theoretical or applied. Topics addressed are coding theory, secure codes, hash functions, combinatorics, boolean functions, authentication, cryptography, protocols, sequences, and secure communications.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 283 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (June 26, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642018130\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642018138","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dda6c153d8702a21080d735750dc773082d3241","amp;dn":"Coding+and+Cryptology%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dda6c153d8702a21080d735750dc773082d3241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,218,108,21,61,135,2,162,16,128,215,53,117,13,199,115,8,45,50,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
