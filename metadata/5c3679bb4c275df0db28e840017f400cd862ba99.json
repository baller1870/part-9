Singers Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell were the founders, and certainly the heart, of the group, and together their melodramatic musical vision gave adult-contemporary pop a higher profile.\n\nPLATINUM &amp; GOLD COLLECTION contains 13 of Air Supply's best tracks, including the pleading &quot;All Out of Love,&quot; the soaring &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; and, of course, the sing-along classic &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All.&quot; This PLATINUM &amp; GOLD COLLECTION also presents the epic ballad &quot;I Can Wait Forever&quot; (from the film GHOSTBUSTERS) and some of Air Supply's lesser-known treasures, most notably &quot;Now and Forever,&quot; a song that epitomizes the rich melodicism of this vocal duo.\n(Source: cduniverse.com)\n\nOriginal Year: 2004\nGenre: Rock/Pop, Rock, Pop\n\n01.
