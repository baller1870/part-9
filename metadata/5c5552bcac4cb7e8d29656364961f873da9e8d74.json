Further early recordings have resurfaced on the internet.\n\nParallels have been drawn between Crime and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\n\nCrime were famed for their live performances,\n\nwhere Bonney's delicate physical appearance contrasted sharply with his deep, dark voice. He has since gone on to record solo material.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://home.claranet.nl/users/maes/crime/discog.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://home.claranet.nl/users/maes/crime/discog.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c5552bcac4cb7e8d29656364961f873da9e8d74","amp;dn":"Crime+and+the+city+Solution+in+the+club+LVC+city+leiden+-+hollan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c5552bcac4cb7e8d29656364961f873da9e8d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,85,82,188,172,76,183,232,210,150,86,54,73,97,248,115,218,158,141,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
