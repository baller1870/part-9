AFI consists of 174 solved algorithm design problems. It covers core material, such as searching and sorting; general design principles, such as graph modeling and dynamic programming; advanced topics, such as strings, parallelism and intractability. It also covers system design, problem solving, and interviewing techniques. AFI's authors are practicing algorithmists, with extensive academic and industrial experience. They have collectively published over 100 articles on applied algorithms, applied their skills at Google, Microsoft, IBM, Qualcomm, and a number of smaller software startups, and conducted many job interviews for various computer science jobs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a277f50df30b73330491df4e8771f4a89c548d8","amp;dn":"Algorithms+For+Interviews","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a277f50df30b73330491df4e8771f4a89c548d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,39,127,80,223,48,183,51,48,73,29,244,232,119,31,74,137,197,72,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
