Both of these discs had their \nproblems, noise reduction for one, seriously damaging the high \nfrequencies, and also some pretty bad low frequency hum. But this new \nsource blows the others out of the water. The problem with this new \nElektra Acetate, however, is that it is noisy, very noisy, suffering \nall of the problems you would expect from a 50-year-old acetate. \n\nFor this release, unlike others floating around, I have not used any \nnoise reduction, but instead painstakingly de-clicked, de-popped, and \nde-crackled each track one-by-one, putting the integrity of the music \nabove anything else - leaving what should be a very enjoyable listen, \nof what is a very important historical recording. I have also added \nall of the stereo elements that were missing from this acetate from \nthe Yellow Dog disc (only a section of dialogue), some tracks are \navailable in longer form in mono with extra studio chat, but I did not \nwant to mix stereo and mono here, this is simply stereo only. I also \ntook the liberty of pitch, phase and level correcting this disc, as \nwell as un-doing the peak limiting applied to the original disc. \n\n(De-clicked and de-noised version)\nTrack 01.
