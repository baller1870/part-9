But don1t go searching for any pre-millennium tension here. At its core, Maverick A Strike is a record you1d play at a party, &quot;It1s Great When We1re Together&quot; and &quot;Ultra Stimulation&quot; being the songs you1d cue up when you feared everyone was going to call it a night. Recorded in the lo-fi tradition of '70s Jamaican pop, Maverick1s music hardly fits snugly alongside that of other junglists. And by getting more than he probably should out of a hoarse voice and limited range, Quaye even makes a case for the modern relevance of roots-reggae. Not bad for a rude-boy who perfected his chops in the British dance scene.\n\nThis is the debut album from Trickys nephew Finlay Quaye and includes the excellent singles Sunday Shining, Even After All and Your Love Gets Sweeter. The album is a mix of reggae styles and indie, mixed with a little brit pop, spiced with bass lines here and there.\n\nIt actually doesn't work at all for 30-50% of the album and so you will find yourself skipping tracks. But for the areas where it does work it works extremely well, and you can't help but like it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e9722df3a8996b98f598d2dfc74fe8bd6758ae","amp;dn":"Finlay+Quaye+-+Maverick+A+Strike+-+mp3+-+128kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e9722df3a8996b98f598d2dfc74fe8bd6758ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,233,114,45,243,168,153,107,152,245,152,210,223,199,79,232,189,103,88,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
