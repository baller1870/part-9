DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inferno.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Langdon battles a chilling adversary and grapples with an ingenious riddle that pulls him into a landscape of classic art, secret passageways, and futuristic science. Drawing from DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark epic poem, Langdon races to find answers and decide whom to trust . . . before the world is irrevocably altered. \n\nAbout The Author\nDan Brown is the author of numerous bestselling novels, including the #1 New York Times bestseller, The Da Vinci Code. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent time as an English teacher before turning his efforts fully to writing.\nIn 1996, Dan's interest in code-breaking and covert government agencies led him to write his first novel, Digital Fortress, which quickly became a #1 national bestselling eBook. Set within the clandestine National Security Agency, the novel explores the fine line between civilian privacy and national security. Brown's follow-up techno-thriller, Deception Point, centered on similar issues of morality in politics, national security, and classified technology.\nThe son of a Presidential Award winning math professor and of a professional sacred musician, Dan grew up surrounded by the paradoxical philosophies of science and religion. These complementary perspectives served as inspiration for his acclaimed novel Angels &amp; Demons-a science vs. religion thriller set within a Swiss physics lab and Vatican City. Recently, he has begun work on a series of symbology thrillers featuring his popular protagonist Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of iconography and religious art. The upcoming series will include books set in Paris, London, and Washington D.C. \n\nAbout The Reader\nPaul Michael was born in Canada and is an actor of international status on stage, screen, and television. His TV credits include leading roles in a number of British sitcoms. He has acted onstage in plays ranging from Macbeth to The Wizard of Oz. \nWho knew what the response to THE DA VINCI CODE would be, or how long it would captivate readers and listeners? Now, after weeks on the bestseller lists, thousands of listeners have heard PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. More good titles have come PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way, and we celebrate two Earphones-winning audios in this issueÃ¢â‚¬â€THE EXILE by Allan Folsom and TO THE LAST MAN by Jeff Shaara. Paul kept a ready supply of Russian and German character voices for both THE EXILE and The ROMANOV PROPHECY, recorded at about the same time. Paul says he loves the challenge of portraying Ã¢â‚¬Å“a room full of Germans.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During his research on Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Red BaronÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Baron von Richthofen for TO THE LAST MAN, Paul discovered that numerous other characters in the story were not fictional. With this knowledge, he was able to make his performance even more vivid.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f2b9b012187c6de400a67e4c4791fb9d3091b1","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+Inferno+-+M4B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9f2b9b012187c6de400a67e4c4791fb9d3091b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,242,185,176,18,24,124,109,228,0,166,126,76,71,145,251,157,48,145,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
