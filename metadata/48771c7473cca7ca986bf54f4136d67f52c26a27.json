The first half-hour or so concerns the investigation by FBI \nAgent Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and his partner Sam Stanley (Kiefer \nSutherland) into the murder of night-shift waitress Teresa Banks in the \nsmall Washington state town of Deer Meadow. When Desmond finds a \nmysterious clue to the murder, he inexplicably disappears. The film then \ncuts to one year later in the nearby town of Twin Peaks and follows the \nevents during the last week in the life of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) a \ntroubled teenage girl with two boyfriends; the hot-tempered rebel Bobby \nBriggs (Dana Ashbrook) and quiet biker James Hurley (James Marshall), \nher drug addiction, and her relationship with her difficult (and possible \nschizophrenic) father Leland (Ray Wise), a story in which her violent \nmurder was later to motivate much of the TV series. Contains a \nconsiderable amount of sex, drugs, violence, very loud music and \ninexplicable imagery.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Kyle MacLachlan.\n=&gt;-David Bowie.\n=&gt;-Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-David Lynch.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre.........................: Drama : Mystery : Suspense.\n=&gt;-Release Date..................: 1992.\n=&gt;-Language......................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size.....................: 1.58 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate..............: 1 684 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime.................: 2h 14mn.\n=&gt;-Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me..: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me/\n=&gt;-Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me..: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio..................: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution....................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate......................: 1567 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate......................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate..............: 208 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48771c7473cca7ca986bf54f4136d67f52c26a27","amp;dn":"Twin+Peaks+Fire+Walk+with+Me+-+David+Lynch+Remastered+1992+Eng+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48771c7473cca7ca986bf54f4136d67f52c26a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,119,28,116,115,204,167,202,152,107,245,79,65,54,214,127,82,194,106,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
