Not only did families risk their fathers and sons in active combat, but every member of society was mobilized in some way to contribute to the war effort. In the course of these eventful years the population experienced rationing, shortages, aerial bombing, thousands more women in work (known as Ã¢â‚¬ËœdilutionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the workplace!), industrial unrest, a large influx of foreign refugees, and a host of other shocks. Even the king was not exempt: he, too, had a ration card, and the flowerbeds of Buckingham Palace were planted with vegetables. \nIan Beckett examines the full story - one that is, by turns, grim, humorous, touching, surprising, and even inspiring. Among other details, learn how the feeding of pigeons was declared illegal, why a town council forbade punctuation, and what Ã¢â‚¬ËœBelgian flushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was. The authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative is reinforced by a welter of photographs, original documents and letters, and poignant personal stories of life on BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home front.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41fa219f2c43c513b165eaa87ee9d129eef99973","amp;dn":"Home+Front+1914-1918+-+How+Britain+Survived+the+Great+War+%28Histo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41fa219f2c43c513b165eaa87ee9d129eef99973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,250,33,159,44,67,197,19,177,101,234,168,126,233,209,41,238,249,153,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
