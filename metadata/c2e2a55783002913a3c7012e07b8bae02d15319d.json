Initially inspired by the New Romantic fashion, their music has featured a mixture of funk, jazz, soul and synthpop. They were one of the most successful bands of the 1980s, achieving ten Top Ten singles and four Top Ten albums in the UK between 1980 and 1990. The band split acrimoniously in 1990 but announced their reunion in March 2009, complete with a tour that began in October 2009. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce More 2009\n\n\nOnce More is the seventh studio album by British band Spandau Ballet. It was released by Mercury Records on October 19, 2009 in UK and Ireland. The album includes eleven re-recordings from their back catalogue and two newly written songs. The first single, the title track &quot;Once More&quot;, one of the two brand new songs, was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2009 and as a digital download on the same day as the album was released. The music video for &quot;Once More&quot; was filmed. The album debuted at number 7 on the UK Album Chart on October 25, 2009.\n\n\nOnce More is the first new recording by Spandau Ballet since 1989. Eleven of the thirteen tracks are re-recordings of previously recorded songs by the group. The first and the last track on the album, &quot;Once More&quot; and &quot;Love is All&quot; are new songs written during the band's reunion. The title track is written by Gary Kemp and Steve Norman, while &quot;Love is All&quot; is the first Spandau Ballet song written by Tony Hadley.[3] The album is produced by Danton Supple, who co-produced Coldplay's X&amp;Y album.[3]\n\nSinger Tony Hadley said about the new recordings: &quot;When we got back together and the tour dates went on sale, none of us could believe the fantastic reaction we got from fans and the press alike. When the opportunity came to get into a studio and play music together, we couldn't pass it up.&quot;[4] Gary Kemp said about the title track that &quot;the new song was a way for us to show that Spandau Ballet are back, not just to play the hits on tour but also to take on our contemporaries in the pop charts!&quot;[4]\n\nThe re-recordings of the eleven older songs are made in a semi-acoustic, unplugged-like style, which gives their songs a 21st-century flavour, according to sax player Steve Norman, taking them to some &quot;very dark, different place&quot;.[5] According to Gary Kemp the sound of the album is not only the sound of Spandau Ballet reinvented for the 21st century, but also &quot;how we would have made these songs the first time around if we had the maturity and know-how to achieve it&quot;.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Once More&quot; (Gary Kemp, Steve Norman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n2.\t&quot;To Cut A Long Story Short&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n3.\t&quot;Gold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n4.\t&quot;True&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n5.\t&quot;Chant No 1&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n6.\t&quot;I'll Fly For You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n7.\t&quot;Only When You Leave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n8.\t&quot;Through The Barricades&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n9.\t&quot;She Loved Like Diamond&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n10.\t&quot;Communication&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n11.\t&quot;Lifeline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n12.\t&quot;With The Pride&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n13.\t&quot;Love Is All&quot; (Tony Hadley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2e2a55783002913a3c7012e07b8bae02d15319d","amp;dn":"Spandau+Ballet+-+Once+More+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2e2a55783002913a3c7012e07b8bae02d15319d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,226,165,87,131,0,41,19,163,199,1,46,7,184,186,224,45,21,49,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
