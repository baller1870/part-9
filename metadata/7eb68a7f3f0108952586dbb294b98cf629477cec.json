Every chapter takes you all the way from idea to finished project. Even if you have no experience with Arduino, this book will get you set up with all the materials, software, and hardware you need; you'll complete simple projects first, and then build on your growing expertise to make more complex projects. By the end of the book, you'll have learned:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Electronics basics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to prototype successfully\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Arduino programming\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to design and build your own wearable Arduino creations\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Along the way you'll create fun and inspiring wearables, such as:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An LED bracelet: learn the basics of wearable electronics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A synthesizer tie: accept user input and create output in response\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A solar-powered glow in the dark bag: create self-sufficient wearables\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A shape memory flower: store state and manipulate your wearables\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An EL wire dress: add designer touches to your wearables\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A beatbox hoodie: use a voice-activated sequencer and skin resistance to create the coolest of urban wearables\n\nArduino Wearables is the complete guide to getting started with Arduino and wearable computing. The 10 inspiring projects to make, learn from, and build upon will equip you for creating your own projects; the only limit is your imagination.\n\nWhat you'll learn\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The essence of wearable computing\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The basics of electronics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The relationship between basic electronics and smart materials\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Programming for the Arduino / LilyPad\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Circuit building and construction in a wearable context\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Advanced methods for wearable prototyping\n\nWho this book is for\nElectronics hobbyists, Arduino enthusiasts, and fabric artists who want to add something extra to their designs. Even if you've never worked with Arduino before, this book is still for you.\n\nTitle: Arduino Wearables\nAuthor: Tony Olsson\nPublisher: Apress\nYear: 2012\nISBN: 1430243597\nFormat: PDF\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
