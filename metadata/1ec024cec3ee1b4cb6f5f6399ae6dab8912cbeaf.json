Kauppinen, J. Partanen (Wiley-VCH, 2001).pdf\r\n\r\nThis modern approach to the subject is clearly and logically structured, and gives readers an understanding of the essence of Fourier transforms and their applications. All important aspects are included with respect to their use with optical spectroscopic data.\r\nBased on popular lectures, the authors provide the mathematical fundamentals and numerical applications which are essential in practical use. The main part of the book is dedicated to applications of FT in signal processing and spectroscopy, with IR and NIR, NMR and mass spectrometry dealt with both from a theoretical and practical point of view. Some aspects, linear prediction for example, are explained here thoroughly for the first time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec024cec3ee1b4cb6f5f6399ae6dab8912cbeaf","amp;dn":"Fourier+Transforms+in+Spectroscopy+-+J.+Kauppinen%2C+J.+Partanen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec024cec3ee1b4cb6f5f6399ae6dab8912cbeaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,192,36,206,195,238,27,76,182,245,246,57,154,230,218,184,145,44,190,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
