While these strategies may  help produce some limited benefits in this life, they fail to consider  the life to come. As Allah, The Most High said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKnow that the life of  this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to  one another and competition in increase of wealth and children ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ like  the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the  tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow, then it becomes  [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and  forgiveness from Allah and approval. And what is the life of this world,  but a deceptive enjoyment?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In this audio presentation, Dr. Abu Ammenah  Bilal Phillips discusses the true meaning of success and seven of the  habits possessed by truly successful people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ those who, through  revelation, were promised Paradise.\n7 Habits of Truly Successful  People is not only an inspiring and soul energizing program, but a  strong reminder and a road map to Islamic excellence.\n\nAbout the Author:\nAbu  Ameenah Bilal Philips was born in Jamaica, but grew up in Canada, where  he accepted Islam in 1972.
