After having seen the film again many decades after its first viewings my feeling is different. I believe that Lucian PintilieÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs first film is as daring in content and especially in its subliminal message as it is in its form which clearly shows already the hand of a skilled director, having learned and assimilated all the lessons of the French New Wave and placing them in the service of his cinematographic message.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip):\n\nGeneral           : Duminica la ora 6.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 405 Kbps\nLength            : 1.30 GiB for 1h 17mn 35s 880ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 2 205 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nText #0           : VobSub\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059137&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Romanian\nSubtitles: English\n\nMy rip\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee15fb617fa6e2fe76d13198924eb6440d794e3b","amp;dn":"Duminica+la+ora+6+AKA+Sunday+at+6+%28Lucian+Pintilie%2C+1965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee15fb617fa6e2fe76d13198924eb6440d794e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,21,251,97,127,166,226,254,118,209,49,152,146,78,182,68,13,121,78,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
