Buoyed by the online buzz surrounding the band's single &quot;Pumped Up Kicks,&quot; Foster the People have crafted a batch of similarly catchy, electro-lite dance-pop that fits nicely next to such contemporaries as MGMT and Phoenix. To these ends you get the aforementioned anthem &quot;Pumped Up Kicks,&quot; as well as the hypnotic disco hop track &quot;Call It What You Want.&quot; Equally compelling are such deep cuts as the yearning, melancholy ballad &quot;I Would Do Anything for You&quot; and the foot stomping arcade game-sounding anthem &quot;Houdini.&quot; Burning with a hot track intensity somewhere in between early evening rave-up and late-night club afterglow, Torches is a beacon of melodic dance-pop love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85cde290acc993489605d5934c692fb1a9890311","amp;dn":"Foster+the+People+-+Torches+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85cde290acc993489605d5934c692fb1a9890311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,205,226,144,172,201,147,72,150,5,213,147,76,105,47,177,169,137,3,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
