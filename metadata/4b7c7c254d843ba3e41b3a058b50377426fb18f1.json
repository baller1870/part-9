More and more PCs are shipped without floppy drives these days, and it is such a royal pain when you need to run diagnostic tools on them.\nÃ‚Â· Free yourself from the slow loading speed of the floppy drive. Even if you do have a floppy drive, it is still much much faster to run your diagnostic tools from the CDROM drive, rather than wait for the tool to load from the floppy drive.\nÃ‚Â· Consolidate as many diagnostic tools as possible into one bootable CD. Wouldn't you like to avoid digging into the dusty box to look for the right floppy disk, but simply run them all from a single CD? Then the Ultimate Boot CD is for you!\nÃ‚Â· Run Ultimate Boot CD from your USB memory stick. A script on the CD prepares your USB memory stick so that it can be used on newer machines that supports booting from USB devices. You can access the same tools as you would from the CD version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bootable CD including a collection of software utilities\nWritten by Elena Opris on June 8th, 2012\n\nThe times when floppy disks were in the trend are long gone. Even though theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re history now, they were quite popular at one point, since they were the only portable devices around. Their tiny capacity was used to store everything from documents to media content, but they were also the only solution to perform a system recovery.\n\nFloppy disks are now on their way to extinction; but even so, there are situations that require floppy-based diagnostic utilities. When and if this happens, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best that you have those tools stored on a CD disc or even better, on a removable USB drive.\n\nThe best solution is to create a bootable CD that sports all the features of bootable floppy disks. This way, you have all the utilities you need on a single disc.\n\nUltimate Boot CD is a back-up and recovery tool that includes all the diagnostic utilities youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever require. In other words, you need this software to create a bootable CD in case disaster strikes and your computer breaks down.\n\nUltimate Boot CD features an interface thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite similar to the one of BIOS, so users accustomed to this approach wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t face significant problems. After you create your bootable CD and insert it in the computer, a text-based menu will appear and from here you can select the utility you want to run.\n\nHow does Ultimate Boot CD work? It simply creates a virtual instance of the floppy (very much similar to virtual CD/DVD drives), so that the computer reads it as a floppy drive instead of a CD drive.\n\nIf you prefer memory sticks, Ultimate Boot CD features a script that allow you to access the utilities from a removable drive in the same way as you would from the CD disc.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b7c7c254d843ba3e41b3a058b50377426fb18f1","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Boot+CD+5.2.8++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b7c7c254d843ba3e41b3a058b50377426fb18f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,124,124,37,77,132,59,163,228,27,58,5,139,80,55,116,38,251,24,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
