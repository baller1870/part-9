Read All About It\n\nEmeli SandÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s aptly-named solo debut single Heaven was arguably the finest British pop song released in 2011. The Scottish singer-songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seraphic vocal swoops and producer Shahid Ã¢â‚¬ËœNaughty BoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ KhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reassuring old-school breakbeats were warmly received by listeners, while a striking similarity to Massive AttackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Unfinished Sympathy can rarely hurt a songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05536f43454552da9a54f37a2e18cdfdf32db36a","amp;dn":"Emeli+Sand%26eacute%3B...Our+Version+of+Events%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05536f43454552da9a54f37a2e18cdfdf32db36a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,83,111,67,69,69,82,218,154,84,243,122,46,24,205,253,243,45,179,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
