For others, however, challenging a big bruin on its own turf is the purpose of their hunt and may become an obsession. Whether it involves hunting the wary black bear in Maine over bait, chasing a clever black bear trying to avoid a pack of hounds in the Rocky Mountains, sneaking up with a bow on a huge grizzly, placing the crosshairs on a massive brown bear as it exits an ice-cold Alaskan stream, or enduring bitterly cold temperatures and inhospitable hunting conditions while hunting the hunterÃ¢â‚¬â€the great white polar bearÃ¢â‚¬â€bear hunting is an adventure only for those of strong heart and mind.\n\nIn Hunting Bears, Etling covers all aspects of bear hunting and all species of bears to huntÃ¢â‚¬â€black, grizzly, brown, and polar. She omits no tactic, strategy, or bear behavior and includes interviews with many of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful bear hunters as well. Between the covers of this book is information that most bear hunters would take a lifetime to amass.\n\nIf hunting any of the bears found in North America or the world is your dream, you'll want to add Hunting Bears to your outdoor library. It will provide you hours of first-rate reading and will inspire you to bag your trophy bruin. \n\n\nBy Kathy Etling\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 192 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e8eb76415f3bba017d89d8b6701f6b14a7d1eb3","amp;dn":"Hunting+Bears+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e8eb76415f3bba017d89d8b6701f6b14a7d1eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,142,183,100,21,243,187,160,23,216,157,139,103,1,246,177,74,125,30,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
