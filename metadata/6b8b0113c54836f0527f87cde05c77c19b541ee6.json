Or be charming and relaxed on a first date? What is it about a politician who seems wooden or a comedian whose jokes fall flat or an athlete who chokes? In all of these cases, striving seems to backfire.\n\n In Trying Not To Try, Edward Slingerland explains why we find spontaneity so elusive, and shows how early Chinese thought points the way to happier, more authentic lives. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve long been told that the way to achieve our goals is through careful reasoning and conscious effort. But recent research suggests that many aspects of a satisfying life, like happiness and spontaneity, are best pursued indirectly. The early Chinese philosophers knew this, and they wrote extensively about an effortless way of being in the world, which they called wu-wei (ooo-way). They believed it was the source of all success in life, and they developed various strategies for getting it and hanging on to it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8b0113c54836f0527f87cde05c77c19b541ee6","amp;dn":"Trying+Not+to+Try%3A+The+Art+and+Science+of+Spontaneity+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8b0113c54836f0527f87cde05c77c19b541ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,139,1,19,197,72,54,240,82,127,135,205,224,92,119,193,155,84,30,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
