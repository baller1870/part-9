As many of you are fully aware, a DVD can hold only 4.7GB, thus making it impossible to burn the image on a single-layer DVD. I have created a smaller DVD image of the exact same format, only it occupies approximately 4.33GB of space. Now it is possible to burn Mountain Lion OSX on a single-layer DVD. \n\nIf your intended purpose is simply to install Mountain Lion OSX then you can do that as well, as this is the full official version from the Apple Mac store. Clean and ready for installation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb2cd521d255f1df30117d9eb1bef80321f721ba","amp;dn":"Mountain+Lion+OSX+%2ADVD+Ready%2A+-+Clean+Install","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb2cd521d255f1df30117d9eb1bef80321f721ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,44,213,33,210,85,241,223,48,17,125,158,177,190,248,3,33,247,33,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
