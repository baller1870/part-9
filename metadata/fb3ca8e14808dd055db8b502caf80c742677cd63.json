Sistas listen to songs that take them away from their problems, the burdens of school, boyfriends, work, babies, etc. Brothers bump sounds that vent out their frustrations of being African and male in America. As the weather gets hotter, I hope y&amp;#039;all dance, chill, make love, drive to the rhythm of this phat soundtrack.\nPeace, John Singleton&quot;\n\n\nPoetic Justice - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1993)\n\nGet it up - TLC\nIndo Smoke - Mista Grimm\nWell alright - Babyface\nCall me a Mack - Usher Raymond (yes, it&amp;#039;s young Usher)\nWaiting for you - Tony!
