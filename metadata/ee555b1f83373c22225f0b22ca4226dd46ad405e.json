Cinematography was by Burnett Guffey and the film was scored by George Antheil. It is based on a story by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt and stars Adolphe Menjou, Arthur Franz, Gerald Mohr, Marie Windsor and Frank Faylen. \n\nTight little drama of unhinged marksman Franz going on the rampage. Good companion piece to He Lived by Night 1948 and Targets 1968.\n\nIn the 1940s, a new style - film noir - emerged from the world of &quot;hard - boiled&quot; pulp magazines, paperback thrillers, and sensational crime movies. These films - tough and unsentimental - depicted a black-and-white universe at once brutal, erotic and morally ambiguous. \n\nFilmed in San Francisco, this Stanley Kramer production is one of the earliest studies of a murderous psychopath who kills randomly and without motive, making it almost impossible for the police to track him down. This noir pits the rationalism of law and psychiatry against the irrationality of post-traumatic stress and compulsive homicide.\n \nThis is Arthur Franz's film. His beautifully rendered portrayal of a fringe-dwelling tortured soul is a 50's noir highlight. His average looks and strong acting abilities combine to create a character not unlike a 50's 'Taxi Driver'. Psychologically alienated, he's a storm in a bottle - ill-equipped to live within societal boundaries.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.05gb\nDuration.... 01:27:59\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate....1598kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 112kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee555b1f83373c22225f0b22ca4226dd46ad405e","amp;dn":"The+Sniper+1952+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee555b1f83373c22225f0b22ca4226dd46ad405e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,85,91,31,131,55,60,34,34,95,11,34,202,66,38,221,70,173,64,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
