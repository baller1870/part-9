Created by William Bennett, they pioneered a branch of experimental noise known as &quot;power electronics,&quot; a genre explored by Japanese artists such as Merzbow. Influenced by contemporaries such as Throbbing Gristle and composers such as Alvin Lucier, Whitehouse developed a unique sound mixing high and low frequencies with aggressive bursts of electronics and vocals. With their label Come Organisation, they released what they termed &quot;the most extreme music ever made.&quot; Often subject to censorship by stores and distributors due to subject matter and graphic record designs, they never bowed to commercial pressures and remained in control of their music and label. Whitehouse has recorded with Steve Albini since 1989.\n\nWilliam Bennett played guitar in the post-punk band Essential Logic. After leaving the group, he recorded the &quot;Come Sunday&quot; single under the name Come. This groundbreaking release, sequenced by Daniel Miller, featured relentless synthesizer pulses that hinted at the sound that would later typify Whitehouse. The Come Organisation was created by Bennett to release like-minded artists, though the majority of the releases on the label involved the founder himself in some capacity.\n\nThe Whitehouse project began with the full-length Birth Death Experience with William Bennett on vocals and synthesizer, Paul Reuter on synthesizer, and Peter Mckay credited as effects and engineer. Though relatively timid compared to their later material, it is important for the formation of their unique aesthetic. Their third release, Erector, was one of the first to fully take advantage of the dynamic potential of electronic music. Considered by many as the first power electronics record, Erector set the standard for aggressive experimental noise.\n\nAware that they were staking new ground, several releases soon followed. They released eight full-length records in three years, each one being proclaimed by the Come Organisation as &quot;the most extreme music ever made.&quot; During this period, William Bennett found time to collaborate with Steven Stapleton (of Nurse With Wound) as 150 Murderous Passions, a project inspired by the Marquis De Sade.\n\nSatirizing the music industry much like Throbbing Gristle, Whitehouse went to great lengths for originality. While Throbbing Gristle operated Industrial Records as a corporation, William Bennett operated the Come Organisation as a radical libertarian political collective where personal liberty and personal pleasure was to be maintained at all costs. Referring to live performances as &quot;actions,&quot; disseminating propaganda that praised serial killers, and expressing an extreme ideology of personal pleasure via the media, Whitehouse gained a cult following based on their growing mysterious status.\n\nAlways controversial, anti-Whitehouse sentiments reached new heights in 1982. People misinterpreted the intention of William Bennett's article &quot;The Struggle For a New Music Culture&quot; published in the magazine Force Mental. Controversy surrounding the piece led to further censorship and distribution problems. Following their first U.S. tour, Whitehouse released two of their most shocking records to date: Right to Kill and Great White Death. These releases took sex and violence as lyric subject matter to unheard-of proportions with the equivalent in extreme electronic sound, and they also saw the addition of two new collaborators Kevin Tomkins and Philip Best.\n\nAfter a five-year hiatus, Whitehouse returned with a new label name and a new producer. Thank Your Lucky Stars, released on Susan Lawly in 1990, was the first for Whitehouse to be recorded by legendary producer Steve Albini. Rarely deviating from the themes outlined by Right to Kill and Great White Death, Whitehouse released several more full-lengths throughout the 1990s. Sonically they have remained true to their original sound and are still quite extreme in nature. Slowly but surely, the coveted early records by Whitehouse are being reissued on CD, sometimes as special editions with bonus tracks.\n\n1980 - Birthdeath Experience\n01 - On Top\n02 - Mindphaser\n03 - Rock and Roll\n04 - The Second Coming\n05 - Coitus\n06 - Birthdeath Experience\n\n1980 - Total Sex\n01 - Total Sex\n02 - Phaseday\n03 - Dominate You\n04 - Politics\n05 - Roller Coaster\n06 - Ultrasadism\n07 - Her Entry\n08 - Foreplay\n\n1981 - Erector\n01 - Erector\n02 - Shitfun\n03 - Socratisation Day\n04 - Avisodomy\n\n1981 - Dedicated to Peter Kurten\n01 - Ripper Territory\n02 - Prosexist\n03 - On Top\n04 - Pissfun\n05 - Rapeday\n06 - The Second Coming\n07 - Her Eternity\n08 - CNA\n09 - Dom\n10 - Dedicated to Peter Kurten\n\n1981 - Buchenwald\n01 - Buchenwald\n02 - Dedicated to Albert de Salvo -- Sadist and Mass Slayer\n03 - Incest 2\n04 - The Days of Florbelle\n\n1982 - New Britain\n01 - Movement 1982\n02 - Roman Strength\n03 - Will to Power\n04 - New Britain\n05 - Ravensbruck\n06 - Kriegsklarung\n07 - Viking Section\n08 - Active Force\n\n1982 - Psychopathia Sexualis\n01 - Peter KÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼rten\n02 - Edward Paisnel\n03 - Boston Strangler\n04 - Peter Sutcliffe\n05 - Fritz Haarman\n06 - Ian Brady &amp; Myra Hindley\n07 - Graham Young\n08 - Vulcan Air Attack Mission\n09 - Pleazure FÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼r Frauen\n10 - Live Action 4 (complete)\n11 - Genesis of the New Weapons\n\n1983 - Right to Kill\n01 - Dedicated to Dennis Nilsen\n02 - Cock Dominant\n03 - Tit Pulp\n04 - Gilles de Rais\n05 - Prorapist\n06 - Death Penalty\n07 - The Street Cleaner\n08 - Bloodfucking\n09 - Queen Myra\n10 - New Sadist\n11 - Right to Kill\n\n1985 - Great White Death\n01 - Great White Death\n02 - Ass-Destroyer\n03 - You Don't Have to Say Please\n04 - Rapemaster\n05 - I'm Coming Up Your Ass\n06 - We've Got the Power\n\n1990 - Thank Your Lucky Stars\n01 - Hungry for Pain\n02 - Thank Your Lucky Stars\n03 - Try and Be Grateful\n04 - My Cock's on Fire\n05 - Neronia\n06 - Sadist\n07 - Still Going Strong\n\n1992 - Twice Is Not Enough / Never Forget Death\n01 - To Die\n02 - Neronia\n03 - Fanatics\n04 - Heads You Lose\n05 - The White Whip\n06 - Masters of the Overviolence\n07 - Revolution\n08 - Twice is Not Enough\n09 - Never Forget Death\n10 - Now is the Time\n11 - Asking for It\n12 - Torture Chamber\n\n1994 - Halogen\n01 - Vulgar\n02 - Lightning Struck My Dick\n03 - Movement 1994\n04 - Dictator\n05 - Halogen\n06 - The Way It Will be\n\n1995 - Tokyo Halogen\n01 - Dictator\n02 - My Cock's On Fire\n03 - Hungry for Pain\n04 - Dedicated to Peter Kurten\n05 - Tit Pulp\n06 - Torture Chamber\n07 - Shitfun\n08 - Movement 1994\n09 - Halogen\n\n1995 - Quality Time\n01 - Told\n02 - Quality Time\n03 - Baby\n04 - Execution\n05 - Just Like a Cunt (Philip Best Vocal Version)\n06 - Once and For All\n\n1998 - Mummy and Daddy\n01 - Philosophy of the Wife-Beater\n02 - Worthless\n03 - A Cunt Like You\n04 - Daddo\n05 - Private\n\n2001 - Cruise\n01 - Cruise (Force the Truth)\n02 - Princess Disease\n03 - Movement 2000\n04 - Public\n05 - Scapegoat\n06 - Dance the Desperate Breath\n07 - A Cunt Like You\n\n2003 - Bird Seed\n01 - Why You Never Became a Dancer\n02 - Wriggle Like a Fucking Eel\n03 - Philosophy\n04 - Bird Seed\n05 - Cut Hands Has the Solution\n06 - Munkisi Munkondi\n\n2006 - Asceticists\n01 - Dans\n02 - Language Recovery\n03 - Guru\n04 - Nzambi Ia Lufua\n05 - Killing Hurts Gives You the Secrets\n06 - Ruthless Babysitting\n07 - Dumping the Fucking Rubbish\n\n2007 - Racket\n01 - Fairground Muscle Twitcher\n02 - Mouthy Battery Beast\n03 - Dumping More Fucking Rubbish\n04 - The Avalanche\n05 - Bahnhof\n06 - Dyad\n07 - Bia Mintatu\n\nRip Spex:\n2007 - Racket 320kbps\n2006 - Asceticists 320kbps\n2003 - Bird Seed 320kbps\n2001 - Cruise 192kbps\n1998 - Mummy and Daddy 192kbps\n1995 - Quality Time 320kbps\n1995 - Tokyo Halogen 320kbps\n1994 - Halogen 192kbps\n1992 - Twice Is Not Enough / Never Forget Death 192kbps\n1990 - Thank Your Lucky Stars 256kbps\n1985 - Great White Death 192kbps\n1983 - Right to Kill 320kbps\n1982 - Psychopathia Sexualis 256kbps\n1982 - New Britain 192kbps\n1981 - Buchenwald 192kbps\n1981 - Dedicated to Peter Kurten 320kbps\n1981 - Erector 192kbps\n1980 - Total Sex 192kbps\n1980 - Birthdeath Experience 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ce4c79343a518df64da5aefdfaa753f9dc2f69","amp;dn":"Whitehouse+-+Full+Discography+%2B+Plus+Interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ce4c79343a518df64da5aefdfaa753f9dc2f69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,206,76,121,52,58,81,141,246,77,165,174,253,250,167,83,249,220,47,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
