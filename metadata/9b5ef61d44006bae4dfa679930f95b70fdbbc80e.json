Relief for him and his disenfranchised peers comes in the form of secret after-hours boxing matches held in the basements of bars. \n\nFight Club is the brainchild of Tyler Durden, who thinks he has found a way for himself and his friends to live beyond their confining and stultifying lives. But in Tyler's world there are no rules, no limits, no brakes.\n\nTurned into a blockbuster film starring Brad Pitt and Ed Norton.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5ef61d44006bae4dfa679930f95b70fdbbc80e","amp;dn":"Chuck+Palahniuk+-+Fight+Club+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5ef61d44006bae4dfa679930f95b70fdbbc80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,94,246,29,68,0,107,174,77,250,103,153,48,249,91,112,253,187,200,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
