She owns a hip neighborhood coffee shop in a quaint, scenic beach town and her specialty is matching people to their perfect, new brew. While she's been less than successful fixing her love life, Donavan enjoys her work and has the robust support of her sister Becky (Rachel Hendrix), Becky's boyfriend Kevin (Jason Burkey) and the wonderful, eclectic family of her coffee shop regulars.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 12-Nov-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c28671eb08b498cf5db555cf62310c67d0874c08","amp;dn":"Coffee+Shop+Love+is+Brewing+2014+UPtv+SDTV+x264-POKE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c28671eb08b498cf5db555cf62310c67d0874c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,134,113,235,8,180,152,207,93,181,85,207,98,49,12,103,208,135,76,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
