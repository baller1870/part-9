The Airport Tower Simulator 2012 is the answer to your dreams.\n\nBe the one to take over the responsibility in the tower and coordinate the taking off and landing of the aircrafts. Not only are you responsible for their flight schedule, but you also have to assign them to the runway or terminal. During your work, be as efficient as possible and use your instruments Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as radar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to guarantee a flawless clearance. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only the short waiting periods on ground and the safe handling of your maneuvers that will bring you the points you need.\n\nAside from fulfilling your missions, you can also enjoy the view from the tower: here you can observe a variety of detailed and animated aircraft-types, which you can watch from near or afar. Moreover, you have the possibility to tune in into the pilotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cockpits.\n\nBut watch out! The longer you play, the higher the traffic and the more challenging your missions. In the cases of airplanes colliding on the ground, or if an airplane runs out of fuel and needs to make an emergency landing, your career will be over immediately!\n\nBut donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thanks to a save mode you can restart your missions any time you want. Airport Tower Simulator 2012 will amaze you with its 3D-graphics as well as a realistic day-night-shift. Next to preinstalled sceneries, you can create your own airports and missions and even trade them with other players with the airport-editor.\n\nGood luck in the tower.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a7026f885e3ac2c61cd94834707a55f8b43c03","amp;dn":"Airport+Tower+Simulator+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a7026f885e3ac2c61cd94834707a55f8b43c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,167,2,111,136,94,58,194,198,28,217,72,52,112,122,85,248,180,60,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
