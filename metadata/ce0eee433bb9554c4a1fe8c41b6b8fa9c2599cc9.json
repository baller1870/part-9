While it falls short of the excellence of her stunning debut, Crossroads is a heartfelt, honest offering that's well worth obtaining. Dedicated to South African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, the anthemic &quot;Freedom Now&quot; is one of Chapman's best protest songs. Equally compelling is &quot;Subcity,&quot; a lament for the poor, disenfranchised underclass that stands on the outside of the American Dream looking in. Much of the time, however, Chapman isn't going for immediacy -- introspective and subtle songs like &quot;Bridges,&quot; &quot;Be Careful of My Heart,&quot; and &quot;All That You Have Is Your Soul&quot; require at least several listens in order to be fully appreciated.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Urdgcbb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Urdgcbb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce0eee433bb9554c4a1fe8c41b6b8fa9c2599cc9","amp;dn":"Tracy+Chapman+-+Crossroads+%5B1989%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BVINYL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce0eee433bb9554c4a1fe8c41b6b8fa9c2599cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,14,238,67,59,185,85,76,74,31,232,196,27,107,143,169,194,89,156,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
