Anna Funder's bestselling Stasiland brings us extraordinary tales of real lives in the former East Germany.\n\n\nShe meets Miriam, who tried to escape to West Berlin as a sixteen-year-old; hears the heartbreaking story of Frau Paul, who was separated from her baby by the Berlin Wall; and gets drunk with the legendary &quot;Mik Jegger of the East,&quot; once declared by the authorities -- to his face -- &quot;no longer to exist.&quot; And she meets the Stasi men themselves, still proud of their surveillance methods. Funder's powerful account of that brutal world has become a contemporary classic.\n\n\nEach enthralling story depicts what it's like to live in Berlin as the city knits itself back together - or fails to. This is a history full of emotion, attitude, and complexity.\n\n\nReview:\n=======\n\n&quot;Stasiland demonstrates that great, originalreporting is still possible. . . . A heartbreaking, beautifully written book. Aclassic.&quot; -- Claire Tomalin, Guardian &quot;Books ofthe Year&quot;. \n\n\n\nAuthor:\n======\n\nAnna Funder's international bestseller, Stasiland, won the Samuel Johnson Prize for nonfiction. Her debut novel, All That I Am, has won many prizes, including the prestigious Miles Franklin Literary Award. Anna Funder lives in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband and children.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Funder&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Funder&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226369.Stasiland&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226369.Stasiland&lt;/a&gt; - 4.15/5\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f9a398efa7ab5fb7d09b93d6f5bdb8871b689d","amp;dn":"Anna+Funder+-+Stasiland%3A+Stories+from+Behind+the+Berlin+Wall.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f9a398efa7ab5fb7d09b93d6f5bdb8871b689d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,249,163,152,239,167,171,95,183,208,155,147,214,245,189,184,135,27,104,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
