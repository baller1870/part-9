The music was heavily inspired by TOTO, Journey, Starship and other West Coast bands of that time and with a twist from Supertramp, but always with a twist of pure energy and the desire to play and perform with own composed music.\n \nPowerPlay had various bass players in the first years, but after a while the young and talented Bass player Philip Stricker joined and brought new dimensions into the music. The band was constantly on the move and played in many underground places around Copenhagen like Umatic and Loppen, and became rather popular in those environments.\nSo look forward to 10 great and melodic AOR rock-songs on the album Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Those YearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nGenre: Melodic Hard Rock\n\nCountry: Denmark\n\nQuality: mp3, CBR 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. City of Love\n02. Powerplay\n03. Why Are You Running Away?\n04. Going Home\n05. All These Years\n06. Cry Freedom\n07. So What (Let Me Be)\n08. Climb a Mountain\n09.
