We were designed to be fully capable of performing any task. We were made to be resilient. We were made to be bulletproof. Somewhere along the way most of us have lost our abilities to move, to run, to climb, to play, to live. We have become broken.\n\nThis doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be. We can regain our movements. We can regain our resiliency. In Becoming Bulletproof you will learn how performing just four simple moves can help you to regain the body you were meant to have; a body that is strong, powerful, fast and graceful. A body that is capable of doing anything.\n\nWe donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be broken. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to avoid things we love to do because they cause physical pain. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to waste away because we sit in chairs for most of our lives. We can learn how to move again. We can become strong again. We can engage and enjoy our lives. We can become bulletproof!\n\nBecoming Bulletproof Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2011\nBook Language: English \nPages: 96\nFile Type: Epub, Pdf\nFile Size: 3.23 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6bfd0ae811be4439f56fd136f527904fca9d6cd","amp;dn":"Becoming+Bulletproof+-+An+Uncommon+Approach+to+Building+a+Resili","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6bfd0ae811be4439f56fd136f527904fca9d6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,191,208,174,129,27,228,67,159,86,253,19,111,82,121,4,252,169,214,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
