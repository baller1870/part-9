They are haunted by a talking dog named Labby who brings them on surreal hell-rides between different dimensions and time periods. On the night of a lunar eclipse he informs Tommy about the devil fetus living inside his mother. The same night he attempts to help Ralph court the girl across the street, who is an unwilling participant in her father's child porn tape trading ring. Add in a memory stealing junkie living inside an abandoned church and you have 90 minutes of pure mind melting insanity!\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC * HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca48a37e018a1af46120ee7bdce74d943a714cc2","amp;dn":"Where+The+Dead+Go+To+Die+%282012%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28Phre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca48a37e018a1af46120ee7bdce74d943a714cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,72,163,126,1,138,26,244,97,32,238,123,220,231,77,148,58,113,76,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
