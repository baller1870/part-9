Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nA very good translation of the medieval spiritual classic.\n\ndescription:\n\nThe spiritual classic by ÃƒÂ  Kempis, the second most widely read spiritual book after the Bible, has had an astonishing impact on the spiritual lives of countless saints, peasants, and popes for centuries. Even today, the soul-searching words of the fifteenth-century cleric Thomas ÃƒÂ  Kempis continue to resonate, unbounded by time or geography. Drawing on the Bible, the Fathers of the early Church and medieval mysticism, his four-part treatise shrugs off the allure of the material world, blending beauty and bluntness in a supremely spiritual call-to-arms. This beautiful translation by Ronald Knox and Michael Oakley is considered by many teachers, writers, and readers to be the best English translation ever, and one that greatly enhances the life-changing insights of Thomas ÃƒÂ  Kempis.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0264b149170f14be70dd1f7d25bad6314310b50","amp;dn":"Thomas+a+Kempis+-+The+Imitation+of+Christ+%28R.+Knox%2C+trans%29%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0264b149170f14be70dd1f7d25bad6314310b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,38,75,20,145,112,241,75,231,13,209,247,210,91,173,99,20,49,11,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
