No redistribution permitted.\n\nFrom Booklist\nSince JacksonÃ¯Â¿Â½s 2009 death, kids whose feelings about the artist probably varied between disinterest and dislike are now giving him new consideration. This short biography does the trick, focusing on the two sections of his life that might be most immediate to kidsÃ¯Â¿Â½his childhood and his final few yearsÃ¯Â¿Â½while rushing through JacksonÃ¯Â¿Â½s most musically fertile period (the stretch between Off the Wall and Dangerous). Krohn has a knack for honing in on kid-friendly details: It was just a coincidence that the Jacksons lived on a street that shared their family name. The shot of their humble home is striking, and itÃ¯Â¿Â½s only one of a decent number of photosÃ¯Â¿Â½roughly one per page. JacksonÃ¯Â¿Â½s early career is the highlight here: his busting of black stereotypes, his signing to Motown (misspelled once as Mowtown), and the abuse at the hands of his father. The accusations of molestation are kept factual but fairly abstract, as is his death. The layout is a bit drab, but this is a snappy read with some fine back matter, too. Grades 4-6. --Daniel Kraus\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nThis book will not only become a collectible, it is an excellent biography about Michael Jackson for the younger set!\nBy D. Fowler HALL OF FAMETOP 10 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on February 16, 2010\nMost high school talent shows can be a little blah at best. Someone may get up and dance a bit, play a musical instrument or sing a bit off key. The talent show held in 1966 at Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana was a bit different and on one level a history maker. A young boy named Michael got up on stage with his brothers and sang. He later said that &quot;For him, singing was as natural as breathing.&quot; His parents Joseph and Katherine were musical so it only made sense that their children would inherit that love and some ability, but this boy had something special. It was obvious when he began to sing and moved to the beat that Michael Jackson was a child prodigy with enormous potential. Needless to say, the Jackson boys won that talent show.\n\nYou will read about the Jackson family and how they broke into the music world. Michael later claimed that his father was an abusive task master, but you will also read about how he worked to purchase instruments for them. Gladys Knight saw something in the group and claimed &quot;she'd put in a good word for them with Berry Gordy, Jr., the owner of Motown Records.&quot; You'll learn how Michael learned to dance by watching the pros, how they got to perform at the Apollo Theater, how they got a record contract, you'll read about their appearances on the Ed Sullivan show, how thrilled Michael was to be the star of his own cartoon show, you'll learn about the Neverland Ranch, the scandal, his generosity, his children and much more!\n\nThis book will not only become a collectible, it is an excellent biography about Michael Jackson for the younger set. There are numerous photographs, both black and white and full color, many I had never seen, especially the earlier ones\n\nChild appropriate biography\nBy gorme1and2 on November 9, 2011\nWhen my 3rd grader got to choose a person to read and write a biography on, I was quite concerned when he picked Michael Jackson. This isn't to say that he isn't a talented and interesting person to read about, but some of the alleged issues aren't very child friendly. Where this book is a short overview and perfectly readable to my gifted 3rd grader, it touched on his court issues in an appropriate manner. If a parent wants to explain it more in depth, they can. His life was so much more then those moments so there are many other items to read about. If you are looking for a comprehensive biography, this is not it. If you are looking for the &quot;cliff notes&quot; version that is child friendly, this is the only biograpy I found that fits the bill","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c07fd7df4c730957b83382c72cae54f7fb7c9602","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+Ultimate+Music+Legend+%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c07fd7df4c730957b83382c72cae54f7fb7c9602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,127,215,223,76,115,9,87,184,51,130,199,44,174,84,247,251,124,150,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
