This fun romp brings back von Dracula and his pals - this time they have invented Vampisol, a formula that allows vampires to flourish in daylight. Rival vampire clans in the form of Chicago gangsters and German Nazis fight for possession of the formula, just as they did over possession of Cuba. The scene shifts to the Russian front (don't ask), then we go to the Kremlin and meet Stalin...\n\nThe plot is so convoluted that you're better to just let it wash over you, especially since I don't have English subtitles - maybe someone can find some.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc255be72394233b11cb5a00dc74be5b3eeb8536","amp;dn":"Mas+Vampiros+en+La+Habana+%282003%29+More+Vampires","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc255be72394233b11cb5a00dc74be5b3eeb8536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,37,91,231,35,148,35,59,17,203,90,0,220,116,190,91,62,235,133,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
