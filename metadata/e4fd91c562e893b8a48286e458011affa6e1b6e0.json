This is mine.\n\nThis is not an official update. I simply (to the best of my ability) chronologically inserted all the newest releases since version 3.0 (Including 'Woodstock Forty Years On/Back to Max Yasgur's/Limited Edition Box Set', as well as Johnny Winter, Jefferson Airplane and Santana's Woodstock Experience CDs). \n\nLike all the other versions of Woodstock Complete, there are most certainly errors. Hell, mistakes are part of the fun. I wasn't there. I wish I was, but I wasn't... and chances are, neither were you. \n\nI did my best to insert all the newest tracks where I thought they belonged. I also edited some older tracks to remove redundancies.\n\nI have no doubt the official version 4.0 will be out soon (with clips from the extended movie and more), but until then, enjoy this!\n\nThere are 316 files in this compilation and it lasts over 24 hours if you play it straight through from beginning to end.\n\nIt took me 3 days to compile all the info and metadata for the tracks.\n\nI converted the original songs from .FLAC to 160kb MP3 for one simple reason, to keep the metadata intact. \n\nIf you want .FLAC quality recordings, you can find almost everything you need here on The Pirate Bay, but it will take you a long time to assemble and update everything from version 3.0 to present... and you will need to tag every single song. \n\nIt takes a long... Long... LONG time.\n\n\n\nDisc 24 is a bonus disc with extra sound clips not used in the rest of the compilation. It is a great disc. Disc 24 alone is worthy of any collection.\n\n\n\nMy thanks to everyone who has had a hand in this project.\n\nRecreating The Complete Woodstock, one song at a time, is an amazing hobby! \n \nSeed this piece of history for as long as possible.\n\nIf you notice any errors, please post them in the comments section.\n\nI will do what I can (within reason) to keep this upload as accurate as possible.\n\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
