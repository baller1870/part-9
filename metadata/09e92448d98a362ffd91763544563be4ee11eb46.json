Trading futures, on the other hand, carries with it the risk of losing\r\nmore than your original investment because you are leveraged 100% of the time.\r\nHowever, the risk is easily eliminated by setting, and sticking with, a suitable stop\r\nloss strategy. This strategy is implemented at the time of entry. It is also essential to stay in contact with your trade. As intraday traders, that should be no problem.\r\nUsing these two simple rules, a sound stop loss strategy and monitoring your\r\nposition, a trader is able to participate in highly liquid and volatile markets with\r\nminimal outlay and at no greater risk than trading stocks or property.\r\n\r\nWhat is Leveraging?\r\n\r\nTrading futures with leverage positions enables your money to work much more\r\nefficiently. You are able to control a large amount of capital for a fraction of the\r\nactual cost, effectively using a down payment, or â€˜marginâ€™ to trade. When you sell\r\na long position, or cover a short, you collect or pay the difference between the\r\nentry and exit prices without having to outlay the entire contractâ€™s value.\r\n\r\nWhy is Day Trading a Great Tool to Financial Freedom?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter where you live or what hours you keep, there are markets trading\r\nsomewhere every minute of every day, five days a week. Readily available\r\ninternet technology allows virtually anyone to trade on an equal footing with the\r\n'big players'. In fact, the days of large financial institutions 'having an edge' are\r\nlong gone. You can now see what they see as they see it. You can take the same\r\ntrades they take. But you have one very big advantage... you're small!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09e92448d98a362ffd91763544563be4ee11eb46","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Day+Trading.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09e92448d98a362ffd91763544563be4ee11eb46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,233,36,72,217,138,54,47,253,145,118,53,68,86,59,228,238,17,235,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
