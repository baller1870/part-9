Though CCR was very much a group in their tight, punchy arrangements, their vision was very much singer, songwriter, guitarist, and leader John Fogerty's. Fogerty's classic compositions for Creedence both evoked enduring images of Americana and reflected burning social issues of the day. The band's genius was their ability to accomplish this with the economic, primal power of a classic rockabilly ensemble.\n\nThe key elements of Creedence had been woodshedding in bar bands for about a decade before their breakthrough to national success in the late '60s. John's older brother Tom formed the Blue Velvets in the late '50s in El Cerrito, CA, a tiny suburb across the bay from San Francisco. By the mid-'60s, with a few hopelessly obscure recordings under their belt, they'd signed to Fantasy, releasing several singles as the Golliwogs that went nowhere. In fact, there's little promise to be found on those early efforts, primarily because Tom, not John, was doing most of the singing. The group only found themselves when John took firm reigns over the band's direction, singing and writing virtually all of their material. \n\n\nHere are two CDs containing 40 tracks -- all of Creedence Clearwater Revival's singles along with album cuts -- selected and sequenced by European rock journalist Lennart Persson, an intimate of John Fogerty. The big pluses are that these tracks are the remastered versions (in 24 bit), the sequencing is unique and provocative, and the music itself, as you already know if you are reading this, is killer. This is arguably a better issue than the American Chronicle series because of the new dimension added by not placing tracks chronologically. \n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1. Green River \t\n2. Fortunate Son \t\n3.
