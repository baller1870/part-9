It has become known for its engaging writing style, instructional art program and focus on active learning. We are so excited to offer a robust learning program with student-focused learning activities, allowing the student to manage their learning while you easily manage their assessment. Detailed reports show how your assignments measure various learning objectives from the book (or input your own!), levels of BloomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Taxonomy or other categories, and how your students are doing. The Cowan Learning program will save you time and improve your students' success in this course.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 - The Main Themes of Microbiology 1\n2 - The Chemistry of Biology 27\n3 - Tools of the Laboratory: The Methods for Studying Microorganisms 55\n4 - Prokaryotic Profiles: The Bacteria and Archaea 80\n5 - Eukaryotic Cells and Microorganisms 108\n6 - An Introduction to the Viruses 139\n7 - Microbial Nutrition, Ecology, and Growth 168\n8 - Microbial Metabolism: The Chemical - Crossroads of Life 198\n9 - Microbial Genetics 232\n10 - Genetic Engineering and Recombinant DNA 268\n11 - Physical and Chemical Control of Microbes 297\n12 - Drugs, Microbes, HostÃ¢â‚¬â€The Elements of Chemotherapy 327\n13 - Microbe-Human Interactions: Infection and Disease 362\n14 - Host Defenses I: Overview and Nonspecific Defenses 397\n15 - Host Defenses II: Specific Immunity and Immunization 424\n16 - Disorders in Immunity 459\n17 - Diagnosing Infections 490\n18 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Skin and Eyes 512\n19 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Nervous System 550\n20 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems 584\n21 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Respiratory System 622\n22 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Gastrointestinal Tract 660\n23 - Infectious Diseases Affecting the Genitourinary System 708\n24 - Environmental Microbiology 741\n25 - Applied Microbiology and Food and Water Safety 762\n\nNOTE\nIn case you are not able to open this PDF with Adobe reader, please use the free Foxit reader to open it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c4d545179058a1e27ee67cc4cf9ada9c7f447a","amp;dn":"Microbiology+-+A+Systems+Approach+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c4d545179058a1e27ee67cc4cf9ada9c7f447a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,196,213,69,23,144,88,161,226,126,230,124,196,207,154,218,156,127,68,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
