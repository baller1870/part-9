Since the mid-'60s, Jones has sung nearly every form of popular music -- pop, rock, show tunes, country, dance, and techno, he's sung it all. His actual style -- a full-throated, robust baritone that had little regard for nuance and subtlety -- never changed, he just sang over different backing tracks.  ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:09ftxqw5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:09ftxqw5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThis imported budget-priced four-CD set containing 88 songs isn't quite as &quot;ultimate&quot; as one would think, but it's a start. The material is all drawn from Jones' late-1970s/early-1980s network television specials, including a handful of numbers with Tina Turner, Dionne Warwick, Tanya Tucker, and Denise Williams -- stylistically, it's sort of Jones' equivalent to Elvis' NBC comeback special, multiplied by four, and there is surprisingly little filler. The sound, which was never intended to be heard digitally, or over anything bigger than a television speaker, is somewhat compressed at times, but that doesn't detract from the performances.  ....\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
