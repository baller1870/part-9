There are tales of the risk-takers, such as the man who wagers his daughter's hand in marriage to a wine connoisseur, or the traveller who throws himself overboard on a cruise liner to win a bet. Here too is the understated cruelty of &quot;Edward the Conqueror,&quot; in which a mysterious cat seems to threaten domestic life, or the innocuous-seeming &quot;Landlady,&quot; whose guests stay for longer than they intend. Not forgetting the satisfyingly shocking tales of revenge, such as &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; or &quot;Lamb to the Slaughter.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b1f53bea11021f6eb378f28b39129bfad8a0ac0","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Unexpected+-+Roald+Dahl.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b1f53bea11021f6eb378f28b39129bfad8a0ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,31,83,190,161,16,33,246,235,55,143,40,179,145,41,191,173,138,10,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
