Formed by vocalist Brandon Boyd, lead guitarist Mike Einziger, and drummer Jose Antonio Pasillas II while in high school in 1991, the band grew to include bassist Alex Katunich (a.k.a. &quot;Dirk Lance&quot;), and Gavin Koppell (a.k.a. &quot;DJ Lyfe&quot;), both of whom were eventually replaced by bassist Ben Kenney (formerly of The Roots), and DJ Kilmore, respectively.\n\nIncubus is known for its eclectic sound, balancing experimental and progressive qualities with pop appeal, earning praise for their ability to change and evolve their music with each successive release. The band's lyrics touch on a number of different subjects, from their earliest works which touch on drugs and anti-conformity to the later albums where lyrics tend to focus politics and romance, although primarily stressed with an optimistic view.\n\nIncubus has received both critical acclaim and commercial success, reaching multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several highly successful singles. The band started branching out creatively and earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album Make Yourself. By 2001, Incubus became hugely successful with the single &quot;Drive&quot; and their follow up album Morning View. Their latest studio album, Light Grenades, debuted at #1 in 2006 and has received Gold certification in the U.S. Incubus has sold 16 million albums worldwide, and are set to release their first greatest hits album Monuments and Melodies in June 2009, accompanied by a tour of the United States.\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Incubus       \nAlbum     -  A fuckin' shit load                                          \nGenre     -  Alternative Rock                                             \nLabel     -  various\nYear      -  1991 - present                                            \nTracks    -  n/a                                               \nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  1.28 Gig\nkbps      -  VBR / 192 or higher\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nI will seed my torrents for about one week.
