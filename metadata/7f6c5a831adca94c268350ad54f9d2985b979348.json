D. Laing (Author)\n\nThis book is an exploration of some aspects of the relations between persons. The first part examines different modes of experience as forms of relationships. In the second part, some key patterns of interaction are considered, especially those that characterise certain extreme forms of disturbance or breakdown of relationships. \n\nThe author has drawn on diverse sources, on psychoanalysis, phenomenology, on American studies of families, and on the insights of drama and the novel. His study includes a detailed critique of technical psychoanalytic paper on fantasy; a close examination of the experience of Raskolnikov before his crime, and of his relations with his mother and sister; and analysis of aspects of Genet's play The Balcony, and a concise summary of the &quot;double bind&quot; theory. \n\nThis is a thoroughly revised edition of a book originally published in 1962, but rarely known in America at the time. This edition makes available one of R.D. Laing's major works, a book to read alongside The Divided Self.\n\nISBN-10: 1199367737\nISBN-13: 978-1199367730","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f6c5a831adca94c268350ad54f9d2985b979348","amp;dn":"%28Selected+Works+of+R.D.+Laing%2C+2%29+1998++-++Self+%26amp%3B+Others++%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f6c5a831adca94c268350ad54f9d2985b979348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,108,90,131,26,220,169,76,38,131,80,173,84,249,210,152,91,151,147,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
