In this one-of-a-kind account, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see how the developers responsible for these flaws patched the bugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or failed to respond at all. As you follow Klein on his journey, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll gain deep technical knowledge and insight into how hackers approach difficult problems and experience the true joys (and frustrations) of bug hunting.\n\nAlong the way youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to:\n\nUse field-tested techniques to find bugs, like identifying and tracing user input data and reverse engineering\nExploit vulnerabilities like NULL pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and type conversion flaws\nDevelop proof of concept code that verifies the security flaw\nReport bugs to vendors or third party brokers\nA Bug HunterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Diary is packed with real-world examples of vulnerable code and the custom programs used to find and test bugs. Whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hunting bugs for fun, for profit, or to make the world a safer place, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn valuable new skills by looking over the shoulder of a professional bug hunter in action.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
