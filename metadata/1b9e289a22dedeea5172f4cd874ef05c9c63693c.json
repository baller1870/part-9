But he is called back into action to confront the toughest villain he's ever faced - Owen Davian, an international weapons and information provider with no remorse and no conscience. Hunt assembles his team: his old friend Luther Strickell, transportation expert Declan, and background operative Zhen. They are to rescue one of his very own trainees, Lindsey who was kidnapped while on a surveillance detail of Davian. It soon becomes evident that Davian is well-protected, well-connected, and downright malicious. This forces Hunt to extend his journey back into the field in order to rescue his wife, Julia, and uncover IMF double agents in the process.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Screenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img696.imageshack.us/img696/6369/2908037missionimpossibl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img696.imageshack.us/img696/6369/2908037missionimpossibl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/504/2908045missionimpossibl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/504/2908045missionimpossibl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/5424/2908046missionimpossibl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/5424/2908046missionimpossibl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/416/2908042missionimpossibl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/416/2908042missionimpossibl.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9e289a22dedeea5172f4cd874ef05c9c63693c","amp;dn":"Mission+Impossible+Trilogy+-+720p+-+MKV.X264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9e289a22dedeea5172f4cd874ef05c9c63693c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,158,40,154,34,222,222,234,81,114,244,205,135,78,240,92,156,99,105,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
