The first four tracks on this album were all hits in the American country charts, these being How was I to know (about recovering from a broken relationship and feeling better than ever), The fear of being alone (about a couple spending time together to avoid being alone), What if it's you (in which a woman discovers that a man is unavailable and wonders if she'll find somebody else) and I'd rather ride around with you (about somebody who is supposed to be at her cousin's wedding but prefers to be riding around with her man).\n\nThe other songs - all excellent - are It don't matter (about a relationship that appears to be in trouble despite - or because - the couple having everything they need), State of Grace (about a woman who packs in her regular job for a bit of adventure), Close to crazy, Just looking for him (two songs about women unable to get over losing a man), She's calling it love (about a woman who is infatuated with a man who takes advantage of her) and Never had a reason to (about a woman who didn't do what the others did - fall in love, get married and raise a family - but eventually finds love).\n\nReba has recorded so many great albums in her career and this is one of them. It has more of a country feel to it than some her nineties albums though it still has a pop sheen to it. If you enjoy Reba's nineties music, you should buy this album.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nReba McEntire - What If It's You\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Reba McEntire\nAlbum................: What If It's You\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
