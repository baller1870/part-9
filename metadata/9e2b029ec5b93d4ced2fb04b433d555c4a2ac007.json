This book brings together eleven original essays by an inter-disciplinary team of historians, political theorists and international relations specialists that reconsider some of those contributions and their legacies. It aims to provide new insights into the work of thinkers from Thomas Hobbes and Edmund Burke to Goldsworthy Lowes and Lewis Namier as well as to advance the study of the history of international thought.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is an informative addition to the literature responding to the current renewed interest in the history of the discipline. By taking as its temporal scope the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries, it constitutes a healthy reminder that our contemporary theorizing on IR rests on a long-developing pattern of inquiry and that the most recent expression of an observation may not constitute the most profound or apt formulation. By taking as its geographical/cultural/political scope the writings of British international thinkers, it recognizes the need for focus in such an investigation, and it provides a ready-made response to the inevitable special pleaders who would ask, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBut where is my favorite writer?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Given the increasing attention paid to the contributions of the English School to IR theory, it is both a timely intervention and a valuable resource.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--David Clinton, Professor of Political Science, Baylor University\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nIan Hall is Senior Lecturer of International Relations, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia.
