File sizes vary according to how static the images in the program are.\n\n* Each file is approximately 50 - 52 minutes running time. Total running time is about 6 hours.\n\n* Aspect ratio is 4:3\n\n* First broadcast in the UK about 10 years ago. Hard to obtain now as a box set.\n\n* Being about music, these files would not lose that much content as audio-only - if someone wants to extract the audio and just upload those mp3 files as a separate torrent - be my guest.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3a1f4735b458dc03bdc940d227f96e75074ed5","amp;dn":"Simon+Rattle+-+Leaving+Home+%287+Part+Television+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3a1f4735b458dc03bdc940d227f96e75074ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,58,31,71,53,180,88,220,3,189,201,64,210,39,249,110,117,7,78,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
