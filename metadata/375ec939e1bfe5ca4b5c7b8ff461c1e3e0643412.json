Things were looking upÃ¢â‚¬Â¦until he opened \n\nhis mouth. Daemon Black is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-\n\nworthy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hate at first sight, but when a stranger \n\nattacks her and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave \n\nof his hand, well, somethingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦unexpected happens. The hot \n\nguy next door? Well, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an alien. Turns out that Daemon \n\nand his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal \n\ntheir abilities and Katy is caught in the crosshairs. \n\nDaemonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s touch has lit her up like the Vegas Strip and the \n\nonly way sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting out of this alive is by sticking \n\nclose to him until her alien mojo fades. That is if she \n\ndoesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill him first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375ec939e1bfe5ca4b5c7b8ff461c1e3e0643412","amp;dn":"Obsidian%3AA+Lvel+by+Jennifer+L.+Armentrout%7E%21InDigEnoUs%21%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375ec939e1bfe5ca4b5c7b8ff461c1e3e0643412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,94,201,57,225,191,229,202,75,92,123,143,244,97,193,227,224,100,52,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
