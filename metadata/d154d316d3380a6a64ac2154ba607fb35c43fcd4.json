The first is a collection of a bunch of books essential to anyone who wants to lean more about the Linux operating system.  It has books organized into the following categories (with number of books in parentheses):\n\nEssential books (26)\nEssential Networking (8)\nIDS Firewall &amp; Security (16)\nCore Linux Concepts (7)\nDNS (5)\nBSD &amp; Unix (6)\nCluster (3)\nLDAP (1)\nMail Servers (4)\nNFS &amp; NIS (1)\nSamba (1)\nSELinux (2)\nSquid (1)\nSSH &amp; VPN (4)\nApache (6)\n\nThe second has 264 unsorted general computer books.  It contains books on things like Windows, security (never thought I'd use &quot;Windows and security in the same sentence!), BitTorrent, hacking, UNIX, Linux, programming (especially C++), and more.  There might be duplicates between the two parts, but not many.\n\nMost of the e-books are in either PDF or CHM format, with a few being TXT (and one DOC and DjVu).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d154d316d3380a6a64ac2154ba607fb35c43fcd4","amp;dn":"Linux+Book+Collection+%28plus+264+general+computer+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d154d316d3380a6a64ac2154ba607fb35c43fcd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,84,211,22,211,56,10,106,100,172,33,84,186,96,127,179,92,67,252,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
