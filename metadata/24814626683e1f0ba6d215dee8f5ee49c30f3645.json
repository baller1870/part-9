Intercut with a 1972 interview of Waters are clips from his first films and recent interviews with his parents, his brother, Divine's mom, actors and crew, other directors, film critics, a film curator, psychologists, and Maryland's last censor, who shudders at the memory of Waters's pictures. Also included is footage of Waters making his early movies, culminating in an up-close and in-depth look at Pink Flamingos: the script, the set, the filming conditions, its editing, its distribution, and its impact. In sweet ways, this documentary is also a celebration of Divine (1945-1988).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24814626683e1f0ba6d215dee8f5ee49c30f3645","amp;dn":"Divine+Trash+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24814626683e1f0ba6d215dee8f5ee49c30f3645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,129,70,38,104,62,31,11,166,210,21,222,232,245,238,73,195,15,54,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
