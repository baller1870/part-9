The smartphone is poised to take on a new role in medicine, no longer as a mere medical app but rather as a fully customizable personal physician capable of diagnosing and treating even better than the real thing. It is called iDoc.\n\nGeorgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial collision with this incredible innovation is devastating. He awakens one morning to find his fiancÃƒÂ©e dead in bed alongside him, not long after she participated in an iDoc beta test. Then several of his patients die after undergoing imaging procedures. All of them had been part of the same beta test.\n\nIs it possible that iDoc is being subverted by hackersÃ¢â‚¬â€and that the U.S. government is involved in a cover-up? Despite threats to both his career and his freedom, George relentlessly seeks the truth, knowing that if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, the consequences could be lethal.\n\nepub and mobi. enjoy and seed.
