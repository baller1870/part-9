Published on behalf of the British Dietetic Association, the UK professional body for dietitians, it covers the entire dietetics curriculum and is also an ideal reference text for qualified practitioners.\n\nThe book has been extensively restructured for its fifth edition and is now divided into two parts to make it easier to locate key topics. The first part covers professional practice, nutrition in specific groups, nutritional status and non-clinical areas of dietetic practices, while the second focuses on clinical dietetic practice, including nutrition support, and dietetic practice in individual areas of disease, from respiratory and renal disorders to mental health and palliative care. This edition also offers a companion website, www.manualofdieteticpractice.com, which includes case studies, discussion vignettes to place topics in a clinical context, downloadable copies of the appendices, key tables and figures, and references and useful links.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67c6f833d1102e9c3021ca48cc292248e814ccdc","amp;dn":"Manual+of+Dietetic+Practice%2C+5E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67c6f833d1102e9c3021ca48cc292248e814ccdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,198,248,51,209,16,46,156,48,33,202,72,204,41,34,72,232,20,204,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
