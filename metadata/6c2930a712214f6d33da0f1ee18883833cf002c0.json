Today, porn is everywhere, but where is it art? 25,000 Years of Erotic Freedom surveys the history of pornography and argues that the success and vibrancy of a society relates to its permissiveness in sexual matters.\nThis history of erotic art brings together some of the most provocative illustrations ever published, showcasing the evolution of pornography over diverse cultures from prehistoric to modern times. Beginning with the Venus of Willendorf, created between 24,000-22,000 bce, and book-ended by contemporary photography, it also contains a timeline covering major erotic works in several cultures. 25,000 Years of Erotic Freedom ably captures the ancient and insuppressible creative drive of the sexual spirit, making this book a treatise on erotic art.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Alan_Moore_(2).jpg/220px-Alan_Moore_(2).jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Alan_Moore_(2).jpg/220px-Alan_Moore_(2).jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nAlan Moore lives in Northampton, England, and is most famous for his influential work in comics, including the acclaimed comic books Watchmen, V for Vendetta, and From Hell.
