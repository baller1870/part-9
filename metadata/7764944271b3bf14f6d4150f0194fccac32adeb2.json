Initially known in Australia for their pub rock style, they later achieved mainstream success playing new wave and synthpop music and attained Top 10 singles chart success in both Europe and the U.S.[1] The mainstay of both Flowers and Icehouse has been Iva Davies (singer-songwriter, record producer, guitar, bass, keyboards, oboe)[2] supplying additional musicians as required. The name Icehouse, which was adopted in 1981, comes from an old, cold flat Davies lived in and the strange building across the road populated by itinerant people.[3]\n\nDavies and Icehouse extended the use of synthesizers particularly the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 (&quot;Love in Motion&quot;, 1981), Linn drum machine (&quot;Hey Little Girl&quot;, 1982) and Fairlight CMI (Razorback trailer, 1983) in Australian popular music.[1][3][4][5][6] Their best known singles on the Australian charts were &quot;Great Southern Land&quot;, &quot;Hey Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Electric Blue&quot; and &quot;My Obsession&quot;; with Top Three albums being Icehouse (1980, as Flowers), Primitive Man (1982) and Man of Colours (1987).[1][7]\n\nIcehouse's iconic status was acknowledged when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006.[8][9][10] ARIA described Icehouse as &quot;one of the most successful Australian bands of the eighties and nineties... With an uncompromising approach to music production they created songs that ranged from pure pop escapism to edgy, lavish synthesised pieces...&quot;[10] Icehouse has produced eight Top Ten albums and twenty Top Forty singles in Australia, multiple top ten hits in Europe and North America and album sales of over 28 times Platinum in Australasia alone.[10] As of 2006, Man of Colours was still the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian band.\n\n\n\n\nWhite Heat - 30 Hits 2011\n\n\nWhite Heat: 30 Hits is a two-disc compilation album released by Australian band Icehouse on 26 August 2011 in Australia. While it is technically their third best-of compilation, following 1989's Great Southern Land and 1992's Masterfile (not counting a singles box set released in the mid-1990s that was not widely distributed), it is the first such compilation spanning the band's entire career, including both their early- to mid-1980s hits and material from their most commercially successful period, beginning with the Man of Colours album.\n\nThe album presents the band's complete singles catalogue, all in chronological order, with 15 tracks on each disc. There is also a 3-disc edition which includes a DVD featuring all 32 of the band's music videos, also in chronological order. The DVD contains a 5.1 mix in Dolby Digital AC-3. The compilation was announced on 7 July 2011, in a press release by Universal Music.[1]\n\nFollowing the release of the Flowers Icehouse 30th Anniversary edition earlier this year, I was overwhelmed by the incredible amount of support and enthusiasm there was out there for the entire Icehouse catalogue. Many of the requests for what to put out next focused around some of the compilations we had released in the past.\n\nI looked at the past sets and realised that there had never been a collection of every single weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever released throughout the history of the band nor a DVD compilation of every clip so thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we decided to do. Our criteria for the inclusion of tracks was that they had to have been released somewhere in the world as a single AND have had a clip made for them (in a couple of cases, two clips!). (Iva Davies, speaking in the press release).\n\nThe album artwork was designed by Sydney design studio Debaser, and features the laser cage in which Iva Davies performed in during the band's time as Flowers. This can be seen in the &quot;Flowers Folio&quot; section of the band's website.\n\nThe tracks were remastered by Steve Smart at Studios 301 Mastering.\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\t&quot;Can't Help Myself&quot; (as Flowers)\n2.\t&quot;We Can Get Together&quot; (as Flowers)\n3.\t&quot;Walls&quot; (as Flowers)\n4.\t&quot;Icehouse&quot; (as Flowers)\n5.\t&quot;Love In Motion&quot; (Original Single Mix)\n6.\t&quot;Great Southern Land&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Hey, Little Girl&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Street Cafe&quot; (Single Mix)\n9.\t&quot;Glam&quot; (Single Version)\n10.\t&quot;Taking the Town&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Don't Believe Anymore&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Dusty Pages&quot; (Single Version)\n13.\t&quot;No Promises&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Baby, You're So Strange&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Mr Big&quot;  \n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n1.\t&quot;Cross the Border&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Crazy&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Electric Blue&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;My Obsession&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Man of Colours&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Nothing Too Serious&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Touch the Fire&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Jimmy Dean&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Big Fun&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Miss Divine&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Anything Is Possible&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Satellite&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Big Wheel&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Invisible People&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Love In Motion&quot; (with Christina Amphlett)\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7764944271b3bf14f6d4150f0194fccac32adeb2","amp;dn":"Icehouse+-+White+Heat+-+Greatest+Hits+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7764944271b3bf14f6d4150f0194fccac32adeb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,100,148,66,113,179,191,20,246,212,21,15,1,148,252,202,195,42,222,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
