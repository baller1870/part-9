ISOs are required to play the game otherwise the sound/cutscenes will be messed up so don't delete them after installing.\n\nI'm just a Star Wars fan that had a hard time finding a good download of this game, so I've made it easier for fellow Star Wars fans.\n\nHave fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e947b333a19684b4737b9eac147b50a00d7efe9","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Jedi+Knight%3A+Dark+Forces+II+%2B+Mysteries+of+the+Sith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e947b333a19684b4737b9eac147b50a00d7efe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,148,123,51,58,25,104,75,71,55,185,234,193,71,181,10,0,215,239,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
