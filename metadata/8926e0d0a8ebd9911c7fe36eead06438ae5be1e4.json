Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nNonfiction work on philosophy and intellectual history by the great Christian novelist.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nIn this ambitious book, acclaimed writer Marilynne Robinson applies her astute intellect to some of the most vexing topics in the history of human thoughtÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶science, religion, and consciousness. Crafted with the same care and insight as her award-winning novels, Absence of Mind challenges postmodern atheists who crusade against religion under the banner of science. In RobinsonÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s view, scientific reasoning does not denote a sense of logical infallibility, as thinkers like Richard Dawkins might suggest. Instead, in its purest form, science represents a search for answers. It engages the problem of knowledge, an aspect of the mystery of consciousness, rather than providing a simple and final model of reality.\n\nBy defending the importance of individual reflection, Robinson celebrates the power and variety of human consciousness in the tradition of William James. She explores the nature of subjectivity and considers the culture in which Sigmund Freud was situated and its influence on his model of self and civilization. Through keen interpretations of language, emotion, science, and poetry, Absence of Mind restores human consciousness to its central place in the religion-science debate.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nRobinson's new nonfiction work is drawn from her 2009 Terry lectures at Yale. More precisely, they are &quot;lectures on religion in the light of science and philosophy.&quot; The charge is ambitious, and Robinson brings to the task a suitably wide-ranging perspective. She takes aim at the modern scholarly propensity to debunk, a practice she calls &quot;flawed learnedness.&quot; It pitches out the babies of human insight with the bathwater of the past, preferring what she calls &quot;parascience,&quot; a kind of pseudoscience that prizes certainty. This &quot;parascience&quot; is a latecomer in human thought, the product of only the last 150 years or so. Because it closes off questions, it's not even scientific. Nor does it allow space for the human mind and all the mind has produced in history and civilization. This is heady stuff that will particularly appeal to those familiar with the history of ideas and the many thinkers she cites, and to anyone willing to ponder broadly and humanistically about imponderable matters. Those who savor Robinson's clear prose will also be gratified; her mind, in thought, is elegant.
