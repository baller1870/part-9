Great vhs/tv-rip quality.\n\nCo-directed by Peter Greenaway and Tom Phillips. Greenaway is best known for such films as The DraughtsmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Contract (1982), A Zed and Two Noughts (1985), The Belly of an Architect (1987), The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover (1989), and The Pillow Book (1996), Phillips, a composer, artist and critic, is perhaps best known for his interest in the art of the page. His 1983 translation of the Inferno is used for the production. (The rest of the Inferno has been divided among directors Raul Ruiz, Terry Gilliam, Zbig Ribzynski and Nagisa OshimaÃ¢â‚¬â€Vickers has worked with only the first eight cantos.)\nThe title of A TV Dante was clearly studied to put in play the high cultural register now evoked by the name Ã¢â‚¬ËœDanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the low cultural register evoked by TV.\n\n\nFile Name .............: [Peter Greenaway, Tom Phillips &amp; Raoul Ruiz] [1989] A TV Dante.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 722,157,568 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 01:29:20 (160646 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: DivX 5.0\nFrame Size ............: 512x384 () [=] [=1.333]\nFPS ...................: 29.971\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1006 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.171 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[N-VOP]...[]...[GMC]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 64 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR audio\nInterleave ............: 33 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324158ce18a32f9856940ea7c2fcd9a9d349fd7f","amp;dn":"A+TV+Dante+%28Peter+Greenaway+%26amp%3B+Tom+Phillips%2C+1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324158ce18a32f9856940ea7c2fcd9a9d349fd7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,65,88,206,24,163,47,152,86,148,14,167,194,252,217,169,211,73,253,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
