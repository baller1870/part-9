This powerful yet affordable program supports over 1500 scanners and 321 digital camera RAW file types, and is available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.\n\nMuch more than a simple scanner program, VueScan allows you to perform functions such as color restoration, adding sharpening filters, adjusting white balance, rotating images, and batch scanning multiple images. It also provides output to a variety of formats including TIFF, JPEG, and searchable PDF files (even all three simultaneously). The Pro version outputs to the RAW format and provides options for color adjustments, and more.\n\nDespite its popularity, the documentation for VueScan does not provide enough information to use the full power of the system and makes it difficult to get started. The VueScan Bible is the missing manual for new, experienced, and prospective users of VueScan.\n\n\nPaperback: 176 pages\nPublisher: Rocky Nook; 1 edition (June 28, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1933952695\nISBN-13: 978-1933952697","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52cc5a40a14d3670359e8ad7de8f6a13c0c617c6","amp;dn":"The+VueScan+Bible+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52cc5a40a14d3670359e8ad7de8f6a13c0c617c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,204,90,64,161,77,54,112,53,158,138,215,222,143,106,19,192,198,23,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
