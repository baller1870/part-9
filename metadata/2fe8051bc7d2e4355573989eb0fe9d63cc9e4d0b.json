The group was founded by Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber while they were aided during live shows by Rick Mars, Johnny Kreis, Steve Darrow and Andre Troxx. Rose, Stradlin and Weber, along with Kreis, recorded a five-song demo in 1984. However after a number of lineup changes, which includes Weber and Kreis being replaced by Slash and Steven Adler (both then of Road Crew) respectively as well the departure of Stradlin, the group disbanded the same year.\n\nHollywood Rose reunited briefly in 1985 with Rose, Stradlin, Weber and Darrow returning and adding former L.A. Guns drummer Rob Gardner to the group. L.A. Guns founder Tracii Guns eventually replaced Weber. They changed their name to Guns N' Roses (combining the names of L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose) with L.A. Guns bassist Ole Beich replacing Darrow. Eventually Guns, Gardner and Beich were replaced by former Hollywood Rose members Slash, Adler and their former Road Crew band mate Duff McKagan with this lineup becoming known as the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Guns N' Roses.\n\nThe five-song demo, recorded in 1984, was released in 2004 with the title The Roots of Guns N' Roses. A number of Hollywood Rose material were included on the albums Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide (1986), Appetite for Destruction (1987), Live from the Jungle (1987) and G N' R Lies (1988) released by Guns N' Roses.\n\nAnd of course since Slash dont need anybody He uses everybody and does it well ,Axl well 1 full length and 1 live album mans he needs a reunion so we may see it next year maybe or we will get old and die before anything happens, look how long we waited for Chinese Democracy\n\nMembers\n\n    Axl Rose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (1983-1984, 1985)\n    Izzy Stradlin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar (1983-1984, 1985)\n    Chris Weber Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar (1983-1984, 1985)\n    Johnny Kreis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (1983-1984)\n    Rick Mars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1983)\n    Andre Troxx Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1983)\n    Steve Darrow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1983-1984, 1985)\n    Slash Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar (1984)\n    Steven Adler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (1984)\n    Rob Gardner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (1985)\n    Tracii Guns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar (1985)\nSlash Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, co-rhythm guitar acoustic guitar on &quot;November Rain&quot;, backing vocals on &quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot;, &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;,  talkbox on &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;,\nIzzy Stradlin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, backing vocals, acoustic guitar  lead vocals on &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;, \nDuff McKagan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals, \nMatt Sorum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion on &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;, and &quot;Coma&quot;, backing vocals on &quot;November Rain&quot; and  choir on &quot;November Rain&quot;\nDizzy Reed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, piano,  backing vocals on &quot;November Rain&quot;,  organ on &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot; \n\nTracklist is below &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/EE9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/EE9&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe8051bc7d2e4355573989eb0fe9d63cc9e4d0b","amp;dn":"Hollywood+Rose+And+L.A.+Guns+-+The+Roots+And+The+Seeds+Of+Guns+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe8051bc7d2e4355573989eb0fe9d63cc9e4d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,232,5,27,199,210,228,53,85,115,152,158,176,254,157,99,204,158,77,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
