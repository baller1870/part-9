The album contains hits from between Bon Jovi (1984) and Keep the Faith (1992) and two new tracks: the hit singles &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;, as well as a new, updated rendition of &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; entitled &quot;Prayer '94&quot; available only on the North American versions. &quot;Runaway&quot; was never recorded with the current band, though at that time there were plans to put a &quot;Runaway '94&quot; on the album but it was never recorded. The diner located on the cover of the album is the Roadside Diner in Wall Township, NJ, near the crossroads of Route 33 and Route 34.\n\n&quot;Always&quot;, the album's first single, became Bon Jovi's highest selling single in the U.S., spending six months on the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 and was also an international hit which helped the album peaking at number one in 13 countries. Cross Road was the best-selling album of 1994 in UK. \n\nThe album is Bon Jovi's best selling record in many countries, and continues to sell well. The album has sold over 21.5 million copies worldwide, and has been cited as one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n\nCD (1)\nNo. \t\t\n1. &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; (Slippery When Wet) \t                 4:11\n2. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (Keep the Faith)     \t                 5:45\n3. &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot; (New song) \t                 4:38\n4. &quot;Always&quot; (New song)                  \t                 5:52\n5. &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; (Slippery When Wet) \t                 5:07\n6. &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; (New Jersey)   \t                 5:58\n7. &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; (Slippery When Wet)                3:43\n8. &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (Keep the Faith) \t                         6:34\n9. &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; (Blaze of Glory)           \t                 5:40\n10. &quot;In These Arms/Prayer'94/Tokyo Road&quot;(KTF/New song/7800Ã‚Â°F...) 5:16\n11. &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; (New Jersey)                                \t 5:14\n12. &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot; (New Jersey) \t                 5:41\n13. &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; (7800Ã‚Â° Fahrenheit) \t                 4:23\n14. &quot;Runaway&quot; (Bon Jovi) \t                                 3:50 \n15. &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; (Slippery When Wet)                      4:50\n\nCD (2)\n2005 Deluxe Sound &amp; Vision Bonus CD. \t\nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;The Radio Saved My Life Tonight&quot;   \t\t         5:08\n2. \t&quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;   \t\t                 3:55\n3. \t&quot;Diamond Ring&quot;   \t\t                         3:46\n4. \t&quot;Good Guys Don't Always Wear White&quot;   \t\t         4:30\n5. \t&quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; (Thin Lizzy cover)  \t 4:04\n6. \t&quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot;   \t\t                 4:35\n7. \t&quot;Postcards from the Wasteland&quot; (Demo)  \t                 4:24\n8. \t&quot;Blood on Blood&quot; (Live) \t \t                 6:49\n9. \t&quot;Let It Rock&quot;   \t\t                         5:23\n10. \t&quot;Starting All Over Again&quot;   \t \t                 3:44\n11. \t&quot;Blood Money&quot; (Live) \t\t                         2:27\n12. \t&quot;Save a Prayer&quot;   \t \t                         5:56\n13. \t&quot;Lucky&quot; (Demo) \t\t                                 3:47\n14. \t&quot;Why Aren't You Dead?&quot;   \t \t                 3:32\n15. \t&quot;Raise Your Hands&quot;   \t \t                         4:15\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72f95e8297ff252563fe37764aea5806e0663c4","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+1994+-+Crossroad+%2B+Limited+Edition%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenovatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72f95e8297ff252563fe37764aea5806e0663c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,47,149,232,41,127,242,82,86,63,227,119,100,174,165,128,110,6,99,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
