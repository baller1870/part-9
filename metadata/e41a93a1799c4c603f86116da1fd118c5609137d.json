Author Jim Lesko gives you the practical knowledge you need to develop a real-world understanding of materials and processes and make informed choices for industrial design projects.\n\nIn this book, you will find everything from basic terminology to valuable insights on why certain shapes work best for particular applications. You'll learn how to extract the best performance from all of the most commonly used methods and materials.\n\n\nBy Jim Lesko\nPublished by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 2007\nEPUB, Retail, 256 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e41a93a1799c4c603f86116da1fd118c5609137d","amp;dn":"Industrial+Design%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e41a93a1799c4c603f86116da1fd118c5609137d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,26,147,161,121,156,76,96,63,134,17,109,161,253,17,140,86,9,19,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
