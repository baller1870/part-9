He is known for combining traditional Netherlandish painting techniques with influences of more contemporary Renaissance painting styles.\n\nAn active member and co-deacon of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp, he is known mostly for his religious works and portraits of royalty. As a skilled technician, his art shows sensitivity to color and a unique solidarity of figures. He was one of the first to introduce broad landscapes in the backgrounds of his paintings, which would become a popular technique of sixteenth century northern Renaissance paintings.\n\nHe was the father of Cornelius or Cornelis van Cleve (1520-1567) who was also a painter and is believed to have suffered from a mental illness and was therefore referred to as 'Sotte Cleef' (mad Cleef)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f920f6e8f58facf7dfafe7f7d421432240d0f64","amp;dn":"Joos+van+Cleve+%281485+-+1540%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f920f6e8f58facf7dfafe7f7d421432240d0f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,146,15,110,143,88,250,207,125,250,254,127,125,66,20,50,36,13,15,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
