Make sure your computer is set to Japanese Locale (Control Panel &gt; Regional &gt; System Locale) before attempting to run VP. If not, AppLocale and NTLEA will both work, provided you rename the game folder. \n2. Follow instructions on the following page.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://poverty.mizuumi.net/wiki/VP_FAQ#Technical&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://poverty.mizuumi.net/wiki/VP_FAQ#Technical&lt;/a&gt;\n\n******************************************\n\nNetplay: \n\nLunaPort instructions are in the Readme.txt in the game folder. Its contents are included below: \n\n\n\n\nLunaPort r49 Readme\n\n\nLunaPort is an original netplay application for the free game Vanguard Princess,\nmade by Suge9. The game can be downloaded via the author's blog at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suge9.blog58.fc2.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suge9.blog58.fc2.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nLunaPort might also work with other games, which use the same engine, as long as\nthe game exe is exactly identical to the one used by Vanguard Princess.\n\nPlease note that LunaPort is still in early developement, so some versions might\nnot work at all. Only testing can tell.\n\nIt is released under the GPLv3 or later. Feel free to tinker, improve, etc.\nMagic in the header file is &quot;explained&quot; in src/gore.txt\n\nThe netcode seems to be reasonable these days.\n\nIf you want to send me a bug report, patch or anything, just drop it into: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lunaport.pastebin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lunaport.pastebin.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nIf you want to get older versions of LunaPort, you might find them at:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n0) Do not touch the Game menu. If you already touched it, get a pristine copy\n   of game.ini before even trying this. Set up your controls outside of\n   LunaPort, i.e. run the game normally and use the keyboard/joystick config.\n1) If you have customized P2 controls, make a backup of your game.ini, might\n   get overwritten with P1 controls, although that shouldn't happen.\n2) Also, don't try to change any controls in the menu while playing with\n   LunaPort. Bad things will happen and the changes won't be saved anyway.\n\nLess important notes:\n3) I only have a single PC this game runs on, so I couldn't really test\n   LunaPort. Please help me out here.\n4) As long as the game exe is the same, other games might work too, but you have\n   to adjust the Stages and Blacklist settings in lunaport.ini\n5) Delay is counted in input requests, not frames. There are 100 input requests\n   per sec, so 1 delay is 10ms.\n6) If the standard filename for the game exe is not found, game.exe is tried.\n   You can also specify the filename for the game exe in lunaport.ini\n\nUsage:\nPretty much like caster, even though LunaPort is not based on it. By default,\nit uses port 7500 UDP. Use option one to host a game, option two to join a\ngame, and option three to play a local VS games with random stage selection.\nDon't forget to put LunaPort.exe into the game folder.\nYou can use the --local commandline switch to start local VS mode with random\nstages directly. You can give a .rpy file as a commandline argument to watch it\ndirectly.\n\nReplay playback controls:\nQ: Toggle pause\nW: Reset game speed to normal, unpause\nE: Slow down game speed\nR: Speed up game speed\n\nKnown working: r11, r35-r36, r38-r43, r44-r48\n(These versions have been used successfully to play Vanguard Princess.)\n\nPlease excuse the desync problems from before. Things should be better now.\n\nSome notes about differences from r38 to r40-r49:\nIn r39 much of the netcode has been rewritten, to make transmission of data\nbetween peers much easier. In r40, this has been used to add lots of checks\nabout game data to the handshake. These changes also made a protocol version\nbump necessary, meaning that r38 and newer versions cannot interoperate. The\nadditional checks are for the main game KGT file and stage settings. These were\nthe main two reasons for desynchronized gameplay. Playing with different stage\nsettings (e.g. one player with Stages=5 vs another player with Stages=7) can\nwork synchronized for a couple of round, if you are lucky, but will eventually\ndesync the game. Using different versions of the game (e.g. v1.02 vs 1.03b) will\nbe even worse. Both conditions are not checked for in r38, which can make it\nappear to work better (it connects), but will lead to eventual desync. Using the\nmost recent versions should be much safer. Games that would otherwise desync\nwill not be possible at all and result in an error message from the start.\n\nNow, let's hope this works. Once it does, I might even get around to cleaning\nup the code.\n\nA GUI version can be found at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://code.google.com/p/lunaportw/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://code.google.com/p/lunaportw/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vp.mizuumi.net/index.php/Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vp.mizuumi.net/index.php/Main_Page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vp.mizuumi.net/index.php/Lunaport&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vp.mizuumi.net/index.php/Lunaport&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vanpri.wikiwiki.jp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vanpri.wikiwiki.jp/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vanpri.wikiwiki.jp/?%C4%CC%BF%AE%C2%D0%C0%EF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vanpri.wikiwiki.jp/?%C4%CC%BF%AE%C2%D0%C0%EF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jbbs.livedoor.jp/otaku/12852/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jbbs.livedoor.jp/otaku/12852/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAcknowledgements:\nlibcurl - Copyright (c) 1996 - 2009, Daniel Stenberg, &lt;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;472326292e222b072f263f3f693422&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&gt;.\nlibz - Copyright (C) 1995-2004 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler\nCRC32 implementation - Copyright (C) 1986 Gary S.
