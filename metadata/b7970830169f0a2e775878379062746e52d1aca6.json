From the Leo Sayer penned numbers of Daltrey's solo debut to his more recent live recordings; GOLD is a good representation of Daltrey's work. Never putting together the most cohesive work on his own, this package is probably the best way to get a taste of Daltrey's work away from The Who. His strongest cuts like Steve Gibbons's &quot;One of the Boys&quot; that plays like a sequel to &quot;My Generation&quot; and Downes and Parr's tribute to Keith Moon &quot;Under a Raging Moon,&quot; stand with any of Daltrey's best vocals from The Who and you'll find any number of interesting songs here like Daltrey covering Springsteen's &quot;Born to Run&quot; and a soulful Daltrey singing Ballad's &quot;Proud&quot; in full out R&amp;B mode. This set should satisfy anyone's curiosity about Daltrey's solo work and it stands as a nice companion to his stunning work with The Who.
