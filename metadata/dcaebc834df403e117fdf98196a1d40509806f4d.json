Though they are primarily a Southern rock band, they are also known as a hard rock act. The band's classic lineup consisted of guitarist and vocalist Rickey Medlocke, guitarist Charlie Hargrett, bassist Greg T. Walker, and drummer Jakson Spires.\n\nThey've had a number of successful albums during the 1970s and early 1980s, including Strikes (1979), Tomcattin' (1980) and Marauder (1981).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStrikes is the third studio album by the American Southern rock band Blackfoot, released in April 1979. The album has received from the RIAA a platinum certification in April 1986. The album features two minor pop hits: Highway Song (#26) and Train, Train (#38).\n\nBand Members:\n\n\nRickey Medlocke: lead vocals, guitar\nCharlie Hargrett: guitar\nGreg T. Walker: bass guitar, keyboards, vocals\nJakson Spires: drums, percussion, vocals\n\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\n\nPat McCaffrey: keyboards\nShorty Medlocke: harmonica (track 8)\nCub Koda: harmonica (track 9)\nDonna D. Davis: backing vocals\nPamela T. Vincent: backing vocals\nCynthia M. Douglas: backing vocals\nHenry &quot;H-Bomb&quot; Weck: percussion, recording engineer, producer\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTomcattin' is the fourth studio album of Southern rock band Blackfoot, released in 1980. The album found Blackfoot continuing its roll down the rock highway, spawning crowd-pleasers like raucous &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme,&quot; and the rowdy (and randy) &quot;Fox Chase&quot; the latter of which features granddad Shorty Medlocke. While the album did not spawn any hit singles, it was enough to keep the band's devoted fan base loyal and strong, it remains a popular staple in Blackfoot's catalogue.\n\n\nBand:\n\nRickey Medlocke: lead vocals, guitar\nCharlie Hargrett: guitar\nGreg T. Walker: bass guitar, keyboards, vocals\nJakson Spires: drums, percussion, vocals\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarauder is the fifth studio album of Southern rock band Blackfoot, released in 1981.\n\nThe album continued in the same vein as their previous successes, &quot;Strikes&quot; and &quot;Tomcattin`&quot;. Opening up with the heavy &quot;Good Morning&quot;, and including the ballad &quot;Diary Of A Workingman&quot;, &quot;Marauder&quot; showcases a range of depth and variety allied to their tried and trusted Southern rock. &quot;Marauder&quot; also sported the hit &quot;Fly Away&quot;, which reached #42, and another triumphant Shorty Medlocke appearance on the energetic &quot;Rattlesnake Rock n' Roller&quot;, this time with a spoken introduction and banjo solo. Album closer &quot;Searching&quot; is another entry to the Southern rock canon of slow building guitar epics, in the manner of Lynyrd Skynyrd's &quot;Freebird&quot;, and their own &quot;Highway Song&quot;. &quot;Marauder&quot; was the last of their albums that were purely hard, driving, rock - they unsuccessfully introduced synthethizers to their sound through the 1980s, and their popularity waned. Eduardo Rivadavia describes &quot;Marauder&quot; as &quot;...one of the band's best hard rockers to date&quot;, and &quot;the last great Blackfoot album&quot;.\n\nThe band officially broke up amid declining fortunes in the mid-80's, though Medlocke resumed recording under the name Blackfoot a few years later. He is now, again, a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\n\nBand:\n\nRickey Medlocke: lead vocals, guitar\nCharlie Hargrett: guitar\nGreg T.
