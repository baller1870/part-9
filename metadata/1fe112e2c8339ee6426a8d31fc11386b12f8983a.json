The album peaked at number 7 on the UK charts and made it to number 8 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart. The Who By Numbers features titles &quot;Slip Kid&quot;, &quot;Dreaming from the Waist&quot; and hit single &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; that made it to number 16 on the U.S. Billboard Pop Singles and 10 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n\n The Who by Numbers functions as Pete Townshend's confessional singer/songwriter album, as he chronicles his problems with alcohol (&quot;However Much I Booze&quot;), women (&quot;Dreaming From the Waist&quot; and &quot;They Are All in Love&quot;), and life in general. However, his introspective musings are rendered ineffective by Roger Daltrey's bluster and the cloying, lightweight filler of &quot;Squeeze Box.&quot; In addition, Townshend's songs tend to be underdeveloped, relying on verbosity instead of melodicism, with only the simple power of &quot;Slip Kid,&quot; the grace of &quot;Blue Red and Grey,&quot; and John Entwistle's heavy rocker &quot;Success Story&quot; making much of an impact.  \n\n\n 01 - Slip Kid\n 02 - However Much I Booze\n 03 - Squeeze Box\n 04 - Dreaming From The Waist\n 05 - Imagine A Man\n 06 - Success Story\n 07 - They Are All In Love\n 08 - Blue Red And Grey\n 09 - How Many Friends\n 10 - In A Hand Or A Face\n 11 - Squeeze Box\n 12 - Behind Blue Eyes\n 13 - Dreaming From The Waist\n\n Remastering engineer: Jon Astley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe112e2c8339ee6426a8d31fc11386b12f8983a","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+The+Who+By+Numbers+%281975%29+%5BHDTracks+24-96%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe112e2c8339ee6426a8d31fc11386b12f8983a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,225,18,226,200,51,158,230,66,106,141,49,252,17,56,107,18,248,152,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
