They caused considerable controversy with the sexual themes in their work, particularly on their 1989 album As Nasty As They Wanna Be.\n\n\nThe 2 Live Crew was created by DJ Mr. Mixx (David Hobbs) with fellow rappers Fresh Kid Ice (Chris Wong Won), and Amazing V. (Yuri Vielot). The group released its first single, &quot;Revelation&quot;, in 1985. &quot;Revelation&quot; was popular in Florida, so The 2 Live Crew (sans Amazing V) relocated to Miami. Rapper Brother Marquis (Mark Ross) joined The 2 Live Crew for its next single &quot;What I Like&quot;. Local rapper Luke Skyywalker (Luther Campbell) gave The 2 Live Crew a record deal and worked as the group's manager and then lead vocalist.[7] The 2 Live Crew's debut album, The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are, was released in 1986. Alex Henderson of allmusic commented that the album &quot;did take sexually explicit rap lyrics to a new level of nastiness&quot;, with tracks such as &quot;We Want Some Pussy&quot; and &quot;Throw The 'D'&quot;.[8] With word-of-mouth attention, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 1987, a Florida store clerk was acquitted of felony charges for selling the album to a 14-year-old girl.[7]\n\nCampbell decided to sell a separate clean version in addition to the explicit version of the next album, Move Somethin' (1988), produced by Mr. Mixx. A record store clerk in Alexander City, Alabama, was cited for selling a copy to an undercover police officer in 1988. It was the first time in the United States that a record store owner was held liable for obscenity over music. The charges were dropped after a jury found the record store not guilty.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy the foul mouthed 2 Live Crew :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ee1ea2f49ed16a1d8102e745f16dd30b9c7aef9","amp;dn":"2+Live+Crew+-+Discography+1986+-+1998+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ee1ea2f49ed16a1d8102e745f16dd30b9c7aef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,225,234,47,73,237,22,161,216,16,46,116,95,22,221,48,185,199,174,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
