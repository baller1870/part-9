Students)(3rd Ed)\nBy V. G. Ranade, Dr. P. N. Joshi, Shalini Pradhan\nP.V.G. Prakashan  | June 1981 | ISBN-N/A | PDF | xxi + 904 pages | 26.7 mb\nscanned to PDF by me.\n\n&quot;Practical Physiology&quot; is expected to fill in the need for a book that does not merely list the instruments required for an experiment or enumerate the\nsteps necessary for its performance but deals with basic principles involved and the interpretations to which the results of such experiments lend themselves.\nAll teachers of Physiology in Medical Colleges know how teaching of experimental physiology has been handed down from one to another in the form of traditions and not infrequently an enquiring mind finds it hard to rationalise the experimental approach or the interpretations of results. Often the techniques advocated have been those that have been passed on from one generation of teachers to another perhaps with some modifications justified or otherwise.\nThe book has been well written and profusely illustrated by diagrams which include some original kymographic records. The author's personal experience in the field is evident in almost all chapters. Throughout the book the contents have been supplemented with appropriate diagrams, figures, charts, tables and illustrative material.\nPerhaps, the most interesting chapters are those on clinical examination of the human subject to illustrate the normal parts and their functionsÃ¢â‚¬â€the normal pulse, respirations, venous pulse, apex beat, normal heart sounds, normal sensations, power and functions of muscles, tendon reflexes, cranial nerves and their functions etc. The anatomical and physiological data in this connection is carefully presented. All this has been well done facilitate the to introduction of the student to the next stage of his studies - clinical work with sick patients in the wards.\n\nThis is a 3-in-1 volume:\nVOLUME ONE - Animal Experimentation\nVOLUME TWO - Human Physiology\nVOLUME THREE - Physiological Chemistry\n\nAt 900+ pages, this is the longest book that I have scanned so far over past 4 years and its fully book-marked &amp; OCRed. Though it was published over 30 years back, I hope medical students of today will find it equally useful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c9010a1608bf06455192a99cd586d1497ed1ff0","amp;dn":"A+Textbook+of+Practical+Physiology+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c9010a1608bf06455192a99cd586d1497ed1ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,144,16,161,96,139,240,100,85,25,42,153,205,88,109,20,151,237,31,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
