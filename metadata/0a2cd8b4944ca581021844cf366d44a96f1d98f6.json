Use the &quot;SETUP&quot; program from the CD to install COSIMIR Educational.\n2. To deinstall COSIMIR use the &quot;Control Panel&quot; applet &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot;\nunder Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 / Windows 2000.\n\n\n\nFirst Steps\n===========\nWhen starting this EDUCATIONAL version a help page is opened, which gives an outline of the \nworkcell models loadable with this EDUCATIONAL version. From this page the individual models \ncan be loaded by clicking on the picture or the folder symbol. \nIf you closed this help page page, you can reopen it any time again \nby using the menu item &quot;Help / Workcells of COSIMIR Educational&quot;.\n\nSee the important &quot;Special Note&quot; on this starting page to handle the download dialog as\nwell as problems if having NULLSOFT WinAmp installed.\n\nDuring installation a link to the COSIMIR online help is created in the start/programs\nmenu. Use this to get further information on working with COSIMIR.\n\n\n\nRendering under Windows 95/98\n=============================\n1. COSIMIR runs on Windows 95/98 and uses OpenGL. The required DLLs will be installed\nby the Setup program.\n2. To get maximum display speed in the workcell windows take care of the following hints:\n2.1 Avoid High-color (32768 or 65536 colors) display modes. The preferred color\ndepth is 256 colors; even TRUE color (24 bit or 32 bit) is faster than\nHigh-color.\n2.2 The larger the workcell windows, the slower the rendering speed.\n2.3 In a large workcell window the rendering speed can be significantly reduced\nby a filled floor.\n\nRendering under Windows NT/ Windows 2000\n========================================\n1. COSIMIR is using OpenGL, that is part of Windows NT, on Windows NT, too.\nThis OpenGL implementation uses the 3D acceleration capabilities of quite a lot\ngraphics boards like the\n- Elsa Erazor, all versions\n- Elsa Gloria, Elsa Winner 2000/Office\n- Diamond FireGL 1000 (pro), 2000, 3000, 4000\n\n\nProblems with Rendering of Workcell Windows\n===========================================\nThe 32 bit versions of COSIMIR employ OpenGL for graphical display of workcells. \nThe OpenGL implementations delivered with some operating systems (Windows 98, \nWindows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or higher) are faulty and will not work\ncorrectly with COSIMIR. In this case the workcells will be rendered with wrong or \nvery dark colors.\nThis fault will not be obvious, if graphics boards with an ICD OpenGL driver (e.g.\nDiamond FireGL 1000pro, ELSA Gloria, ELSA Winner 2000/Office) are used.\nThe update &quot;InstallOpenGlAndCTL3D.exe&quot; will replace the OpenGL-DLL in the windows system directory \nby a new one from Microsoft. This replacement does not work on Windows 2000.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n=============\n1. You can not edit or load robot programs (IRL, MRL, MELFA Basic,...) that are larger\nthan 64 kBytes under Windows 95/98 due to a limitation in Windows 95/98.\nThis limitation does not exist for COSIMIR under Windows NT and Windows 2000!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2cd8b4944ca581021844cf366d44a96f1d98f6","amp;dn":"Cosimir+Robotic+Programming.rar+%28Lazy_Khan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2cd8b4944ca581021844cf366d44a96f1d98f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,44,216,180,148,76,165,129,2,24,68,207,54,109,68,169,111,29,152,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
