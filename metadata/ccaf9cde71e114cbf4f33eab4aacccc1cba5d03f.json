Not the nicest scenery at all but its something. tested and working. If you have an AI traffic program that provides AFCAD files for airports then you must rename that bgl to .off. I use MTX 5.4 and needed to rename the Br2_FAJS.bgl to .off extension or else you will get get scenery overlap. This scenery gets installed into your FSXSceneryAfri folder, should you want to mess with the bgls or disable stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccaf9cde71e114cbf4f33eab4aacccc1cba5d03f","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+NMG+Tradin+Johannesburg+FAJS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccaf9cde71e114cbf4f33eab4aacccc1cba5d03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,175,156,222,113,225,20,203,244,243,62,171,74,172,204,193,203,165,208,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
