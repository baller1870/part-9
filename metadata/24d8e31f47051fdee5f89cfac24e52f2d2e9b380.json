His very progressive ideas about structure and harmony, some of it derived in part from Berlioz, met with vehement hatred from the critics, and he only found strong support abroad. At home, he was forced to make a living first as an orthopedic surgeon, and then as the manager of a glass factory. Towards the end of his life he was offered and accepted the professorship of composition at Stockholm Conservatory, only to have it withdrawn several days later. The royal family had to step in to nip the scandal in the bud, and he was reinstated. Of the two symphonies offered here, the Singulaire is the more interesting, and also one of the most original in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nIgor Markevitch was an avant-garde composer and conductor, who after devoting much of his youth to composition, turned his back on it during the horrors of World War II, and focused exclusively on conducting. He was notable for the intensity and drive of his readings.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBios of Berwald and Markevith enclosed.
