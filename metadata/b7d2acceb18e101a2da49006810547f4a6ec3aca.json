It offers practical, real-world insight and pragmatic no-nonsense approaches for people who have a stake in corporate IT. &quot;\n--Lynda Applegate, Henry R. Byers Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School\n\n&quot;Information systems and processes are very important parts of our due diligence assessment of a company--yet the jargon is often more difficult to understand than many foreign languages. Baschab and Piot effectively translate IT into words and concepts that businesspeople can easily understand and act upon. This book is a helpful reference guide for corporate executives and private equity groups of all types.&quot;\n--Neal Aronson, Managing Partner, Roark Capital Group\n\n&quot;Business success increasingly depends on effective use of IT. Effective use of IT depends on the kind of in-depth, practical insight in this book. Baschab and Piot provide a pragmatic approach to information systems investment that should be required reading for senior executives and CIOs alike.&quot;\n--Erik Brynjolfsson, Schussel Professor of Management, Director of the Center for Digital Business, MIT\n\n&quot;This book should provide valuable guidance for management and technology consultants. The Executive's Guide to Information Technology provides field-proven insight on all important aspects of IT planning and execution, from governance to applications to operations and infrastructure.&quot;\n--Gary J. Fernandes, former vice chairman, EDS, member of the Board of Directors, Computer Associates\n\n&quot;Baschab and Piot do a great job of laying out the fundamental issues and challenges that every IT organization faces. More often than not, the issues are not technical in nature, but are a reflection of how the IT and business teams work together to define, execute, and implement new business tools. The threshold issue is leadership. Often it is difficult for business leaders to feel that they have the skills and perspective to provide that leadership on technical projects. The Executive's Guide to Information Technology provides non-technical business leaders a solid framework for engaging with their IT peers.&quot;\n--Tom Nealon, Chief Information Officer, J.C.
