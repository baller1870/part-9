It is notable for an elaborately staged crane shot Hitchcock devised towards the end of the film, which identifies the real murderer.\n\nCAST:-\nNova Pilbeam as Erica Burgoyne\nDerrick De Marney as Robert Tisdall\nPercy Marmont as Colonel Burgoyne\nEdward Rigby as Old Will\nMary Clare as Erica's Aunt\nJohn Longden as Inspector Kent\nGeorge Curzon as Guy\nBasil Radford as Erica's Uncle\nPamela Carme as Christine\nGeorge Merritt as Detective Sergeant Miller\nJ.

Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word.\n\nThe next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of. Saddled with a despondent barrister, Tisdall doubts if his innocence will ever be established. He elects to take advantage of a crowded courthouse and make his escape.\n\nTisdall coerces Erica Burgoyne (Nova Pilbeam), daughter of the local police Chief Constable, to give him a ride in her Morris car. Though she is initially unsure about her passenger, Burgoyne eventually becomes convinced of his innocence and elects to help him in any way that she can. They are eventually spotted together, forcing both to stay on the run. Tisdall tries to prove his innocence by tracking down the stolen coat.\n\nThe duo succeed in tracking down Old Will (Edward Rigby), a sociable china-mender and bum that was known to have received Tisdall's coat. He agrees to help them find the man who gave him the coat; unfortunately, all that Old Will can remember about the man is his distinctive eye twitch.\n\nUpon searching the pockets of the coat, Erica finds a box of matches from the Grand Hotel, a place Tisdall has never been to. She is separated from the group, however, and taken in by the police. Upon realising that his daughter has fully allied herself with the murder suspect, her father chooses to resign his position as Chief Constable rather than arrest her for assisting Tisdall. Nonetheless, Erica and Old Will go to the Grand Hotel together, hoping to find the true murderer. In a memorably long, continuous sequence, the camera moves forward through the hotel ballroom, finally focusing on the drummer in a dance band performing in blackface. Recognizing Old Will in the audience, and seeing policemen nearby (unaware that they have followed Old Will in the hopes of finding Tisdall), the man performs poorly due to fear and a drug he has been taking to try to control the twitching, and is berated by the musical conductor. Eventually the drummer faints in the middle of a performance, drawing the attention of Erica and the policemen. Immediately after being revived and confronted, he confesses his crime and begins laughing hysterically.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 82 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 82 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc299bb171fc26bdda7e2fa3291d8c2b3777eaee","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+Classics+-+Young+and+Innocent+%281937%29+Xvid+1cd+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc299bb171fc26bdda7e2fa3291d8c2b3777eaee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,41,155,177,113,252,38,189,218,126,47,163,41,29,140,43,55,119,234,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
