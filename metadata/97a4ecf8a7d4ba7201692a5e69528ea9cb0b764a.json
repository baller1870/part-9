If she so much as kisses Seth Mortensen, the shy, sexy, incredibly gifted Seattle writer she's been dating, she'll drain his life force. Georgina is a succubus-a demon who draws her power from other men's pleasure. Admittedly, the shapeshifting and immortality perks are terrific, and yes, Georgina did choose to join the ranks of hell centuries ago. But it seems completely unfair that a she-demon whose purpose is seduction can't get hot and heavy with the one mortal who knows and accepts her for who she is.\n\nIt's not just her personal life that's in chaos. Doug, Georgina's co-worker at a local bookstore, has been exhibiting bizarre behavior, and Georgina suspects that something far more demonic than double espressos is at work. She could use help finding out, but Bastien, an irresistibly charming incubus and her best immortal friend, is preoccupied with corrupting an ultra-conservative talk radio star-and giving Georgina some highly distracting come-hither vibes. Georgina is going to have to work solo on this one-and fast because soon, Doug's life won't be the only one on the line.\n\nPraise for Richelle Mead and Succubus Blues.\n\n&quot;An engaging read.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jim Butcher, New York Times bestselling author\n\n&quot;Deliciously wicked! Dysfunctional, funny, and sexy.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Lilith Saintcrow, author of Dead Man Rising\n\n&quot;What an incredible debut novel! Succubus Blues is exciting, witty, sexy, intriguing and had me captivated from the first page.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cheyenne McCray, author of Seduced by Magic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a4ecf8a7d4ba7201692a5e69528ea9cb0b764a","amp;dn":"Mead%2C+Richelle+-+Georgina+Kincaid+02+-+Succubus+on+Top-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a4ecf8a7d4ba7201692a5e69528ea9cb0b764a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,164,236,248,167,212,186,114,1,105,42,94,105,82,142,169,203,11,118,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
