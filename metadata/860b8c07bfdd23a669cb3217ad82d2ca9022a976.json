John Wesley Harding was recorded around the same time as (and shares many stylistic threads with) a prolific series of home recording sessions with The Band, finally released in 1975 as The Basement Tapes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:860b8c07bfdd23a669cb3217ad82d2ca9022a976","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+John+Wesley+Harding+%5B1967%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"860b8c07bfdd23a669cb3217ad82d2ca9022a976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,11,140,7,191,221,35,166,105,203,50,23,173,130,210,202,144,34,169,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
