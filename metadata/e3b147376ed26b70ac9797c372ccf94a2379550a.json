It is signed by M. P. Calhoun, the most reclusive author in the country.\n\nAs a child, Regina was captivated by CalhounÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Secret of Magic, a novel in which white and black children played together in a magical forest.\n\nOnce down in Mississippi, Regina finds that nothing in the South is as it seems. She must navigate the muddy waters of racism, relationships, and her own tragic past. The Secret of Magic brilliantly explores the power of stories and those who tell them.
