Along with signature pieces of national identityÃ¢â‚¬â€such as finely crafted wood pieces, splendid mirrors, and grandmere's well cared for linensÃ¢â‚¬â€European mid-century modern furnishings also adorn settings in this age of merging sensibilities. Homes photographed in France and the U.S. show abstract works of art mingling easily with painted furniture, budget-friendly finds from assorted culturesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as wool rugs and hand embroidered linens from IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â€and pottery, artisan-made pillows, throws and vintage textiles from remote markets in Morocco.\n\n\nBy Betty Lou Phillips\nPublished by Gibbs Smith in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 240 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1771e39c92ca31045af079d581990424025578","amp;dn":"The+French+Way+with+Design+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1771e39c92ca31045af079d581990424025578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,23,113,227,156,146,202,49,4,90,240,121,213,129,153,4,36,2,85,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
