Yet shy of fame and never one to steal the spotlight Armstrong was always reluctant to discuss his personal side of events. Here for the first time is the definitive story of NeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life of flight he shared for five decades with a trusted friend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jay Barbree.\n\nWorking from 50 years of conversations he had with Neil, from notes, interviews, NASA spaceflight transcripts, and remembrances of those Armstrong trusted, Barbree writes about NeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three passions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ flight, family, and friends. This is the inside story of Neil Armstrong from the time he flew combat missions in the Korean War and then flew a rocket plane called the X-15 to the edge of space, to when he saved his Gemini 8 by flying the first emergency return from Earth orbit and then flew Apollo-Eleven to the moonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sea of Tranquility.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc550923b2166053a021cf3d90a617fc80e74063","amp;dn":"Neil+Armstrong%3A+A+Life+of+Flight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc550923b2166053a021cf3d90a617fc80e74063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,85,9,35,178,22,96,83,160,33,207,61,144,166,23,252,128,231,64,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
