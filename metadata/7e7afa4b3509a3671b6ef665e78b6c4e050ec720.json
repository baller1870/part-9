Dream Brother\n\n\nGrace is a truly musical monument, spanning time and space and perpetually blowing fresh minds round the globe (and quite possibly somewhere beyond). His voice is multi-textured and he uses notes to dramatic effect - the agony and the ecstasy of it hitting you straight in the gut. His music is so extraordinary, in fact, that it's impossible to put this album on in the background without being drawn into its psyche. Don't just listen but experience, be mesmerized, take a trip. \nMiss you Jeff.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 11\nArtist: Jeff Buckley\nAlbum: Grace\nYear: 1994\nGenre: Alternative\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7afa4b3509a3671b6ef665e78b6c4e050ec720","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+-+Grace+%5BFLAC-1994%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e7afa4b3509a3671b6ef665e78b6c4e050ec720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,122,250,75,53,9,163,103,27,110,246,101,231,139,108,78,5,14,199,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
