Their worlds are often defined by obsession, greed, and revenge.\r\n\r\nDeadly Women fuses bone-chilling story-telling, sumptuous period drama and forensic fact in a bid to explore history's most alluring female killers. Each episode profiles four famous cases from the past; killers and their victims are brought to life by elaborate dramatized reconstructions. The program will span four centuries and seven countries to explore the makings of these deadly women.\r\n\r\nCandice DeLong, a former FBI agent and profiler, and Dr. Janis Amatuzio, a forensic pathologist will also join the program to give a deeper insight into the crimes and the women who commit them. \r\n\r\nEp 1 - Thrill Kills\r\nEp 2 - Fatal Attraction\r\nEp 3 - Twisted Minds\r\nEp 4 - Dark Secrets\r\nEp 5 - Bad Medicine\r\nEp 6 - Predators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb77555e51cf78756281f79098c5fcb2befa608","amp;dn":"+Deadly+Women+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb77555e51cf78756281f79098c5fcb2befa608","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,183,117,85,229,28,247,135,86,40,31,121,9,140,95,203,43,239,166,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
