Formed under the leadership of celebrated cartoonist Davide Toffolo, the band is rounded out by drummer and original member Luca Masseroni and bass player Enrico Molteni, who joined the group for its third single, &quot;Si Parte,&quot; which had been preceded by singles &quot;Mondo Naif&quot; (1994) and &quot;Allegro Pogo Morto&quot; (1995). In 1997 the band released its first full-length record, Piccolo Intervento a Vivo. The album peaked interest of A&amp;R at BMG Ricordi, which signed Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti and got on board for their 1999 release, Mostri e Normali. The band's relationship with the multinational label was short-lived, however, and Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti issued their 2000 EP, Il Principe en Bicicletta, on their own La Tempesta label. Released in 2001, Testa Indipendente featured one of the group's better-known singles, &quot;Ogni Adolescenza.&quot; The band's prolific recording career continued through 2003 with Swtiched on Tarm, followed by Il Sogno del Gorilla Bianco in 2004 and a live concert DVD in 2005. Tre Allegri Ragazzi Morti gained their first international performance experience as they headlined a tour to Argentina and Uruguay. The trio released its fifth original release in February of 2007, entitled La Seconda Rivoluzione Sessuale, issued by La Tempesta and distributed by Venus Records.\n\n.: Tre allegri ragazzi morti Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/8650/treallegriragazzimortitjj8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/8650/treallegriragazzimortitjj8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nPiccolo intervento a vivo - Anno: 1994\nMostri e normali - 1999\nIl principe in bicicletta - Anno: 2000\nLa testa indipendente - 2001\nLe origini - 2002\nIl sogno del gorilla bianco - 2004\nLive @ Patchanka Radio Popolare 26-03-04","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25221592567a695c744f6db40ddd635ac815df1","amp;dn":"Tre+allegri+ragazzi+morti+-+Discography+1994-2006+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25221592567a695c744f6db40ddd635ac815df1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,82,33,89,37,103,166,149,199,68,246,219,64,221,214,53,172,129,93,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
