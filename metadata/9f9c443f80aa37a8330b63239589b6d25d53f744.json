His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, where the giddy young man held his own among the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest minds. There, Feynman turned theory into practice, culminating in the Trinity test, on July 16, 1945, when the Atomic Age was born. He was only twenty-seven. And he was just getting started.\n \nIn this sweeping biography, James Gleick captures the forceful personality of a great man, integrating FeynmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work and life in a way that is accessible to laymen and fascinating for the scientists who follow in his footsteps.\n\nFollow me on twitter: @livhre\nRequest books on twitter: @livhre\nPlease seed and rate the torrents I upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9c443f80aa37a8330b63239589b6d25d53f744","amp;dn":"Genius%3A+The+Life+and+Science+of+Richard+Feynman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9c443f80aa37a8330b63239589b6d25d53f744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,156,68,63,128,170,55,168,51,11,99,35,149,137,182,210,93,83,247,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
