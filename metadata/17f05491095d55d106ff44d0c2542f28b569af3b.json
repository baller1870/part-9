McEuen\nArt Direction I William E. McEuen\nNationality I USA\n\nThis momentous album was conceived by NGDB manager, Bill McEuen, who wanted the country-rock band to be taken more seriously by their label. Without asking for a budget, he booked a Nashville studio and invited legendary local luminaries like Roy Acuff, Mother Maybelle Carter, Earl Scruggs, Merle Travis, and Doc Watson, as well as such revered pickers as Vassar Clements on violin and Norman Blake on dobro, to become part of this ambitious project.\n\nThe plan worked: this became the band's first gold album, although- curiously-on some tracks, such as &quot;The End Of The World,&quot; &quot;Cannonball Rag,&quot; &quot;Wabash Cannonball,&quot; and others, none of the group members are credited as participating! That said, for anyone interested in great country songs by the likes of Hank Williams, A.P. Carter, Scruggs, and Travis played in authentic bluegrass style, this album can hardly be bettered.\nThe relaxed atmosphere resulted in some superb performances, and consistently high quality.\n\nMoreover, the combined talents of the NGDB and their revered guests attracted sales from both old-time country aficionados, and younger country-rock fans. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is still active-four of the members who played on this album feature on their latest (2004) offering. The band has also released two subsequent sequels-Volume 2 in 1989 and Volume 3 in 2002, featuring many of the same luminaries.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\nCD1\n\n101 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Jimmy Martin - Grand Ole Opry Song.flac\n102 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Maybelle Carter - Keep On The Sunny Side.flac\n103 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Nashville Blues.flac\n104 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - You Are My Flower.flac\n105 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Roy Acuff - The Precious Jewel.flac\n106 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Merle Travis - Dark As A Dungeon.flac\n107 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Doc Watson - Tennessee Stud.flac\n108 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Black Mountain Rag.flac\n109 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Roy Acuff - Wreck On The Highway.flac\n110 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - The End Of The World.flac\n111 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Roy Acuff - I Saw The Light.flac\n112 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Sunny Side Of The Mountain.flac\n113 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Nine Pound Hammer.flac\n114 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Jimmy Martin - Losin' You (Might Be The Best Thing Yet).flac\n115 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Honky Tonkin'.flac\n116 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Jimmy Martin - You Don't Know My Mind.flac\n117 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Jimmy Martin - My Walkin' Shoes.flac\n\n\nCD2\n\n201 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Lonesome Fiddle Blues.flac\n202 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Merle Travis - Cannonball Rag.flac\n203 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Avalanche.flac\n204 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Flint Hill Special.flac\n205 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Togary Mountain.flac\n206 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Earl's Breakdown.flac\n207 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Vassar Clements - Orange Blossom Special.flac\n208 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Wabash Cannonball.flac\n209 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Lost Highway.flac\n210 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Doc Watson &amp; Merle Travis First Meeting (Dialogue).flac\n211 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Doc Watson - Way Downtown.flac\n212 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Doc Watson - Down Yonder.flac\n213 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Roy Acuff - Pins And Needles (In My Heart).flac\n214 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Honky Tonk Blues.flac\n215 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Bashful Brother Oswald - Sailin' On To Hawaii.flac\n216 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - I'm Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes.flac\n217 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - I Am A Pilgrim.flac\n218 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Maybelle Carter - Wildwood Flower.flac\n219 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Soldier's Joy.flac\n220 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Will The Circle Be Unbroken.flac\n221 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band &amp; Randy Scruggs - Both Sides Now.flac\n222 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Foggy Mountain Breakdown.flac\n223 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Warming Up For 'the Opry' (Dialogue).flac\n224 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Sunny Side.flac\n225 - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Remember Me.flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f05491095d55d106ff44d0c2542f28b569af3b","amp;dn":"Nitty+Gritty+Dirt+Band+-+Will+The+Circle+Be+Unbroken+%5B1972%5D+%28200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f05491095d55d106ff44d0c2542f28b569af3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,240,84,145,9,93,85,209,6,255,68,208,194,84,47,40,181,105,175,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
