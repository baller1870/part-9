Here we have four very cool records that were never released on CD and remained criminally obscure and underrated. For instance check out the Private Sector's LP, it contains the best song that New Order never wrote.....If you don't know them, you'll love them. Or we have New Johnny Five's LP (interestingly they were 6 people in the band), a hell of a post punk/new wave music. The Agents were also a Bristol power pop Mod band that very quite talented but unlucky. If memorey serves me right they moved to Germany to release their music. Someone had requested Mondo Vita's record ages ago, sorry dude but here you go. \n\nMondo Vita - Fins De Paris [1983]\n\nNew Johnny 5 - ..Alternative Tactics [1986]\n\nPrivate Sector - The Darkness Burning Bright [1987]\n\nThe Agents - Everybody's Gonna Be Happy (1982)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b546e2d645a9477743bdc362bdf18694191913","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+131%5D+New+Wave%2C+Power+Pop%2C+Indie+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b546e2d645a9477743bdc362bdf18694191913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,181,70,226,214,69,169,71,119,67,189,195,98,189,241,134,148,25,25,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
