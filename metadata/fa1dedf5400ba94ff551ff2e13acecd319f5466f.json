Dominated by Colin Blunstone's breathy vocals, choral backup harmonies, and Rod Argent's shining jazz- and classical-influenced organ and piano, the band sounded utterly unique for their era. Indeed, their material -- penned by either Argent or guitarist Chris White, with unexpected shifts from major to minor keys -- was perhaps too adventurous for the singles market. To this day, they're known primarily for their three big hit singles, &quot;She's Not There&quot; (1964), &quot;Tell Her No&quot; (1965), and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; (1969). Most listeners remain unaware that the group maintained a remarkably high quality of work for several years.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-p5908/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Al Campbell):\n\nThe Zombies EP Collection, from the See for Miles label, contains the British Invasion bands biggest hits from 1964 through 1966, including &quot;Tell Her No,&quot; &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; and, in both mono and stereo, &quot;She's Not There.&quot; While this collection does an effective job chronicling the hits, Big Beat's 2000 release The Singles Collection: A's &amp; B's, 1964-1969 is superior as it goes further into their catalog and contains &quot;Care of Cell 44,&quot; &quot;Beechwood Park,&quot; &quot;Friends of Mine,&quot; and &quot;Maybe After He's Gone&quot; taken from their 1968 masterpiece Odessey and Oracle.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r550682&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ep-collection-r550682&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000767N&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000767N&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
