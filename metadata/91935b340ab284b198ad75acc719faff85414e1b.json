Champions Manchester City begin the defence of their title away at Newcastle. City beat the Magpies at home and away last season, and also got the better of them in the League Cup, so will be expecting to get the 2014-15 campaign off to a winning start. Liverpool, who just missed out on the title last season, begin life without talismanic but controversial striker Luis Suarez, hosting Southampton at Anfield.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91935b340ab284b198ad75acc719faff85414e1b","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-+17th+August+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91935b340ab284b198ad75acc719faff85414e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,147,91,52,10,178,132,177,152,173,117,172,199,25,250,255,133,65,78,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
