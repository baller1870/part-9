Episodes include Power and the People, deals with the governance of China, The Women, talks about the past and future for Chinese women, Shifting Nature, looks at China's environmental challenges, and Freedom, explores China's conflict between personal freedom and governance.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Shifting Nature \nChina is trying to feed 20 percent of the world's population on 7 percent of the world's arable land. A third of the world uses water from China's rivers. But rapid industrialization and climate change have led to bad air, polluted rivers and drought. Environmental activists, Party officials, academics and scientists are in a daily struggle over the damage to nature in China. Environmental campaigner Huo Daishan has been trying to save the heavily polluted Huai River, which provides water for 150 million people. Research took him to its main tributary, the Shaying, into which over a million tons of raw human sewage and untreated waste water are dumped daily. Rather than clamping down on polluters, local government protects local industries Other stories explore northern China's dire water shortage, which is being remedied by channelling water from the south in what will be the biggest hydraulic project in world history. A project in the arid Ningxia region has benefited nearly half a million people, but elsewhere relocation from dam areas, like the Three Gorges, is causing huge social upheaval.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img248/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img248/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img546/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img715/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img696/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img696/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img252/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img252/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img600/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img689/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img689/2857/chinafromtheinsidescree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1763 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 56.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce9715c08c73486742f331f1eb1e63104adfeeb","amp;dn":"PBS+China+from+the+Inside+3of4+Shifting+Nature+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce9715c08c73486742f331f1eb1e63104adfeeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,233,113,92,8,199,52,134,116,47,51,31,30,177,230,49,4,173,254,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
