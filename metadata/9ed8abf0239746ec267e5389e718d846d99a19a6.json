Head First Python is a complete learning experience for Python that helps you learn the language through a unique method that goes beyond syntax and how-to manuals, helping you understand how to be a great Python programmer. You'll quickly learn the language's fundamentals, then move onto persistence, exception handling, web development, SQLite, data wrangling, and Google App Engine. You'll also learn how to write mobile apps for Android, all thanks to the power that Python gives you.\n\nWe think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First Python uses a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed8abf0239746ec267e5389e718d846d99a19a6","amp;dn":"head+first+python+-+ora+2011.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed8abf0239746ec267e5389e718d846d99a19a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,216,171,240,35,151,70,236,38,126,83,137,231,24,216,70,217,154,25,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
