Bugs fixed:\n\n     a) when processing nested archives, WinRAR could attempt to open\n        inner archive as self-extracting instead of opening an outer\n        archive. It happened if inner archive was stored without\n        compression and outer archive name had non-standard extension;\n  \n     b) Unix RAR could not decompress hard links stored by WinRAR\n        if link source name included path separator characters.\n\n\nInstallation Notes:\n1. Install and Close WinRAR.\n(If You are installing over my Previous release, You Are Done !  No registration is Needed !!!)\n2. Use the keygen to make a valid keyfile for your name and move it to the WinRAR Installaion Folder. (Run as Administrator on Win 7 or Vista) \nOr use one of the 21 Included Keys.\n3. Have fun :wink:\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you appreciate this, please leave a comment to let others know how it worked for you !!!!!\n\nSupplied for Testing Only. \nIf You Like This Software, BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46799f0c40722296d0391005255c5518da69172","amp;dn":"WinRAR.5.10.Beta.2.32bit.64bit.FFF.+%5BTRiGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46799f0c40722296d0391005255c5518da69172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,103,153,240,196,7,34,41,109,3,145,0,82,85,197,81,141,166,145,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
