The album was released in conjunction with the band's Somewhere Back In Time World Tour to allow new fans to listen to a selection of the band's material that was played on the tour. The cover artwork by Derek Riggs features the Pharaoh Eddie monument from Powerslave and Cyborg Eddie from Somewhere in Time.\n\nA number of tracks were taken from the band's 1985 live album, Live After Death because the band preferred to use recordings which featured current Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson rather than Paul Di'Anno, who sang on their first two studio releases.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Churchill's Speech&quot;   \t  \t0.49\n02. \t&quot;Aces High&quot; (live) \t4.36\n03. \t&quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;   \t6.00\n04. \t&quot;The Trooper&quot;   \t4.11\n05. \t&quot;Wasted Years&quot;   \t5.06\n06. \t&quot;Children of the Damned&quot;   \t \t4.35\n07. \t&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;   \t\t4.53\n08. \t&quot;Run to the Hills&quot;   \t\t3.53\n09. \t&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (live) 7.21\n10. \t&quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;   4.34\n11. \t&quot;Wrathchild&quot; (live) \t3.07\n12. \t&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;   \tSm3.31\n13. \t&quot;Powerslave&quot;   \t\t6.47\n14. \t&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;   \t \t7.12\n15. \t&quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (live) \t4.50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb72bd92e8c6d4293934ca27baf6e93a141f2db","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Somewhere+Back+In+Time+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb72bd92e8c6d4293934ca27baf6e93a141f2db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,183,43,217,46,140,109,66,147,147,76,162,123,175,110,147,161,65,242,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
