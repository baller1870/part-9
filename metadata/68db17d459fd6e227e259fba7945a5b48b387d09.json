A photographer has a limited amount of time to find what it is about that child that will make a great photo. Some kids are shy and some are outgoing. The trick is to take what they offer and be ready for the unexpected. Photographer Jack Reznicki goes through a series of portrait sessions with children, ranging in age from infant to toddler, to preteen. Jacks rules for children are simple: The first rule is to have fun. The second rule is to be flexible. The third rule is to throw out all the rules.
