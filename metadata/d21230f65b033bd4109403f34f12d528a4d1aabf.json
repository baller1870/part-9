It combines the design and problem solving skills of engineering with the medical and biological science to help improve patient health care and the quality of life of healthy individuals.\n\nAs a relatively new discipline, much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development, covering an array of fields: bioinformatics, medical imaging, image processing, physiological signal processing, biomechanics, biomaterials and bioengineering, systems analysis, 3D modeling, etc. Examples of concrete applications of biomedical engineering are the development and manufacture of biocompatible prostheses, medical devices, diagnostic devices and imaging equipments and pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAcademic Press - Handbook Medical Imaging Processing Analysis.pdf\nAdvanced Probability Theory for Biomedical Engineers - John D.
