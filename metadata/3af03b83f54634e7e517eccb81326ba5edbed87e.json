In the past few years Heyoka has been taking elements of Glitch Hop, Grime, Drum &amp; Bass, Dubstep, and now Blues and Jazz and turned them on their heads repeatedly and emerging at times like the audio version of synthesized dimethyltryptamine and other times creating walls of sound that provide a full body massage and relieve pressure on the extremities.\n          One undeniably consistent element that is heard from anywhere he has toured or been submitted for review, is that the Heyoka experience is a bass lovers delight.\nMandelbass is named in respect to mathematician and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“creatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of fractals Benoit B. Mandelbrot and also delves deeply into blues and 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s garage influences, all the while maintaining HeyokaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dynamic use of Glitch plugins and edits. So get ready for a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“glitched out session of low down bass grooves and some honky tonk thrown in for good measure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3af03b83f54634e7e517eccb81326ba5edbed87e","amp;dn":"Heyoka+-+Mandelbass","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3af03b83f54634e7e517eccb81326ba5edbed87e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,240,59,131,245,70,52,231,229,23,236,203,129,50,107,165,237,190,216,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
