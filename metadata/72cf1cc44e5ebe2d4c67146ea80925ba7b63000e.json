Reno 911! features members of a fictitious Reno Sheriff&amp;#039;s Department, videotaped in the course of their duties, sometimes addressing the camera directly as though being interviewed. The show deals heavily in non-politically-correct and &amp;#039;racy&amp;#039; humor, including many jokes about race, sexual orientation, drug &amp; alcohol abuse, rape, and so on. It has been nominated for and received various awards. Only the basic plot elements of the show are scripted, with the dialog improvised, enhancing the illusion of reality (a practice referred to as retroscripting). Unlike COPS, which the show parodies, Reno 911! Sheriff&amp;#039;s deputies are constantly cursing, causing much of their dialog to be &quot;bleeped&quot; for broadcast. The actors often perform their own stunts. A constantly-changing cast of weirdos, prostitutes, homeless persons, survivalists, etc. are portrayed by comedian friends of the primary cast.\nWIKI Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_911\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370194/\n\nSeason 1...\n\nS01E01 - Pilot\nS01E02 - Fireworks\nS01E03 - Execution Tickets\nS01E04 - Clementine&amp;#039;s Pregnant\nS01E05 - Jones Gets Suspended\nS01E06 - Help From the FBI\nS01E07 - Wiegel Suicide Watch\nS01E08 - Clementine Gets Married\nS01E09 - Garcia&amp;#039;s Anniversary\nS01E10 - Burning Man Festival\nS01E11 - Dangle&amp;#039;s Moving Day\nS01E12 - Terrorist Training (Part 1)\nS01E13 - Terrorist Training (Part 2)\nS01E14 - Halloween\n\nSeason 2...\n\nS02E01 - Dangle&amp;#039;s Promotion\nS02E02 - Wegiel&amp;#039;s New Boyfriend\nS02E03 - British Law\nS02E04 - Dangle&amp;#039;s Ex Visits\nS02E05 - Religion in Reno\nS02E06 - Firefighters Are Jerks\nS02E07 - Not Without My Mustache\nS02E08 - Security for Kenny Rogers\nS02E09 - More FBI Help\nS02E10 - Raineesha X\nS02E11 - Clementine and Garcia Are Dating\nS02E12 - Undercover Drug Bust\nS02E13 - President Bush in Reno\nS02E14 - Accidental Marriage (Part 1)\nS02E15 - Accidental Marriage (Part 2)\nS02E16 - Investigation Concluded (Part 3)\n\nSeason 3...\n\nS03E01 - Reno S.D.

Since then, I took the episodes, fixed them with YAAI (&amp;#039;Yet Another AVI Info&amp;#039;), and now they&amp;#039;re perfectly synced. That was a good ten or eleven hours well-spent. Also, enjoy the extensive extras, and a bunch of stuff that you wouldn&amp;#039;t find on an official DVD release, like interviews with the creators and actors during the writers&amp;#039; strike. Of course the capitalist class doesn&amp;#039;t want you to see the people you watch and love unionizing and toppling corporate power -- that would give you ideas. By means of the strike, they gave the themselves, the laborers, a greater share of the wealth that they are personally responsible for creating. If they can do it, you can do it, I can do it, we can all do it. The profit of an entrepreneur, no matter how much, is still a theft of the working class. The capitalists are awarded their extravagant and limitless wealth for being idle, while the untold millions are in poverty for laboring in harsh and difficult conditions. That&amp;#039;s why I definitely included the strike interviews here. Now look at your social situation, analyze and think about it, and then act. Strike! Strike! Strike! And enjoy your free videos!]\n\nThis torrent is a part of Operation: Massive Information Leak, Wave Two.\nBloodLogic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cf1cc44e5ebe2d4c67146ea80925ba7b63000e","amp;dn":"Reno+911%21+-+Seasons+1-5+%2B+Extras+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cf1cc44e5ebe2d4c67146ea80925ba7b63000e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,207,28,196,78,94,190,45,76,103,20,110,168,9,37,186,123,99,0,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
