Pagliaro was nominated for a 1975 Juno Award as male vocalist of the year. He is often referred to as simply Pagliaro or Pag. Although he writes and records predominantly in French, Pagliaro has released material in English\n\n Pagliaro's first nationally English-charted hit was his 1970 single &quot;Give Us One More Chance&quot;. Other significant hits in English include &quot;Lovin' You Ain't Easy&quot; (1971), &quot;Rainshowers&quot; (1972), &quot;Some Sing Some Dance&quot; (1972), and &quot;What The Hell I Got&quot; (1975). Pagliaro was the first Canadian artist to score top 40 hits on both the anglophone and francophone pop charts in Canada.\n\n At the Juno Awards of 1975, Pagliaro was nominated for the Male Vocalist of the Year award. Pagliaro received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, in 2008. His song &quot;J'entends frapper&quot;, a major hit in Quebec, was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b64db76d6dc6e1dfe0a917fde63305a14a07fa","amp;dn":"Michel+Pagliaro+-+Hit+Parade+%5B2+CD%27s%5D%5B2010%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b64db76d6dc6e1dfe0a917fde63305a14a07fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,182,77,183,109,109,198,225,223,224,169,23,253,230,51,5,161,74,7,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
