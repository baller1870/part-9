Winfield, a dirt-poor singer who makes it to the top of hillbilly music only to be destroyed by a drug addiction; and Toussaint Boudreaux, a black longshoreman who is set up for a crime he did not commit. What brings them together, and how they must struggle to escape the bondage that links them makes for a tale of atmosphere and suspense that is vintage Burke. \nBurke's debut novel was published when the now-bestselling author was in his twenties, and yet contains all the rich storytelling elements readers have come to expect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa5cc1127cc84c3ded2f730f8d6abcbbb6f3e4e","amp;dn":"Half+of+Paradise+by+James+Lee+Burke+%28Retail+-+Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa5cc1127cc84c3ded2f730f8d6abcbbb6f3e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,165,204,17,39,204,132,195,222,210,247,48,248,214,171,203,187,111,62,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
