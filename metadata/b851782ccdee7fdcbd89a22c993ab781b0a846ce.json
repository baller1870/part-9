What if happiness was found in the unlikeliest of places? When do we allow ourselves to embrace the new without fear of letting go of the past? Gil (EmÃƒÂ­lio Dantas) is a twenty year old young man that questions himself and the world. He is an orphan, raised by his aunt Leila (Paloma Duarte) and his uncle CÃƒÂ©sar (Roberto Bomtempo). His lifestyle is fulfilled by his guitar, poetry and alcohol, generating a family war that causes Gil to run away from home causing him to leave behind all his belongings, security and the only love that he had till then, the love of his aunt Leila. With his guitar on his back, without a destiny, money or the support of friends, Gil meets OtÃƒÂ¡vio (Remo Rocha), a music producer that will change his destiny forever. Written by Caio SÃƒÂ³h \n\n\n\nOnly &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; surpasses the soul-touching perfection that &quot;Teus Olhos Meus/Soulbound&quot; brings to the screen. The performers inhabit their roles perfectly and fill this love-story with genuine emotion and earnest, human struggle. In this film, every element converges successfully to take the viewer on an impossibly subtle ride through an authentic landscape fraught with the highs and lows of human relationships. The entire ride unfolds smoothly and organically with no false-steps to break the spell cast by these enchanters. In truth, I completely forgot that I was on a fantastic roller-coaster until the ride ended, and I was facing the wonderful, reeling, and real emotional after effects of great movie-making, just like &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. I will never forget this movie.
