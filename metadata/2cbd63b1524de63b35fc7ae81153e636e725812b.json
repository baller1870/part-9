It analyses todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s challenges in the aviation and hospitality industry, in destination management, and in marketing and distribution management.\n\nNew empirical data on general travel behaviour and the latest consumer trends are also presented. The contributors to this book are well-known individuals from important tourism, travel and consulting firms (e.g. BCD Travel, Oger Tours, Booz and Company, GfK, IPK International) and researchers from universities in Switzerland, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany.\n\nIn addition institutes specializing in future research highlight important travel trends.
