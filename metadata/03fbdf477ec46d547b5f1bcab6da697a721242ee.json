Siegel, &quot;Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation&quot;\nEnglish | 2010-12-28 | ISBN: 0553386395 | 336 pages | EPUB \n\nThis groundbreaking book, from one of the global innovators in the integration of brain science with psychotherapy, offers an extraordinary guide to the practice of Ã¢â‚¬Å“mindsight,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the potent skill that is the basis for both emotional and social intelligence. From anxiety to depression and feelings of shame and inadequacy, from mood swings to addictions, OCD, and traumatic memories, most of us have a mental Ã¢â‚¬Å“trapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that causes recurring conflict in our lives and relationships. Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and co-director of the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center, shows us how to use mindsight to escape these traps. Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients free themselves from obstacles blocking their happiness. By cultivating mindsight, all of us can effect positive, lasting changes in our brainsÃ¢â‚¬â€and our lives. A book as inspiring as it is profound, Mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03fbdf477ec46d547b5f1bcab6da697a721242ee","amp;dn":"Mindsight%3A+The+New+Science+of+Personal+Transformation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03fbdf477ec46d547b5f1bcab6da697a721242ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,251,223,71,126,196,109,84,123,95,27,202,182,218,105,122,114,18,66,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
