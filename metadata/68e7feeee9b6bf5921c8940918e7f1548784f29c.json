It features the cast members from the movie blockbuster Terminator 2; Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick and Linda Hamilton. But that&amp;#039;s not all. It&amp;#039;s a 3D show with live actors and some environmental special effects. Too bad these two things couldn&amp;#039;t be included on the DVD ;-)\n\nThe show has never been released on DVD. Logical ofcourse, but people who do not have the possibility to go to one of these themeparks, are missing this little adventure. Now, they at least get a good glimpse at it. Plus more!!!\n\n\nThe content:\n\nDISC I - Main Feature\nLIVE SHOW - The complete live experience (interactive).\nWORKPRINTS - Test versions of the show.\nQUEUE AREA - The promotional Cyberdyne video by themepark.\n3D VILLAIN - Meet Terminator 2 3D&amp;#039;s villain in the third dimension.\nINFO / FACTS - Everything you thought you&amp;#039;d know... and much more!\n\nDISC II - Bonus Features\nBACKSTAGE - Go behind-the-scenes of Terminator 2 3D.\nELECTRONIC PRESS KIT - Exclusive promotional footage.\nPROMOTIONAL SPOTS - Trailers, commercials, and more.\nCYBERDYNE SHOWCASE - The future of technology... Today!\nIMAGES - Conceptual artwork, posters, and more.\n\nJust compare it to the official Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition. Only this set is fanmade and focussed on Terminator 2 3D.\n\n\nTechnical info:\n2 DVD set (disc 1: 3,93 gb, disc 2: 3,30 gb).\nNTSC 720 x 480 video, Dobly Digital (AC3) audio. Region free.\nCover artwork is included in the DVD_ROM folder on both the discs.\n\n\nKeywords:\n- Terminator\n- 3D\n- Universal Studios\n- Fanedit\n- Preservation\n- Special Edition\n- Workprint\n- Live\n\nImportant note:\nIn the beginning, seeding will be done by me alone. So it can go slowly in the beginning. Please have some understanding for this and don&amp;#039;t go complaining about it. Hopefully in the future, more people will seed this. Also, be fair and at least seed this to a 1:1 ratio, so other people get the chance to see it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e7feeee9b6bf5921c8940918e7f1548784f29c","amp;dn":"Terminator+2+3D%3A+Battle+Across+Time+T-HOPE+Ultimate+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e7feeee9b6bf5921c8940918e7f1548784f29c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,231,254,238,233,182,191,89,33,200,148,9,24,231,241,84,135,132,242,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
