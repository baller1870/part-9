He sings all of the arias, but he died before finishing the recitatives, which are here taken by Werner Krenn. The recording is, in addition, one of Herbert Von Karajan's finest, vastly better than his later digital remake. His interpretation is straightforward and impressively large in scale, but never pompous or sanctimonious (which was Karajan's big problem in music of a religious character). The truth is, Haydn's consistently fresh and unpretentious invention acts as a positive anesthetic against bombast, and the composer himself once said that thinking of the Creator always made him irresistibly cheerful. With The Creation, Haydn returned the favour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b545f9f9d0007030c5bdd74d2aa3a9d2e18bd1","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+The+Creation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b545f9f9d0007030c5bdd74d2aa3a9d2e18bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,181,69,249,249,208,0,112,48,197,189,215,77,42,163,169,210,225,139,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
