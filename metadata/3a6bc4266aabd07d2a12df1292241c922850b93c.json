Pete Sandidge is a very able pilot who seems to have a streak of luck as far as flying goes. World War II is raging and Pete has come out of it pretty so far. He even has a beautiful girlfriend Dorinda Durston, herself a qualified pilot who ferries aircraft to different bases. When Pete is killed however, he finds himself in heaven and learns that every pilot has a guardian angel. He returns to Earth where, unseen by anyone, he coaches a pilot-in-training Ted Randall. Ted is a pretty good kid and is coming along nicely but when he's shipped to New Guinea he runs into Dorinda who has remained faithful to her lost love. As Ted pursues her, Pete will have to decide what he wants to do about it.              \n\nACTORS: \nSpencer Tracy, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Ward Bond, James Gleason, Lionel Barrymore, \n\nRELEASED: \n March 1944 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035959/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035959/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 1964021616 bytes (1.83 GiB), duration: 01:59:56, avg.bitrate: 2183 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 720x480, 23.98 fps(r) =&gt; 640x480 (eng)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=72722516487531484735.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=72722516487531484735.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=33862008427265475473.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=33862008427265475473.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=56613375462175436630.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=56613375462175436630.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : HANDJOB\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a6bc4266aabd07d2a12df1292241c922850b93c","amp;dn":"A+Guy+Named+Joe+1943+DVDRip+x264-HANDJOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a6bc4266aabd07d2a12df1292241c922850b93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,107,196,38,106,171,208,125,42,18,223,18,146,36,28,146,40,80,185,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
