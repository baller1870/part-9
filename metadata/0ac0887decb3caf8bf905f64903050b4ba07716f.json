Jim Norton takes over to bitch about the traffic on Long Island, we go to Ant (barely) live from his bed, Jim talks about wanting to move, and they chat about Stuttering John as well as condom issues. They also talk about some newer guests on Opie and Jimmy, the new studio, we see the trailer for Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂºBlack Mass,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹ Ant explains the app and studio space for the assholes on Reddit, Jimmy talks about trying not to be such a sexual deviant, his current diet, and his newest special. The guys then discuss Amy Schumer, people being offended by jokes, Colin Quinn, they reminisce about old stores, Kendra Sunderland, Ant brings his hacking cough down to the poker table where he and Jim talk about Chip, reading on the toilet, take a few calls, and then Don the Hypnotist, Bobo and Edgar join the show. Bobo briefly talks about the Rangers game, Don hypnotizes Bobo into BooBoo, makes him British, an astronaut, and makes him stick to his chair while he talks about the tail waiting for him upstairs. Don tells us about his business, Bobo wakes up to talk about his experience, we hear about JimmyÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s upcoming show dates, and find out which ones Ant will be attending.\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac0887decb3caf8bf905f64903050b4ba07716f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-05-14+Jim+Norton%2C+Bobo%2C+Don+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac0887decb3caf8bf905f64903050b4ba07716f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,192,136,125,236,179,202,248,191,144,95,100,144,48,80,180,186,7,113,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
