The strategies used to produce these are increasingly based on our knowledge of relevant science, particularly genetics, but involves a multidisciplinary understanding that optimizes the approaches taken.\n\nPrinciples of Plant Genetics and Breeding, 2nd Edition introduces both classical and molecular tools for plant breeding. Topics such as biotechnology in plant breeding, intellectual property, risks, emerging concepts (decentralized breeding, organic breeding), and more are addressed in the new, updated edition of this text. Industry highlight boxes are included throughout the text to contextualize the information given through the professional experiences of plant breeders. The final chapters provide a useful reference on breeding the largest and most common crops.\n-    Up-to-date edition of this bestselling book incorporating the most recent technologies in the field\n-    Combines both theory and practice in modern plant breeding\n-    Updated industry highlights help to illustrate the concepts outlined in the text\n-    Self assessment questions at the end of each chapter aid student learning\n-    Accompanying website with artwork from the book available to instructors \n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.asu-hbcu.org/2012/img/bios/dr_george_acquaah.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.asu-hbcu.org/2012/img/bios/dr_george_acquaah.png&lt;/a&gt;\nDr. George Acquaah is the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Bowie State University. He received his Bachelor of Science- Agricultural Science with honors and Master of Science-Crop Science degrees from the University of Ghana, Legon in 1975 and 1979, respectively. Dr. AcquaahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research interests are in tissue culture applications and plant genomics to improve tropical species. He authored several journal articles and seven (7) college textbooks, one of which (Understanding Biotechnology) has been translated into Chinese, while another  (Plant Genetics and Breeding) was translated into Farsi and was judged Ã¢â‚¬Å“world classÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ among the 13 books reviewed by an international faculty panel at a European university.  Dr. Acquaah is a member of the American Society for the Advancement of Science.\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nPreface, ix\nAcknowledgements, xi\nIndustry highlights boxes, xiii\nIndustry highlights boxes: authors, xv\nSection 1 Overview and historical perspectives, 1\nSection 2 Population and quantitative genetic principles, 41\nSection 3 Reproductive systems, 95\nSection 4 Germplasm for breeding, 171\nSection 5 Breeding objectives, 227\nSection 6 Selection methods, 301\nSection 7 Molecular breeding, 383\nSection 8 Marketing and societal issues in breeding, 489\nSection 9 Breeding selected crops, 575\nSupplementary chapters: review of genetic statistical principles, 689\n1 Plant cellular organization and genetic structure: an overview, 691\n2 Common statistical methods in plant breeding, 707\nGlossary of terms, 726\nAppendix 1: Conversion rates, 731\nIndex, 732","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056e8d7443abafc099d66ce5a3dceb512e2f2776","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Plant+Genetics+and+Breeding+%282nd+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056e8d7443abafc099d66ce5a3dceb512e2f2776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,110,141,116,67,171,175,192,153,214,108,229,163,220,235,81,46,47,39,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
