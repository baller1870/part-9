More comprehensive than ever before, it indicates key recordings on CD, DVD, and enhanced SACD, including those in surround sound.  If you want the finest available version of any major classical album, you will find it listed and assessed in these pages.\n\nIn THE ESSENTIAL CLASSICAL RECORDINGS (2004), CBC Radio's Rick Phillips reviews what he considers to be the 101 essential CDs, and tells readers not only why each one is the best recording in his opinion, but also why this piece of music belongs in their collection and where the composer fits into the evolution of classical music.  Read consecutively, the recommendations -- from medieval Gregorian chant to Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt's &quot;Fratres&quot; (1977) -- form a dazzling and concise history of classical music. \n\nBoth books are in EPUB format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc555fe9784c0f3fe85d16f81ee033b4266f9267","amp;dn":"Guides+to+the+Finest+Classical+Music+Recordings+%282+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc555fe9784c0f3fe85d16f81ee033b4266f9267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,85,95,233,120,76,15,63,232,93,22,248,30,224,51,180,38,111,146,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
