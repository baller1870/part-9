As we did with S-Spline, our S-Spline XL technology again introduces a revolutionary breakthrough in digital image enlargement. It is able to render sharp and crisp clear image magnifications perfectly focused, yet without the jagged edges, loss of detail, or lack of photorealism that normally come with enlarging images. \n\nMany professionals are familiar with the problem; quality loss caused by digital image magnification. In many cases a great deal of time is spent on achieving only a fairly acceptable enlargement result, however there are familiar side effects including out-of-focus images and serrated edges which is illustrative for the lack of professional magnification software. \n\nThe software is perfectly suited for digital photography, large printing, DTP, web design and online publishing, but also for industrial image processing such as space technology, security, medical, and forensic applications.\n\nWHAT'S NEW in Version 3.0:\n\n* New &amp; improved S-Spline interpolation technique: S-Spline Max\n\n* Higher quality image enlargements &amp; higher quality downsizing\n\n* Makes short work of interpolation artifacts, such as halos\n\n* Film Grain functionality for an increased natural look\n\n* Multi-processor support: huge speed increase!\n\n* Now works as a stand-alone application and as an Automation plug-in and Export plug-in for Photoshop\n\n* Increased image support (metadata, ICC profiles, color spaces, layers, 16 bits/channel (including Raw) and 32 bits/channel (HDR) images, etc)\n\n* Can also be applied as a Photoshop Action\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nMac OS X 10.3 or later.\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55a94d406101793f4de17ca0e349ed88da26d843","amp;dn":"PhotoZoom+Pro+V3.0+%5BK%5Drack%5C%27d+%2B+unlock+key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55a94d406101793f4de17ca0e349ed88da26d843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,169,77,64,97,1,121,63,77,225,124,160,227,73,237,136,218,38,216,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
