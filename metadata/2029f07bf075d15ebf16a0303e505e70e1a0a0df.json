Four men once close to Jack Dodds, a London butcher, meet to carry out his peculiar last wish: to have his ashes scattered into the sea. For reasons best known to herself, Jack's widow, Amy, declines to join them. On the surface the tale of a simple if increasingly bizarre day's outing, Last Order is Graham Swift's most poignant exploration of the complexity and courage of ordinary lives.\n\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n              Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2029f07bf075d15ebf16a0303e505e70e1a0a0df","amp;dn":"Last+Orders+by+Graham+Swift+%281996+Man+Booker+Prize+Winner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2029f07bf075d15ebf16a0303e505e70e1a0a0df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,41,240,123,240,117,209,94,191,22,160,48,62,80,94,112,225,160,160,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
