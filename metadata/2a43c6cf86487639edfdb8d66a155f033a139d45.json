As well, Gomez toured the UK with Embrace. Their first single &quot;78 Stone Wobble&quot; was released in March 1998 with their debut album Bring It On coming out a month later. The album received a good critical response from both sides of the Atlantic with Spin calling it a &quot;damn beautiful album&quot;. Sales in the UK really took off when it won the 1998 Mercury Music Prize for best album beating the favourites Massive Attack's Mezzanine and The Verve's Urban Hymns. &quot;Get Myself Arrested&quot; and &quot;Whippin' Piccadilly&quot; were later released as singles. While Gomez toured the US as the support artist for Eagle Eye Cherry, Bring It On is the only Gomez album so far not to make the US charts although the album did make the Australian album charts. &quot;Bring It On&quot; is also the name of a song on Gomez's following album, Liquid Skin.\n\n&quot;Get Miles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n&quot;Whippin' Piccadilly&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12 \n&quot;Make No Sound&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26 \n&quot;78 Stone Wobble&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22 \n&quot;Tijuana Lady&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08 \n&quot;Here Comes the Breeze&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29 \n&quot;Love Is Better Than a Warm Trombone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29 \n&quot;Get Myself Arrested&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n&quot;Free to Run&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31 \n&quot;Bubble Gum Years&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \n&quot;Rie's Wagon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:07 \n\nAll tracks written and performed by Ball/Blackburn/Gray/Ottewell/Peacock.\n\nAdditional musicians:\n\nMat Quinton - Tuba on &quot;Get Miles&quot; \nIan Bracken - Cello on &quot;Make No Sound&quot; \nSusie Wright - Saxophone on &quot;78 Stone Wobble&quot; \nSteve Fellows - Fuzz Guitar on &quot;Love Is Better Than A Warm Trombone\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a43c6cf86487639edfdb8d66a155f033a139d45","amp;dn":"Gomez...Bring+It+On%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D---D+ICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a43c6cf86487639edfdb8d66a155f033a139d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,67,198,207,134,72,118,57,237,253,184,214,106,21,95,3,58,19,157,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
