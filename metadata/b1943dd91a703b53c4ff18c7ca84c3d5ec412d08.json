This encyclopedic text not only encompasses nearly all facets of microwave engineering, but also gives all topicsÃ¢â‚¬â€including microwave generation, measurement, and processingÃ¢â‚¬â€equal emphasis. Packed with illustrations to aid in comprehension, the book:\n\n-  Describes the mathematical theory of waveguides and ferrite devices, devoting an entire chapter to the Smith chart and its applications\n-  Discusses different types of microwave components, antennas, tubes, transistors, diodes, and parametric devices\n-  Examines various attributes of cavity resonators, semiconductor and RF/microwave devices, and microwave integrated circuits\n-  Addresses scattering parameters and their properties, as well as planar structures including striplines and microstrips\n-  Considers the limitations of conventional tubes, behavior of charged particles in different fields, and the concept of velocity modulation\n\nBased on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own class notes, Microwave Engineering: Concepts and Fundamentals consists of 16 chapters featuring homework problems, references, and numerical examples. PowerPointÃ‚Â® slides and MATLABÃ‚Â®-based solutions are available with qualifying course adoption.\n\nAbout the Author\nAhmad Shahid Khan holds a BSc, MSc, and Ph.D from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), India. Possessing over 40 years of teaching experience, the former AMU University Medal recipient, professor, and chairman of the AMU Department of Electronics Engineering is an IETE India fellow, IEI member, and SSI and ISTE life member. A popular invited lecturer, he has published 23 journal and conference papers, co-authored the book Antennas and Wave Propagation (Special Indian Edition), edited the book A Guide to the Laboratory Practice in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and received the Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Memorial Gold Medal from JIE India.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface..xxvii\nAuthor... xxix\n1 Introduction..1\n2 Fundamentals of Wave Propagation.. 17\n3 Waveguides ..87\n4 Cavity Resonators.. 139\n5 Microwave Ferrite Devices ..163\n6 Smith Chart ..185\n7 Microwave Components..231\n8 Scattering Parameters ..279\n9 Microwave Antennas ..317\n10 Microwave Measurements ..343\n11 Basics of Microwave Tubes ..381\n12 Microwave Tubes ..411\n13 Microwave Diodes ..503\n14 Microwave Transistors ..579\n15 Planar Transmission Lines ..659\n16 Microwave Integrated Circuits ..701\nAppendix A1: MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Other Equations ..721\nAppendix A2: Solution to Equation 11.19 ..723\nAppendix A3: Solution to Equation 11.25 ..727\nAppendix A4: Solution to Equations 11.29 and 11.30 ..731\nAppendix A5: Solution to Equation 11.42 ..735\nIndex ..739\n\nNOTE: If you have problem reading this book with Adobe reader, use spme other better PDF reader like Sumatra or Foxit.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/dnlcagaaf/Microwave_Engineering_Concepts_and_Fundamental.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/dnlcagaaf/Microwave_Engineering_Concepts_and_Fundamental.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1943dd91a703b53c4ff18c7ca84c3d5ec412d08","amp;dn":"Microwave+Engineering+-+Concepts+and+Fundamentals+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1943dd91a703b53c4ff18c7ca84c3d5ec412d08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,148,61,217,26,112,59,83,196,255,24,199,202,132,195,213,236,65,45,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
