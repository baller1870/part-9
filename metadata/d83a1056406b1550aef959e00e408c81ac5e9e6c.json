But once you've built a solid foundation in the basics, how do you approach GIS challenges in the real world? Dr. Jason VanHorn is here to help you master practical GIS scenarios, and answers the 7 most common questions he receives from other GIS professionals, including: Where can I get quality data? How do I create projections? What's an inexpensive solution for collecting geospatial data? and Where can I find a GIS job?\nTopics include:\n\n    Exploring GIS trends\n    Accessing data in proprietary and catalog formats\n    Understanding GIS data formats\n    Working with scale and graticules in projections\n    Collecting geospatial data\n    Building a GIS project from scratch\n    Mastering GIS job interviews\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83a1056406b1550aef959e00e408c81ac5e9e6c","amp;dn":"Lynda.com_REAL_WORLD_GIS_TUTORIA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83a1056406b1550aef959e00e408c81ac5e9e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,58,16,86,64,107,21,80,174,249,89,224,14,64,140,129,172,94,158,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
