While watching it (before knowing the release date) I felt I was watching something out of the 1980s. Even though it may be contemporary, this film already has something &quot;aged&quot; about it. Its not exactly hackneyed, but there is something about the young people and the way they talk and act (and what they wear) that feels dated already. What especially struck me were the hairstyles and the clothing, some of the expressions and some of the mock innocence. These feel just too good, to tame, or too &quot;innocent&quot; to be credible in a movie in the 21st Century. The usual moral story, one supposes, and this time around just a bit too heavy-handed for my own personal taste. The stated gay interest or gay angle is very oblique.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8df9733c2e4ca153e801e9ff37c08d0bd01ca2","amp;dn":"%5BGay%5D+Cowboys+and+angels+2003+%2B+BG+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8df9733c2e4ca153e801e9ff37c08d0bd01ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,141,249,115,60,46,76,161,83,232,1,233,255,55,192,141,11,208,28,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
