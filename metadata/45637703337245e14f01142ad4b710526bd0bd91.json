Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil sang on Ike's early-morning radio shows in Iowa.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school, the brothers moved to Nashville where, under the wing of Ike\r\nEverly's friend, the highly talented musician Chet Atkins, Don and Phil signed with\r\nCadence Records. They exploded onto the music scene in 1957 with Bye Bye Love,\r\nwritten by Boudleaux and Felice Bryant.\r\n\r\nAfter Bye Bye Love came other hits, notably Wake Up Little Susie, followed by the\r\nworldwide smash hit All I Have to Do Is Dream and a long string of other great songs\r\nwhich also became hits.\r\n\r\nBy 1960, however, the brothers were lured away from Cadence to Warner Bros with a\r\n$1,000,000 contract. Their biggest hit followed, the self-penned Cathy's Clown, which\r\nsold 8 million copies. Remaining at Warner Bros for most of the 60s, they had further\r\nsuccess with Walk Right Back, So Sad and the King/Greenfield-penned track Crying in\r\nthe Rain.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/06343146098952432506.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/12371996237265130902.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/91101730294286070591.png\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 659 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1300 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 58mn 56s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45637703337245e14f01142ad4b710526bd0bd91","amp;dn":"BBC+%3D+The+Everly+Brothers+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45637703337245e14f01142ad4b710526bd0bd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,99,119,3,51,114,69,225,79,1,20,42,212,183,16,82,107,208,189,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
