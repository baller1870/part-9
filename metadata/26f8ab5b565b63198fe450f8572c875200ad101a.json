Like the original LP, the first disc is live, the second is studio, but there are 14 bonus tracks here. The CD art came as a four section fold out. I have also cut it down to twin fold outs to make it easier to read. Cruel Sister &amp; Reflection will follow in a few days.\n\nCover art.

In Time (Alt. version)\n\nReview\tby Matthew Greenwald\nSweet Child, released in 1968, at the peak of Pentangle's career, is probably the most representative of their work. A sprawling two-record set, half recorded in the studio and half live at the Royal Festival Hall, showcases just how versatile Pentangle was in their unique brand of English folk, jazz, Celtic, blues, and pop styles. Some of the live covers are easily their finest performances. Furry Lewis' &quot;Turn Your Money Green,&quot; sung by the delightful Jacqui McShee, swings sweetly, buttressed of course by John Renbourn and Bert Jansch's guitar tapestry. Charlie Mingus' &quot;Haitian Flight Song&quot; features a great solo by bassist Danny Thompson, who was easily one of the finest musicians to grace the instrument. The studio tracks are uniformly excellent as well, especially &quot;The Time Has Come,&quot; which turns waltz time inside out. McShee, Renbourn, and Jansch all turn in career performances on this track. But these examples merely scratch the surface of Pentangle's peak. In all, Sweet Child is an awesome and delightful collection, and probably their finest hour.remained top attractions on the folk circuit. Thompson joined John Martyn for a while, and has remained active as a session musician, in addition to recording some work of his own for the Hannibal label. The original group reunited for the reasonably accomplished Open the Door album in the early '80s, and other versions of the group recorded and toured throughout the '80s and '90s, usually featuring McShee and Jansch as the sole remaining original members.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f8ab5b565b63198fe450f8572c875200ad101a","amp;dn":"Pentangle+-+Sweet+Child+1968+2CDs+Remastered+Expanded+%2B+HR+art+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f8ab5b565b63198fe450f8572c875200ad101a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,248,171,91,86,91,99,25,143,228,80,248,87,44,135,82,0,173,16,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
