The debut album, Antony and the Johnsons, was released in 1998. In 2001, Hegarty released a short follow-up EP, I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy, which, in addition to the title track, included a cover of &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot;, a David Lynch/Angelo Badalamenti song and &quot;Soft Black Stars&quot;, a Current 93 cover.\n\nProducer Hal Willner heard the EP and played it to Lou Reed, who immediately recruited him for his project The Raven. Now gaining more attention, Hegarty signed to US-based record label Secretly Canadian, and released another EP, The Lake, with Lou Reed guest-performing on one of the tracks. Secretly Canadian also re-released Hegarty's debut album in the United States to wider distribution in 2004.\n\nAntony's second full-length album, 2005's I Am a Bird Now, was greeted with positive reviews and significantly more mainstream attention. The album featured guest appearances by Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright, Boy George and Devendra Banhart, and circled themes of duality and transformation. I Am a Bird Now featured arrangements by Maxim Moston and Julia Kent and was mixed by Doug Henderson. In September 2005 Antony and the Johnsons were awarded the Mercury Prize[1] for the best UK album of 2005. Rival Mercury nominees, and favorites for the prize, the Kaiser Chiefs suggested that Antony got in on a technicality; despite the fact he was born in the United Kingdom he spent much of his time in the US ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ although they later apologized for the suggestion that he wasn't a deserving winner.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/6931/photo2oa5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img232.imageshack.us/img232/6931/photo2oa5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n1998 - Antony and the Johnsons\n2005 - I Am a Bird Now\n\n.: EPs :.\n\nI Fell in Love with a Dead Boy - 2001\nThe Lake - 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e22fe932b103f39d2f1eccdf2763174b5b9a730","amp;dn":"Antony+and+the+Johnsons+-+Discography+1998-2005+%5BMp3+160-256+kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e22fe932b103f39d2f1eccdf2763174b5b9a730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,34,254,147,43,16,63,57,210,241,236,205,242,118,49,116,181,185,167,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
