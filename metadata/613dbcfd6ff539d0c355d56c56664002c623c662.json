The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was Little Feat's 1978 live album 'Waiting for Columbus'. &quot;Join the Band&quot; (the first track off 'Waiting for Columbus') was played over the PA before the start of the second set.  Subsequently, Phish was introduced as &quot;Little Feat&quot; before &quot;Fat Man in the Bathtub&quot;. All of the songs in the second set other than &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot; were Phish debuts. All of the songs in the second set, other than &quot;Don't Bogart That Joint&quot; and &quot;Willin' &quot;, featured Giovanni Hidalgo on percussion. A five piece horn section consisting of Aaron Johnson, Stuart Bogie, Ian Hendrickson, Michael Leonhart and Eric Biondo joined the band for &quot;Old Folks Boogie&quot;, &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot;, &quot;Day or Night&quot;, &quot;Mercenary Territory&quot;, &quot;Spanish Moon&quot;, &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot;, &quot;Rocket in My Pocket&quot; and &quot;Feats Don't Fail Me Now&quot;. &quot;Willin' &quot; featured Page on bass, Mike on piano, Trey on drums and Fish on vocals. Prior to the piano solo at the beginning of &quot;Willin' &quot;, Fish remarked, &quot;That should be Paul Barrre.&quot; &quot;Don't Bogart That Joint&quot; was performed a cappella. Trey introduced the guest musicians before &quot;Feats Don't Fail Me Now&quot;. At the conclusion of the second set, the entire band marched the perimeter of the floor. &quot;Disease&quot; was initially botched and had to be restarted, prompting Fish to declare, &quot;This one's off our album.&quot; &quot;Julius&quot; featured Giovanni Hidalgo and the 'Waiting for Columbus' horn section","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:613dbcfd6ff539d0c355d56c56664002c623c662","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2010-10-31+Boardwalk+Hall%2C+Atlantic+City%2C+NJ+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"613dbcfd6ff539d0c355d56c56664002c623c662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,61,188,253,111,245,57,208,195,85,213,108,86,102,64,2,198,35,198,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
