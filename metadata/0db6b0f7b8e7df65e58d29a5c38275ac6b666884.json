I own it and I never thought to scan it. I just figured it was already in one of the Neil Gaiman collections here at TPB. I searched them pretty thoroughly and to my surprise, it's not.

This is just an interesting loose end for completist collectors to add to their collections.\n\n&quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; is a 1994 short story written by Neil Gaiman. It was originally released as a benefit book for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (this is that edition).\n\nThe story retells the famous fairy tale of Snow White from the point of view of Snow White's stepmother, who is traditionally the villain of the piece but is here depicted as struggling desperately - and ultimately, unsuccessfully, as the &quot;happy ending&quot; takes place on schedule - to save the kingdom from her unnatural and monstrous stepdaughter.\n\nThe story incorporates themes of vampirism, incest, pedophilia, and necrophilia (don't all good stories?).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db6b0f7b8e7df65e58d29a5c38275ac6b666884","amp;dn":"Neil+Gaiman+and+Charles+Vess+-+Snow%2C+Glass%2C+Apples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db6b0f7b8e7df65e58d29a5c38275ac6b666884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,182,176,247,184,231,223,101,229,141,41,165,195,130,117,172,107,102,104,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
