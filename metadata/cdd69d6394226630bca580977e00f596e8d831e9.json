He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of \nReproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\nIn Human Instints Professor Robert Winston provides a unique insight into what \nit is that makes us human. And it is the story of our extraordinary instincts \nand why we behave the way we do and what other animals reveal about our most \nbasic drives. With intriguing experiments and secret filming he uncovers the \nsurprising science of sex. And helps us understand why one human being could \nlay down their life for another. In exploring survival, sex, competition and \nself-sacrifice, Professor Winston takes viewers on a journey of discovery into \nhuman behaviour, to look at ourselves in an entirely new way. \nHe believes the series is not science for scientists - it is about trying to \ntranslate complex ideas into something easily accessible for all. He thinks \nthe whole area of evolutionary psychology has been largely overlooked but \nthinks it&amp;#039;s fascinating. According to Winston we all carry a prehistoric \nbaggage around with us and don&amp;#039;t have full control over it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 1:\n\nIn the first programme of the Human Instinct series we explore how this most \nbasic of instincts means we&amp;#039;re all born to survive.\n\nA Baby&amp;#039;s Cry\nWithin a few hours of birth, many animals are not only feeding but standing up \nand walking around. By comparison human babies are virtually useless. So the \nmost important weapon in a baby&amp;#039;s survival armoury is an astounding scream. It \ncan reach 97 decibels - equivalent to a pneumatic drill. Babies alter both the \npitch and volume depending on how urgent their need of help. The louder and \nmore piercing the scream the quicker the response. With this simple tactic a \nhuman baby ensures it gets all it needs - attention, loving care and of course \nfood.\n\nA Question of Taste\nWithout food we die. But can our instinct to eat explain why we all crave \nfatty, often unhealthy, food? Like all our instincts, our appetites were \nformed millions of years ago. In this uncertain world, laying down fat was the \nperfect way to ensure against times when food was scarce. Our ancestors who \ncraved food which was high in calories and rich in fat lived and passed on \ntheir genes to their children - those who didn&amp;#039;t, died and left no \ndescendents. Gradually, over millions of years, that craving for calories \nbecame instinctive behaviour. But there&amp;#039;s an even more sophisticated side to \nour craving for food. We also instinctively know what is safe to eat and what \nis not. \n\nThe Feeling of Fear\nEach year at the Pamplona bull run hundreds of people put their survival \ninstincts to the test. Their heart rates soar as they are chased through the \nstreets by angry bulls. They are experiencing fear. This instinctive feeling \nis so important for our survival, our body reacts before our conscious mind \nhas even registered the danger. Adrenaline floods the body preparing us to \nfight or run. \n\nA Gambling Instinct\nMillions of years ago our distant ancestors were constantly choosing between \nrisky options, balancing threats from predators and unknown landscapes against \npotential rewards. We&amp;#039;re all descended from those humans that took risks and \nwon and went on to populate the world. And this most complicated of survival \ninstincts explains why modern humans just love the thrill of gambling.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe file have two audio tracks. One is english and one is chinese. The easiest thing is to play the file in VLC player or other player who support two tracks. English is default in VLC player.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd69d6394226630bca580977e00f596e8d831e9","amp;dn":"BBC+Human+Instinct+-+Part+1+of+4+-+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd69d6394226630bca580977e00f596e8d831e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,214,157,99,148,34,102,48,188,165,128,151,126,0,245,150,232,216,49,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
