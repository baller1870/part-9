The album was recorded on magnetic (analogue) tape. \n\nTheir second studio release since the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the album features the band's first ever fully acoustic track, &quot;Journeyman&quot;, as well as their only song co-written by drummer Nicko McBrain, &quot;New Frontier&quot;. As with its predecessor, 2000's Brave New World, the record was produced by Kevin Shirley, who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n  \n01. \t&quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;   \tAdrian Smith, Steve Harris \t3:52\n02. \t&quot;Rainmaker&quot;   \tDave Murray, Harris, Bruce Dickinson \t3:48\n03. \t&quot;No More Lies&quot;   \tHarris \t7:21\n04. \t&quot;MontsÃƒÂ©gur&quot;   \tJanick Gers, Harris, Dickinson \t5:50\n05. \t&quot;Dance of Death&quot;   \tGers, Harris \t8:36\n06. \t&quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot;   \tGers, Harris, Dickinson \t5:12\n07. \t&quot;New Frontier&quot;   \tNicko McBrain, Smith, Dickinson \t5:04\n08. \t&quot;Paschendale&quot;   \tSmith, Harris \t8:27\n09. \t&quot;Face in the Sand&quot;   \tSmith, Harris, Dickinson \t6:31\n10. \t&quot;Age of Innocence&quot;   \tMurray, Harris \t6:10\n11. \t&quot;Journeyman&quot;   \tSmith, Harris, Dickinson \t7:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4652c646186f2d535a907ddd4a026d6a02ac9f1","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Dance+Of+Death+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4652c646186f2d535a907ddd4a026d6a02ac9f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,101,44,100,97,134,242,213,53,169,7,221,212,160,38,214,160,42,201,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
