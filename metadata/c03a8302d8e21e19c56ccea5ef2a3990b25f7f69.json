Continuing on as Damon &amp; Naomi, their latest album is called Fortune.\nWhile the album is being released in traditional formats Ã¢â‚¬â€ Fortune is actually a soundtrack for YangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s otherwise-silent film of the same name. An announcement explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The visuals are so bound up in the music (and vice-versa) that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more of a long-form music video, a visual poem set to the metronome of a textural score.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThe piece was inspired by the recent passing of YangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, a photographer who left behind a huge archive of work. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a tarot card theme, plus painted portraits from the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢40s and Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s. Despite the importance of the visuals, however, the music is designed to stand alone.\nThis followÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bootleg Edition of the 1995 album The Wondrous World of Damon &amp; Naomi. Their most recent new studio album was 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s False Beats and True Hearts.\nRating 7/10\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 - The Seeker.flac\n02 - Amnesia.flac\n03 - It's Over.flac\n04 - Reflections.flac\n05 - A Shining Dream.flac\n06 - Shadows.flac\n07 - Towards Tomorrow.flac\n08 - Sky Memories.flac\n09 - Hurt House.flac\n10 - The North Light.flac\n11 - Time Won't Own Me.flac01 - The Seeker.flac\n02 - Amnesia.flac\n03 - It's Over.flac\n04 - Reflections.flac\n05 - A Shining Dream.flac\n06 - Shadows.flac\n07 - Towards Tomorrow.flac\n08 - Sky Memories.flac\n09 - Hurt House.flac\n10 - The North Light.flac\n11 - Time Won't Own Me.flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Indie-Folk\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~746-962 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03a8302d8e21e19c56ccea5ef2a3990b25f7f69","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Damon+%26amp%3B+Naomi+-+Fortune+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03a8302d8e21e19c56ccea5ef2a3990b25f7f69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,58,131,2,216,226,30,25,197,108,206,165,239,42,57,144,178,95,127,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
