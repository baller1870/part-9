KISS formed in 1973 and broke new ground with their elaborate makeup, live theatrics, and powerful sound. The band emerged as one of the most iconic hard rock acts in music history. Peter Criss, the Catman, was the heartbeat of the group. From an elevated perch on his pyrotechnic drum riser, he had a unique vantage point on the greatest rock show of all time, with the KISS Army looking back at him night after night.\n\nPeter Criscuola had come a long way from the homemade drum set he pounded on nonstop as a kid growing up in Brooklyn in the fifties. He endured lean years, street violence, and the rollercoaster music scene of the sixties, but he always knew heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d make it. Makeup to Breakup is Peter CrissÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye-opening journey from the pledge to his ma that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d one day play Madison Square Garden to doing just that. He conquered the rock worldÃ¢â‚¬â€composing and singing his bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-time biggest hit, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BethÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (1976)Ã¢â‚¬â€but he also faced the perils of stardom and his own mortality, including drug abuse, treatment in 1982, near-suicides, two broken marriages, and a hard-won battle with breast cancer.\n\nCriss opens up with a level of honesty and emotion previously unseen in any musicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir. Makeup to Breakup is the definitive and heartfelt account of one of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic figures, and the importance of faith and family. Rock Ã¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll has been chronicled many times, but never quite like this.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - October 23rd 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a21e9951e72599bfbcf34084e72986b1773818","amp;dn":"Makeup+to+Breakup+-+My+Life+In+and+Out+of+Kiss+by+Peter+Criss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a21e9951e72599bfbcf34084e72986b1773818","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,162,30,153,81,231,37,153,191,188,243,64,132,231,41,134,177,119,56,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
