More than a diatribe against the trade, La Cecla makes a call to rethink urban space and take the cities back from Ã‚â€œcasino capitalismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that has left a string of failed urban projects, such as the Sagrera of Barcelona and the expansion of Columbia University in New York City. Recounting his travels across the globe, La Cecla provides insights to aid in resisting the planners and to find the spirit of a place. These commentaries on the works of past and present masters of urban and landscape will take an important place in continued public discourse for years to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992730c98423893399ffa6ded21cc61dafa17dc7","amp;dn":"Against+Architecture+%28Art+Essay+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992730c98423893399ffa6ded21cc61dafa17dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,39,48,201,132,35,137,51,153,255,166,222,210,28,198,29,175,161,125,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
