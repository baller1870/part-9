The female side of her family tree is dotted with funny storytellers, prolific authors, hospitable home cooks, and champion chatters.\n\nIn We Love, We Laugh, We Cook, BeckyÃ¢â‚¬â€a butter and bacon loving mamaÃ¢â‚¬â€and RachelÃ¢â‚¬â€a vegan bean eating daughterÃ¢â‚¬â€share stories of their crazy, wonderful, and sometimes challenging lives as Rachel becomes a mother herself.\n\nBecky is messy; Rachel craves order. Becky forgets what month it is; Rachel is an organizational genius. (At least before baby arrives.) Sprinkled throughout are the lip-smacking, nourishing recipes they love to make and share.\n\nFrom food for a family reunion of thirty, to lunch for a party of one in a high chair, to a hot meal for a sick friend, the authors demonstrate grace, acceptance, and love to others through the bonding gifts of humor, attentive listening, and cooking Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ whether  diners prefer beef or tofu in their stew.\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nAs anyone who watches Dr. Phil can attest, relations between mothers and daughters may generate accusations and acrimony. So itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s refreshing to find two women who have found as much joy in each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s company as this pair apparently has. Their happiness becomes most obvious in their shared love of food and cooking. Rachel put her mother BeckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affection to the test when she embraced veganism, but they soon learned how to turn this into a positive learning experience. Their Christian faith shepherds them through such life crises as failed marriage. The pairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cooking style sometimes relies on boxed cake mixes and other prepared foods, but they do not lack real appreciation for fresh ingredients. Recipes accompany each chapter and offer vegetarian and vegan alternatives as appropriate. --Mark Knoblauch\n\nReview\n\nJohnson, author of a number of books on subjects ranging from family humor to brain science, and Randolph, her grown daughter, team up in this quirky memoir with recipes, Johnson, diagnosed with Inattentive ADD, is scatterbrained, sloppy, and disorganized, while Randolph likes her ducks in a row. Organization was my form of teenage rebellion,' writes Randolph, while her mom admits that during these years, the smoke alarm often served as the dinner bell. Johnson is a self-proclaimed bacon and butter lover; Randolph is vegan. The authors toss anecdotes back and forth throughout the folksy chapters, sharing stories of a loving family in which 'hospitality is a way of life.' Between slices of life, the mom-daughter duo offers an eclectic array of recipes (main entrees, sides, appetizers, soups, desserts, etc.) ranging from spicy puttanesca sauce to cashew queso and roasted-corn bean salsa (Randolph is lives in Texas, while Johnson resides in Colorado). Recognizing that many contemporary families, like theirs, include members with varying dietary preferences and needs, the authors provide instructions on how to alter recipes to please and appease vegetarians, vegans, and the gluten- free. Amusing, endearing, and spiced with a close mother-daughter bond, the authors interweave their humor and cooking advice with sincere gratitude for the blessings of breaking bread with family and friends","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:842690cfe8df55637be2c02988de66a0a37db10e","amp;dn":"We+Laugh%2C+We+Cry%2C+We+Cook+-+Becky+Johnson+%26amp%3B+Rachel+Randolf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"842690cfe8df55637be2c02988de66a0a37db10e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,38,144,207,232,223,85,99,123,226,192,41,136,222,102,160,163,125,177,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
