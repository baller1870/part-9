First comes a trespassing Indian and the dream of wolves running wild amongst the cattle lately brought by settlers. \n  Having trapped a she-wolf, Billy sets forth at the age of sixteen to restore her to the mountains of Mexico. He is long gone and returns to find everything he left behind transformed utterly. With his kid brother Boyd, he strikes out to reclaim what is theirs. And in this wider world they fight a war as rageful as the one back home. One brother finds his destiny, while the other arrives only at his fate. \n - - -\n\n  From Wiki:\n\nCormac McCarthy, is an American novelist and playwright. He received the Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for 'The Road,' and his 2005 novel 'No Country for Old Men' was adapted as a 2007 film of the same name, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. He received a National Book Award in 1992 for 'All the Pretty Horses.'\n\nLike its predecessor, All the Pretty Horses, it is a coming-of-age novel set on the lands bordering the southern United States and Mexico. The plot takes place before and during the Second World War, and focuses on the life of Billy Parham, the protagonist, a teenage cowboy, his family and his younger brother Boyd. The story tells of three journeys taken from New Mexico to Mexico. It is noted for being a more melancholic novel than the first of the trilogy, without returning to the hellish bleakness of McCarthy's early novels.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c5cf075b3fa528c4f9b21c29b3b2314ea77f42","amp;dn":"THE+CROSSING+-+Cormac+McCarthy.+Read+Alexander+Adams+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c5cf075b3fa528c4f9b21c29b3b2314ea77f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,197,207,7,91,63,165,40,196,249,178,28,41,179,178,49,78,167,127,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
