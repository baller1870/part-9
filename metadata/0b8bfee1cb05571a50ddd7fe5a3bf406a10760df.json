However, it is much shorter and is exclusively directed toward an undergraduate audience. Teachers and students will find the list of important concepts and terms in each chapter a helpful guide, and will appreciate the radically different dynamic figures and lively photographs. The content of all chapters has been updated, and material has been reorganized into new chapters such as &quot;Conflict and Cooperation&quot; and &quot;How To Be Fit.&quot; Contributors Scott M. Edwards and John R. True have provided authoritative chapters on &quot;Evolution of Genes and Genomes&quot; and &quot;Development and Evolution,&quot; two of the most rapidly developing subjects in evolutionary biology. A new final chapter on &quot;Evolutionary Science, Creationism, and Society&quot; treats such topics as the nature of science and the practical applications of evolutionary biology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b8bfee1cb05571a50ddd7fe5a3bf406a10760df","amp;dn":"Futuyma+%282005%29+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b8bfee1cb05571a50ddd7fe5a3bf406a10760df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,139,254,225,203,5,87,26,80,221,215,254,90,59,244,6,161,7,96,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
