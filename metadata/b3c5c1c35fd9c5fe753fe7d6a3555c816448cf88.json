The emphasis is on his tone, his distinctive octaves, and his melody statements. Some of the material (such as &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Matchmaker, Matchmaker&quot;) are pop tunes of the era and the brass orchestra (arranged by Johnny Pate) is purely in the background, but there are some worthy performances, chiefly the two-part &quot;Movin' Wes,&quot; &quot;Born to Be Blue,&quot; and &quot;West Coast Blues.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nWes Montgomery (Guitar) \nJerome Richardson (Woodwinds) \nJimmy Cleveland (Trombone) \nUrbie Green (Trombone) \nQuentin Jackson (Trombone) \nChauncey Welsch (Trombone) \nErnie Royal (Trumpet) \nClark Terry (Trumpet) \nSnookie Young (Trumpet) \nDon Butterfield (Tuba) \nBobby Scott (Piano) \nBob Cranshaw (Double Bass) \nGrady Tate (Drums) \nWillie Bobo (Percussion) \n\nWes Montgomery - Movin' Wes Tracks:\n01  Caravan (Duke Ellington/Irving Mills/Juan Tizol) 2:40 \n02  People (Bob Merrill/Jule Styne) 4:25 \n03  Movin' Wes-Part I (Wes Montgomery) 3:16 \n04  Moca Flor (Durval Ferreira/Lula Freire) 3:13 \n05  Matchmaker, Matchmaker (Jerry Bock/Sheldon Harnick) 2:49\n06  Movin' Wes-Part II (Wes Montgomery) 2:37 \n07  The Phoenix Love Theme (Paoli/Wilder) 3:24 \n08  Theodora (Creed Taylor) 3:59 \n09  In And Out (Wes Montgomery) 2:50 \n10  Born To Be Blue (Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©/Robert Wells) 3:42 \n11  West Coast Blues (Wes Montgomery) 3:11","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c5c1c35fd9c5fe753fe7d6a3555c816448cf88","amp;dn":"Wes+Montgomery+-+Movin%5C%27+Wes+%281965%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c5c1c35fd9c5fe753fe7d6a3555c816448cf88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,197,193,195,95,217,197,254,117,63,231,214,163,85,92,129,100,72,207,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
