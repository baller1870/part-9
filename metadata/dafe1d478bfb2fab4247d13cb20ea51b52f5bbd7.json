Critchley works from within the tradition of continental philosophy. He argues that philosophy commences in disappointment, either religious or political. These two axes may be said to inform his published work: religious disappointment raises the question of meaning and has to, as he sees it, deal with the problem of nihilism; political disappointment provokes the question of justice and raises the need for a coherent ethics.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in PDF format unless otherwise stated:\n\n* (1992) The Ethics of Deconstruction - Derrida and Levinas\n\n* (1996) Deconstruction and Pragmatism (Simon Critchley, Jacques Derrida, Ernesto Laclau and Richard Rorty) - Edited by Chantal Mouffe\n\n* (1997) Very Little...
