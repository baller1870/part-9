With considerable help from Butthole Surfer Paul Leary, Johnston has never sounded so self-assured or confident before. Some of the songs are more polished, but they're never slicked up to such a degree that this sounds like a user-friendly approximation of Johnston's style; in fact, there are plenty of tracks that return Johnston to the keyboards (&quot;Delusion &amp; Confusion&quot; and &quot;My Little Girl&quot;) for his freewheeling, primitive workouts. Exhibiting some of his strongest songwriting to date, Fun is a rewarding record that never loses its initial, visceral appeal.
