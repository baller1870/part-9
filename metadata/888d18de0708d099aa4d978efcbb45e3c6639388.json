For \nthe first time ever, Roth delves into the realm of alternate history \nwith the astounding novel that builds from the premise: What if Charles \nA. Lindbergh, a noted anti-semite, defeated FDR in the 1940 presidential \nelection? Listeners hungry for thought-provoking fiction with \ncontemporary relevance will find a veritable feast.\n\n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe Plot Against America is an alternate history in which Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by \nCharles Lindbergh.\n\nThe novel follows the fortunes of the Roth family during the Lindbergh \npresidency, as antisemitism becomes more accepted in American life and \nJewish-American families like the Roths are persecuted on various \nlevels. The narrator and central character in the novel is the young \nPhilip, and the care with which his confusion and terror are rendered \nmakes the novel as much about the mysteries of growing up as about \nAmerican politics. Roth based his novel on the isolationist ideas \nespoused by Lindbergh in real life as a spokesman for the America First \nCommittee and his own experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The \nnovel depicts the Weequahic section of Newark which includes Weequahic \nHigh School from which Roth graduated.\n\n\n* ABA Book Sense Book of the Year: Adult Fiction Honor Book\n* National Book CriticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Circle Award Finalist\n* A Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year\n* A New York Times Best Book of the Year\n* James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n -Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n&gt;&gt;The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888d18de0708d099aa4d978efcbb45e3c6639388","amp;dn":"THE+PLOT+AGAINST+AMERICA+-+Philip+Roth.+Ron+Silver+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888d18de0708d099aa4d978efcbb45e3c6639388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,141,24,222,7,8,208,153,170,77,151,142,252,187,69,227,198,99,147,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
