These initial flights would develop into the &quot;black&quot; or classified program known internally as Constant Peg.\n\n At a secret air base in Nevada, ace American fighter pilots were presented with a range of differnet MiG jets with a simple remit: to expose &quot;the threat&quot; to as many of their brethern as possible. Maintaining and flying these &quot;assets&quot; without without spare parts or manuals was an almost impossible task, putting those flying the MiGs in mortal danger on every flight.\n\n Despite these challenges, in all more than 5,900 American aircrews would train against America's secret MiGs, giving them the eskills they needed to face the enemy in real combat situations.\n\n For the first time, this book tells the story of Constant Peg and the 4477th Red Eagles Squadron in the words of the men who made it possible.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Red-Eagles-Americas-General-Aviation/dp/1846039703&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Red-Eagles-Americas-General-Aviation/dp/1846039703&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7bd25093ef927f72d12a5817ea0ee92483f1c4e","amp;dn":"Red+Eagles%3A+Americas+Secret+MiGs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7bd25093ef927f72d12a5817ea0ee92483f1c4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,189,37,9,62,249,39,247,45,18,165,129,126,160,238,146,72,63,28,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
