Attempts to undermine Scottish independence by King Edward I of England sparked open rebellion culminating in an English defeat at the hands of William Wallace at Stirling Bridge in 1297. Edward gathered an army, marched north and at Falkirk on 22 July 1298 he brought WallaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army to battle. Amid accusations of treachery, WallaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spearmen were slaughtered by EdwardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longbowmen, then charged by the English cavalry and almost annihilated. In 1305 Wallace was captured and executed, but the flame of rebellion he had ignited could not be extinguished","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc380b6da281f19a1e0d900f241e28c7f55d974","amp;dn":"Stirling+Bridge+and+Falkirk+1297-98%3A+William+Wallace%27s+Rebellion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc380b6da281f19a1e0d900f241e28c7f55d974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,195,128,182,218,40,31,25,161,224,217,0,242,65,226,140,127,85,217,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
