In recent decades, advances in our knowledge of the brain are causing us to question many of the theories underlying traditional approaches to diagnosing and treating these disorders. Researchers in diverse fieldsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½molecular genetics, behavioral, cognitive and clinical neuroscience, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and neurologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have contributed to the advances. The new knowledge that has been amassed should inform work with clients, but for most practitioners and practitioners-in-trainingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who lack specialized backgroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it has been difficult to grasp. In this book, specifically designed to meet the needs of graduate students in clinical, counseling and school psychology programs, Lisa Weyandt offers a comprehensive, up-to-date, readable overview of our current understanding of the biological bases of psychopathology and its implications for intervention. Early chapters concisely and clearly explain the basics of brain structure and function and current research techniques; they set the stage for chapters examining each major group of disorders. An extensive art program underlines the important points.
