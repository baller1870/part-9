Characters include: Adolph Hitler's melodious half-brother whose singing style is hilariously\nclose to that of Julio Iglesias, a &quot;good&quot; German officer, stereotypical of any of those found in post-World War II movies, and a\nwoman who provides the comedy in a 1970s television talk show when she expounds on what really happened in the Paris villa back when.\nIt is the acting which carries the day for this film, more than the actual script or cinematic development.
