A galaxy of discontinuous images. With a new presentation of the conflict between the coast and the sertÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o, the film Triste TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pico, by Arthur Omar, proposes a criticism, full of irony and hallucination, of the anthropological discourse in the tropics. Its main character, a surprising petit bourgeois doctor, embarks on a journey that will invert the sense of Levi-Strauss demarche, as expressed in his book TristeTropique. The allegory of Cinema Novo was conceived as an unveiling, whereas the allegory of Triste TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pico is a movement towards opacity, and what poses a problem is the very act of reading. Triste TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³pico is meta-cinema and, from this point of view, it is different from the forms of anti-colonialism of the 70s in Brazil. (Ismail Xavier, in the book Allegories of Underdevelopment) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe9ced147102161a05fdd8ce796e74d66c1ed83a","amp;dn":"Artur+Omar+-+Triste+Tro%C3%8C%C2%81pico+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe9ced147102161a05fdd8ce796e74d66c1ed83a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,156,237,20,113,2,22,26,5,253,216,206,121,110,116,214,108,30,216,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
