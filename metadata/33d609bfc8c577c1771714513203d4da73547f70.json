My mouth opened, but I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t draw breath. His lips, pearly wet, parted and he blew into my mouth. My lungs expanded beneath his weight. When I exhaled he sucked my breath in and his weight turned from cold marble into warm living flesh. \n\nSince accepting a teaching position at remote Fairwick College in upstate New York, Callie McFay has experienced the same disturbingly erotic dream every night: A mist enters her bedroom, then takes the shape of a virile, seductive stranger who proceeds to ravish her in the most toe-curling, wholly satisfying ways possible. Perhaps these dreams are the result of her having written the bestselling book The Sex Lives of Demon Lovers. CallieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifelong passion is the intersection of lurid fairy tales and Gothic literatureÃ¢â‚¬â€which is why sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found herself at FairwickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renowned folklore department, living in a once-stately Victorian house that, at first sight, seemed to call her name.\n\nBut Callie soon realizes that her dreams are alarmingly real. She has a demon loverÃ¢â‚¬â€an incubusÃ¢â‚¬â€and he will seduce her, pleasure her, and eventually suck the very life from her. Then Callie makes another startling discovery: Her incubus is not the only mythical creature in Fairwick. As the tenured witches of the college and the resident fairies in the surrounding woods prepare to cast out the demon, Callie must accomplish something infinitely more difficultÃ¢â‚¬â€banishing this supernatural lover from her heart.\n\n\nGenre: Romance | Fantasy | Paranormal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d609bfc8c577c1771714513203d4da73547f70","amp;dn":"Juliet+Dark+-+The+Demon+Lover+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d609bfc8c577c1771714513203d4da73547f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,214,9,191,200,197,119,193,119,23,20,81,50,3,212,218,115,84,127,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
