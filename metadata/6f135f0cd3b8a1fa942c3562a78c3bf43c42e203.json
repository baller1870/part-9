Looney Tunes and\nMerrie Melodies series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio\nto draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators (particularly Bob Clampett)\ncreated many critically acclaimed shorts using the fat little pig. Even after he was\nsupplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and,\nmore importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and\nsidekick roles. He is known for his signature line at the end of each short,\n'Th-th-th-that's all folks!' The slogan had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy\nand even Beans at the end of every Looney Tunes cartoon. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies\nseries used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the late 1930s when it was replaced with\nthe same one used on the Looney Tunes series.\n(When Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying,\nin his Brooklynese accent, 'And Dat's De End!'). He is the oldest continuing Looney\nTunes character.\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN DONE DOWNLOADING!!!!!\n\n\nMORE TO COME!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f135f0cd3b8a1fa942c3562a78c3bf43c42e203","amp;dn":"Porky+Pig+Pack+%281935-1996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f135f0cd3b8a1fa942c3562a78c3bf43c42e203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,19,95,12,211,184,161,250,148,44,53,98,167,140,59,244,60,66,226,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
