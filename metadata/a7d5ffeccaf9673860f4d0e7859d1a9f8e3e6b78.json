Described by the duo as &quot;much more up&quot; then anything they have previously recorded, the album has a heavy Indian influence and a psychedelic feel. Features contributions from Indian classical violinist Dr. L. Subramaniam as well as vocals by Liam Gallagher, Paul Weller and Adult.&amp;#039;s Nicola Kuperus. Includes the singles &amp;#039;Leather&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Girls&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Natja&amp;#039;, and &amp;#039;Hands Around My Throat&amp;#039;.\n\n\nLeave it to Death In Vegas. Whilst other erstwhile dance acts who could once have been considered ground-breaking are stuck rubbing their chins and wondering when the next bandwagon leaves, DIV will always be the ones driving the bus. Having caught the live bug a couple of years back, the new DIV album was always going to have more of a live rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll vibe. It&amp;#039;s just that no-one guessed it would be the same sort of vibe you get from Mexican wrestling. Or peepshow neon. Or voodoo disco dollies. &amp;#039;Scorpio Rising&amp;#039; is a dense and sometimes claustrophobic collection of aphorisms that is part Lynch movie, part FBI incident report, part crunching rawk jam. Weller and Gallagher minor both guest and take to their tasks admirably but the gong for the best heaving vocals must go to Hope Sandoval who injects the proceedings with a weary yet utterly seductive believability.\n\n\nRolling Stone (5/29/03, p.62) - 3 stars out of 5 - &quot;...An ambitious effort where acid-damaged instrumentals exist alongside songs sung by superstar guests...&quot;\n\n\nSpin (08/03, pp.114-6) - &quot;...Comes terrifyingly close to brilliance....[Dives] into a murky world of sexed-up electro-sleaze and serial killer chic...&quot; - Grade: B+\n\n\nCMJ (6/23/03, p.6) - &quot;...Weaves a common thread through everything from fuzzed-out shoegazing...to tripped-out flashback rock...&quot; \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d5ffeccaf9673860f4d0e7859d1a9f8e3e6b78","amp;dn":"Death+In+Vegas+-+Scorpio+Rising","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d5ffeccaf9673860f4d0e7859d1a9f8e3e6b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,213,255,236,202,249,103,56,96,244,208,231,133,157,26,159,142,62,107,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
