Created by ageing Dr. Foe in order to care for his ailing wife, Xian, Palme slowly begins to learn about the human soul and the power of love. Despite the well-intending robot's best efforts, Xian eventually dies of a heart attack and Palme becomes sullen and withdrawn. A passing female warrior later gives Foe a magical bowl from the land of God on the agreement that he will transport it to the underground city of Tamas, and though the old man promises to fulfill her wishes, he is subsequently slain by one of Koram's adversaries. Requesting that Palme fulfill the mission as death approaches, the nurturing robot must now leave the comfort of his home and embark on a journey that will teach him the true meaning of humanity and the human spirit. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi from fandango.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d6b22fdbcb2e086c3cd70116f5e1ad71062534","amp;dn":"A+Tree+of+Palme+%28Dual+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d6b22fdbcb2e086c3cd70116f5e1ad71062534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,214,178,47,219,203,46,8,108,60,215,1,22,245,225,173,113,6,37,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
