Disc one was filmed at the Grugahalle in Essen, Germany for the Rockpalast TV series. Hot on the heels of their classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeguelloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album (it features 9 of the 10 songs from it) the show finds ZZ Top before sequencers and synthesizers epitomising their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ olÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ blues band from TexasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ nickname. Complimented by tracks drawn predominantly from their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTres HombresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFandango!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ albums this is a true best of ZZ Top in the seventies. Disc Two was shot during their European tour in 2008 and combines great live performances, interview clips and back stage footage to create the ultimate ZZ Top on the road movie. With nearly 30 years between the performances the two disc set gives a fascinating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthen and nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ insight into what has maintained the ZZ Top live phenomenon.\n\n# Actors: ZZ Top\n# Directors: n, a\n# Format: Best of, Color, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, DVD, Live, NTSC\n# Language: English\n# Region: All Regions\n# Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n# Number of discs: 2\n# Rated: Unrated\n# Studio: Eagle Records (Fontana)\n# DVD Release Date: October 20, 2009\n# Run Time: 154 minutes\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\nDisc One ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Definitely Then 1980:\n1) I Thank You\n2) WaitinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ For the Bus\n3) Jesus Just Left Chicago\n4) Precious And Grace\n5) IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Bad, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Nationwide\n6) Manic Mechanic\n7) Lowdown In The Street\n8) Heard It On The X\n9) Fool For Your Stockings\n10) Nasty Dogs &amp; Funky Kings\n11) El Diablo\n12) Cheap Sunglasses\n13) Arrested For Driving While Blind\n14) Beer Drinkers &amp; Hell Raisers\n15) La Grange\n16) She Loves My Automobile\n17) Hi Fi Mama\n18) Dust My Broom\n19) Jailhouse Rock\n20) Tush\n21) Tube Snake Boogie\n22) Just Got Paid\n\nDisc Two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Almost Now 2008:\n1) Got Me Under Pressure\n2) WaitinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ For The Bus\n3) Jesus Just Left Chicago\n4) IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Bad, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Nationwide\n5) Blue Jean Blues\n6) Heard It On The X\n7) Just Got Paid\n8) I Need You Tonight\n9) La Grange (with Sloppy Drunk &amp; Bar-B-Q)\n10) Hey Joe\n11) Tush\n\n\nEnjoy the show, and don't be shy about leaving comments!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e69d025593461eaa670ddb35773607958459a62","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+-+Double+Down+Live+%5B2009%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e69d025593461eaa670ddb35773607958459a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,105,208,37,89,52,97,234,166,112,221,179,87,115,96,121,88,69,154,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
