The teacher client, by default, will only scan one\nchannel or &quot;room&quot; at a time for active computers.\n\nThis can be overrided with a simple registry edit after installation.\n\nI've taken the liberty to include the registry modification in this \ntorrent. It's the file called &quot;scan all channels.reg&quot;. Just double-click\nto apply the fix. Be sure to restart the application afterward.\n\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d17945adadb4b57e121ba1d0a3c69dc54c8f30e","amp;dn":"LanSchool+7.0.0.7+Teacher+and+Student+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d17945adadb4b57e121ba1d0a3c69dc54c8f30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,23,148,90,218,219,75,87,225,33,186,29,10,60,105,220,84,200,243,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
