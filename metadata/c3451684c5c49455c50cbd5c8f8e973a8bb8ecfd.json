By thirty-five, she is already everything she ever imagined being -- a partner in a successful law firm, a competitive runner, and a girlfriend to a devoted investment banker. Her life is challenging and full, but somehow uneventful. \n\nAfter a near fatal attack, Sara is thrown together with Rachel Collins, a charming but secretive art dealer living in the northern suburbs of San Antonio. Sara is immediately drawn to Rachel, but the closer the two women become, the more Rachel pulls away.\n\nTogether, the two women explore a dark world Sara never knew existed -- a world that challenges her very notions of life, death, and love.\n\nWaking Forever is the first in a series of three books in the Waking Forever series. Book two, Becoming Forever is scheduled for release in January 2014, and the final book in the series, Dying Forever will be released the summer of 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3451684c5c49455c50cbd5c8f8e973a8bb8ecfd","amp;dn":"FF+Heather+McVea+-+Waking+Forever+%28Waking+Forever+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3451684c5c49455c50cbd5c8f8e973a8bb8ecfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,69,22,132,197,196,148,85,197,12,189,92,143,142,151,58,139,184,236,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
