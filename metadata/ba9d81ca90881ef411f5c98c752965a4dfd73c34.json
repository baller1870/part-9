Cochrane fronted the Canadian rock band Red Rider and has won seven Juno Awards. He is a member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, an Officer of the Order of Canada, has an Honorary Doctorate from Brandon University and is an Honorary Colonel in the Canadian Air Force. In September 2009, he was inducted onto the Canadian Walk of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Red Rider\n\n\nRed Rider was a Canadian rock band popular in the 1980s. While the band achieved great success in Canada, in the US, the band never had a song in the Top 40.\n\nIn 1978, Tom Cochrane joined up with Rob Baker on drums, Jeff Jones on bass, Peter Boynton on keyboards and Ken Greer to form Red Rider. They were signed to Capitol Records and released their first album Don't Fight It in 1980. With the singles &quot;White Hot&quot; and &quot;Don't Fight It&quot;, the album quickly reached gold status. Their second album As Far as Siam was released in 1981 and featured the hit &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; which was used in the 1985 movie Vision Quest and which is now a mainstay on American classic rock radio. The song also saw high rotation on the United States cable network MTV. Two other tracks, &quot;Cowboys in Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;What Have You Got To Do&quot; were featured in an episode of Miami Vice. Boynton was replaced by keyboardist Steve Sexton on Red Rider's third album Neruda, released in 1983. The track &quot;Napoleon Sheds His Skin&quot; would become one of the more popular songs from the album.\n\nFor their 1984 album Breaking Curfew, John Webster replaced Sexton on keyboards. The album did not sell as well as Neruda and a dispute with Capitol Records over the future direction of the band resulted in Red Rider being dropped from the record label later in 1984.\n\nThe band subsequently signed with RCA. In what became a strong signal regarding the future of the band, they officially became known as Tom Cochrane and Red Rider, and released their self-titled fifth album in 1986 which included Ken &quot;Spider&quot; Sinnaeve on bass.\n\nIn 1987, Capitol released a compilation CD titled Over 60 Minutes with Red Rider, covering the band's first four albums.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, the band released their sixth album Victory Day which contained the track &quot;Big League,&quot; about the death of a young hockey player. The young man's father approached Cochrane on the day of a concert, mentioning that his son was a big fan of Red Rider's song, &quot;Boy Inside The Man.&quot; Cochrane asked the man if his son was going to be attending the concert, and the man responded that his son had recently died in a car accident.[1] Another note about &quot;Big League&quot; is that Cochrane and Greer played it at GM place at the start of the 08/09 hockey season to commemorate the passing of Luc Bourdon, a member of the Vancouver Canucks. The song was featured in a segment on CBC Television's Hockey Night in Canada.\n\nRed Rider's final album, The Symphony Sessions, was released in 1989 and saw the band performing with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, as Procol Harum had done seventeen years before. Cochrane's solo career was taking off and the band broke up shortly after the album was released.\n\nThe three-CD box set Ashes to Diamonds, which includes material by both Red Rider and Cochrane as a solo artist, was released in 1993. Professional wrestler Kurt Angle uses an instrumental version of Lunatic Fringe as his entrance music in TNA. UFC fighter and former Pride Champion Dan &quot;Hendo&quot; Henderson uses Lunatic Fringe as his intro song.\n\nCochrane, Greer and Jones reunited in 2002, and have been touring as Tom Cochrane and Red Rider since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Fight It 1980\n\n\nDon't Fight It is the debut album for the Canadian rock band Red Rider, which was released in 1980 (see 1980 in music). With the singles &quot;White Hot&quot; and &quot;Don't Fight It&quot;, the album quickly reached gold status. The album was re-issued on CD July 29, 1994.\n\nThe album reached #146 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart while &quot;White Hot&quot; reached #20 on the Canadian charts and #48 on the Pop Singles chart in 1980 and &quot;Don't Fight It&quot; reached #75.\n\nThe song &quot;White Hot&quot; is about poet Arthur Rimbaud and his travels through Africa.[1]\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Don't Fight It&quot; (Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n2.\t&quot;How's My Little Girl Tonight&quot; (Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n3.\t&quot;Iron in the Soul&quot; (Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n4.\t&quot;Make Myself Complete&quot; (Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n5.\t&quot;Good News&quot; (Boynton, Jones) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n6.\t&quot;White Hot&quot; (Cochrane, Greer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n7.\t&quot;Talkin' to Myself&quot; (Boynton) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n8.\t&quot;Just the Way it Goes&quot; (Cochrane, Greer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n9.\t&quot;Look Out Again&quot; (Boynton, Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n10.\t&quot;Avenue 'A'&quot; (Cochrane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Far As Siam 1981\n\n\nAs Far as Siam is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Red Rider, which was released in 1981. The album was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles. The album reached #65 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart in 1981. The single &quot;What Have You Got to do (To Get Off Tonight)&quot; peaked at #16 on the Canadian charts.\n\n&quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot;, the band's most famous song, is about what composer Tom Cochrane saw as an alarming rise of anti-Semitism in the 1970s, and was inspired by a book he read about Raoul Wallenberg.[1] The song is featured in the 1985 high-school wrestling movie Vision Quest, the Miami Vice episode Smuggler's Blues, and the My Name is Earl episode Bounty Hunter. The beginning of the song is used as a part of a bump for the Cincinnati radio station, WEBN. It is also the inspiration for Kurt Angle's entrance theme in Total Non-Stop Action Wrestling. It is also used as American Mixed Martial Artist Dan Henderson's entrance theme as of late. American guitarist Gary Hoey covered &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; on his 2006 album American Made. The distinctive guitar solo in &quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; was performed by Kenny Greer on a lap steel, also seen in the song's music video.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Lunatic Fringe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n2.\t&quot;Cowboys in Hong Kong (As Far as Siam)&quot; (Cochrane/Greer/Baker) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n3.\t&quot;Only Game in Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n4.\t&quot;Thru the Curtain&quot; (Cochrane/Baker/Jones/Boynton/Greer) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n5.\t&quot;What Have You Got to do (To Get Off Tonight)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n6.\t&quot;Ships&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n7.\t&quot;Caught in the Middle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n8.\t&quot;Don't Let Go of Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n9.\t&quot;Laughing Man&quot; (Cochrane/Jones) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeruda 1983\n\n\nNeruda is the third studio album by the Canadian rock band Red Rider, released in 1983 (see 1983 in music).

It was the band's seventh and final album. The album was recorded with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in Edmonton, Alberta. Following this album, Tom Cochrane pursued a solo career, releasing Mad Mad World in 1991.\n\nThe album was recorded by Biff Dawes and the Westwood One mobile unit over two days and featured on one of the &quot;Westwood One live&quot; concert series shows. Two tracks recorded during these sessions were featured on the Westwood One concert but did not make the final album cut: &quot;Ocean Blues (Emotion Blue)&quot; and &quot;The Untouchable One&quot;. Both songs are from the 1986 self-titled Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider album.\n\nTom Cochrane explained the idea behind the album: &quot;When we put our songs together... Kenny (Greer) has sort of a classical background, as I do... we never had the budget or the means to do it with these kind of players, plus you want to keep it intact as a band, so we've always done it with synthesizers and whatever we had at hand, so it's nice to go in with a real complement of players and have them contribute like they did. In our music, &quot;Lunatic Fringe,&quot; for example, there are parts implied that we thought should be transposed from keyboard to orchestral instruments, and then in other areas we gave George (Blondheim) carte blanche and said, 'Do what you want, add some creative input'. &quot;\nThe concerts were recorded live with a 56-piece orchestra and then mixed down at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n \n1.\t&quot;Light in the Tunnel&quot; (instrumental) - 2:28\n2.\t&quot;Human Race&quot; - 3:48\n3.\t&quot;Can't Turn Back&quot; - 10:22\n4.\t&quot;Napoleon Sheds His Skin&quot; - 6:19\n5.\t&quot;White Hot&quot; (T.

In addition, Cochrane won two SOCAN Awards and an ASCAP Award. Mad Mad World achieved a Diamond sales award in Canada for selling more than 1 million copies in Cochrane's native Canada.\n\nThe album also included the hits &quot;No Regrets&quot; (#3 RPM Canadian Charts), &quot;Sinking Like a Sunset&quot; (#2 RPM Canadian Charts), &quot;Washed Away&quot; (#7 RPM Canadian Charts), &quot;Bigger Man&quot; and the title track &quot;Mad Mad World&quot;.
