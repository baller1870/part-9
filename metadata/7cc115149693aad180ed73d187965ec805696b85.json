As a singer and song writer he was hugely popular with fans &amp; influential among musicians and  vocalists. His recording career bridged three major eras in reggae; from Studio One to Lover's Rock and to the digital age in dancehall. This definitive collection contains 36 essential hits by the legendary singer and includes a live performance DVD recorded in 1986. Hard Time Pressure pays tribute to the life of the reggae icon Lincoln 'Sugar' Minott. \n\n\n\nCD1:\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ My Love Is True\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hard Time Pressure\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ River Jordan\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Never Gonna Give Jah Up\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Good Thing Going\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Never Too Young\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In The Residence\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Babylon\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ No Vacancy\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ghetto-ology\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jah Jah Children\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Man Hungry\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rome\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The People Got To Know\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ghetto Youths\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Loving Jah\n17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Simple As That\n18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Christmas Time\n\nCD2:\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lovers Rock\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sandy\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Show Me That You Love Me Girl\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Lost It\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Penny For My Song\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Now We Know\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ African Girl\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All Kinda People\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Easy Squeeze\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Slice Of The Cake\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Informer\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Feel The Rydim\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Old King Cole\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Buy Off The Bar\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ International Herb\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Herbman Hustling\n17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pickney\n18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rub A Dub Sound\n\n\n\nEnjoyyyyyy and Seed ...............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc115149693aad180ed73d187965ec805696b85","amp;dn":"Sugar+Minott+%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Reggae+Anthology+-+Hard+Time+Pressure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc115149693aad180ed73d187965ec805696b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,193,21,20,150,147,170,209,128,237,115,209,135,150,94,200,5,105,107,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
