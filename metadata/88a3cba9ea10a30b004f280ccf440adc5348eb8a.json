Blast your foes with spells such as Skull Storm, Lightning, and Ectoplasm.\n\nOverview:\n\nWhat a horrible night to have a curse!\n\nSomeone should have warned the Covenant children: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never read aloud strange rituals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Little did they know that their childish game would unleash unspeakable horrors upon the unsuspecting world. Now, many years later, Jeremiah Covenant, the last sane sibling, lies on his deathbed knowing his fragile existence is the only thing restraining the curse. His only hope is Patrick Galloway, a fellow soldier from the Great War and a specialist in abolishing evil abominations.\n\nWelcome to Clive BarkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Undying, a horrifying FPS romp of curses, strange, mad creatures, and family dysfunction gone terribly wrong. Step into the shoes of Patrick Galloway as you attempt to banish the evil using your arcane magic and the ever-dependable six shooter of metal grace.
