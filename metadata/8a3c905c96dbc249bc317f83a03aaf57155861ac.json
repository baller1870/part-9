The majority of these tracks, taken from 14 different albums, are a nice balance between standards including &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; &quot;I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,&quot; and &quot;It Could Happen to You,&quot; and Rollins penned tunes which have since become modern jazz standards, &quot;Oleo,&quot; &quot;Airegin,&quot; and &quot;St. Thomas.&quot; Appearing on these various dates are an extraordinary roster of musicians including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, Kenny Dorham, Horace Silver and Milt Jackson. While there is nothing here the jazz collector doesn't already own, this two disc set provides a decent sampling for the curious listener, along with The Very Best of Sonny Rollins on Blue Note, The Impulse Story and Milestone Profiles. Keep in mind that all the original albums remain in print as well.\r\n\r\n-----Disc 1-----\r\n1. Mambo Bounce\r\n2. In A Sentimental Mood\r\n3. Airegin\r\n4. Doxy\r\n5. Oleo\r\n6. Moving Out\r\n7.
