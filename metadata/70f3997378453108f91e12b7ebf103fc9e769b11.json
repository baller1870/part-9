Many of the tracks on Revolver are marked by an electric guitar-rock sound, in contrast with their previous LP, the folk rock inspired Rubber Soul (1965). In Britain, the fourteen tracks from Revolver were released to radio stations throughout July 1966, &quot;building anticipation for what would clearly be a radical new phase in the group's recording career&quot;.\n\nIt reached number one on both the British chart and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively. The album was remastered 9 September 2009 for the first time since its 1987 digital compact disc release. Placed at number 1 in the All-Time Top 1000 Albums and number 3 in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, the album is often regarded as one of the greatest achievements in music history and one of The Beatles' greatest studio achievements. The CD was remastered in 2009.\n\n2009 STEREO REMASTER [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Taxman&quot; (George Harrison) \tHarrison \t2:39\n02. \t&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:08\n03. \t&quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;   \tLennon \t3:02\n04. \t&quot;Love You To&quot; (Harrison) \tHarrison \t3:01\n05. \t&quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:26\n06. \t&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;   \tStarr \t2:40\n07. \t&quot;She Said She Said&quot;   \tLennon \t2:37\n08. \t&quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:10\n09. \t&quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;   \tLennon \t2:02\n10. \t&quot;For No One&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:01\n11. \t&quot;Doctor Robert&quot;   \tLennon \t2:15\n12. \t&quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; (Harrison) \tHarrison \t2:30\n13. \t&quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:31\n14. \t&quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;   \tLennon \t2:57","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70f3997378453108f91e12b7ebf103fc9e769b11","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Revolver+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70f3997378453108f91e12b7ebf103fc9e769b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,243,153,115,120,69,49,8,249,30,18,183,235,241,3,252,158,118,155,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
