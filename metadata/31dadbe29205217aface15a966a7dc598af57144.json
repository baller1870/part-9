The Bobbsey Twins were the first series under the name, and the others followed. \n\nMany have been re-released over the years, and the Bobbsey Twins in particular were rewritten in the 1960's. The books included here are the original versions with the best covers I could find.\n\nGenre: Childrens Literature\n\nBunny Brown\n01 Bunny Brown And His Sister Sue-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n02 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue on Grandpa's Farm-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue Playing Circus-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue at Camp Rest-A-While-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue at Aunt Lu's City Home-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n06 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue in the Big Woods-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue on an Auto Tour-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n08 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue and Their Shetland Pony-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n09 Bunny Brown and his Sister Sue Giving a Show-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n10 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue at Christmas Tree Cove-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n11 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue in the Sunny South-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n12 Bunny Brown and His Sister Sue Keeping Store-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n\nMake Believe Stories\n02 The Story of a White Rocking Horse-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 The Story of a Lamb on Wheels-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 The Story of a Bold Tin Soldier-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 The Story of a Candy Rabbit-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n06 The Story of a Monkey on a Stick-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 The Story of Calico Clown-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n08 The Story of a China Cat-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n09 The Story of a Nodding Donkey-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n10 The Story of a Plush Bear-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n11 The Story of a Stuffed Elephant-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n\nSix Little Bunkers\n01 Six Little Bunkers at Grandma Bell's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n02 Six Little Bunkers at Aunt Jo's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 Six Little Bunkers at Cousin Tom's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 Six Little Bunkers at Grandpa Ford's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 Six Little Bunkers at Uncle Fred's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 Six Little Bunkers at Cowboy Jack's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n08 Six Little Bunkers at Mammy June's-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n\nThe Bobbsey Twins\n01 The Bobbsey Twins, or Merry Days Indoors and Out-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n02 The Bobbsey Twins in the Country-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 The Bobbsey Twins at the Seashore-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 The Bobbsey Twins at School-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 The Bobbsey Twins at Snow Lodge-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n06 The Bobbsey Twins on a Houseboat-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 The Bobbsey Twins at Meadow Brook-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n08 The Bobbsey Twins at Home-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n09 The Bobbsey Twins in a Great City-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n10 The Bobbsey Twins on Blueberry Island-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n11 The Bobbsey Twins on the Deep Blue Sea-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n12 The Bobbsey Twins in Washington-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n13 The Bobbsey Twins in the Great West-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n14 The Bobbsey Twins at Cedar Camp-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n15 The Bobbsey Twins at the County Fair-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n\nThe Moving Picture Girls\n01 The Moving Picture Girls OR First Appearances in Photo Dramas-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n02 The Moving Picture Girls at Oak Farm-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 The Moving Picture Girls Snowbound-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 The Moving Picture Girls Under the Palms _ Or Lost in the Wilds of Florida-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 The Moving Picture Girls at Rocky Ranch-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n06 The Moving Picture Girls at Sea-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n\nThe Outdoor Girls\n01 The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale _ Or, camping and tramping for fun and health-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n02 The Outdoor Girls at Rainbow Lake _ Or, the stirring cruise of the motor boat Gem-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n03 The Outdoor Girls in a Motor Car-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n04 The Outdoor Girls in a Winter Camp-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n05 The Outdoor Girls in Florida-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n06 The Outdoor Girls at Ocean View-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n07 The Outdoor Girls on Pine Island-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n08 The Outdoor Girls in Army Service _ Or, doing their bit for the soldier boys-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n09 The Outdoor Girls at the Hostess House _ Or, doing their best for the soldiers-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n10 The Outdoor Girls at Bluff Point-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n11 The Outdoor Girls at Wild Rose Lodge _ or, the Hermit of Moonlight Falls-Laura Lee Hope.epub\n12 The Outdoor Girls in the Saddle-Laura Lee Hope.epub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31dadbe29205217aface15a966a7dc598af57144","amp;dn":"64+Novel+Children%27s+Collection+By+Laura+Lee+Hope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31dadbe29205217aface15a966a7dc598af57144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,218,219,226,146,5,33,122,250,206,21,169,102,167,220,89,138,245,113,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
