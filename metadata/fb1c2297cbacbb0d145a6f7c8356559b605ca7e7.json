Now Val must reunite nine-year-old Alex with his estranged father, so they set out on a road trip from New York, Val making appearances at comic book conventions along the way.\r\nAs they travel west, encountering superheroes, monsters, time travelers, and robots, Val and Alex are drawn into the orbit of the comic-con regulars, from a hapless twentysomething illustrator to a lesbian comics writer to a group of cosplay women who provide a chorus of knowing commentary. For Alex, this world is a magical place where fiction becomes reality, but as they get closer to their destination, he begins to realize that the story his mother is telling him about their journey might have a very different ending than he imagined.\r\nA literary-meets-genre pleasure from an exciting new writer, A Hundred Thousand Worlds is a tribute to the fierce and complicated love between a mother and sonâ€”and to the way the stories we create come to shape us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1c2297cbacbb0d145a6f7c8356559b605ca7e7","amp;dn":"A+Hundred+Thousand+Worlds+%28Bob+Proehl%29+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1c2297cbacbb0d145a6f7c8356559b605ca7e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,28,34,151,203,172,187,13,20,90,111,124,131,86,85,155,96,92,167,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
