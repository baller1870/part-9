The original line is probably most famous as being the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first public railway to use steam locomotives when they were first introduced in 1833. \n\nThe area was linked with a prestigious and long list of railway heritage, with several railway-related works and engineering facilities to be found throughout the network. Darlington Railway Works, responsible for the building of many steam and diesel locomotives, was built in 1863 and survived until the Beeching Axe in 1966. Shildon Railway Works, known locally as Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Wagon WorksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as it built many of British RailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freight revenue vehicles, is also a famous landmark in the area, closing only recently in 1984 and now home to Ã¢â‚¬ËœLocomotionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, the National Railway MuseumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second site. \n\nMuch of this extensive railway network and many of those famous landmarks suffered at the hands of Dr Beeching, whose sweeping changes to the British rail network in the 1960s closed many of the branch lines to passenger traffic. As collieries closed and freight traffic reduced, by 1980 there was virtually nothing left of the famous routes as they were once known. \n\nTowns such as Crook, Tow Law, Barnard Castle, Piercebridge and Bishop Auckland Ã¢â‚¬â€œ once bustling railway towns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lost their stations and trackbed lifted, and today visitors to the area would never believe they once had such a rich railway heritage. \n\nThe Weardale and &amp; Teesdale Network faithfully recreates the main lines and branch lines around the area as they were between 1950 and 1960, just before the Beeching closures, recreating almost all of the 100 miles of rail lines between Durham City, Darlington, Middleton-in-Teesdale and Wearhead. \n\nClassic BR green liveried diesel traction is also represented, in the guise of the Class 08, Class 25, Class 37 and Class 101, along with Mk1 blood and custard coaching stock and a number of freight wagons, including a 21t Mineral Hopper, 16t Mineral Wagon, Five Plank Mineral Wagon, Six-Wheel Milk Tanker, Presflo Bulk Powders Wagon, 20t Bitumen Tank Wagon, 20t Toad E Brake Van and 10t Cattle Van. \n\nAlso new for the route is a diesel brake tender Ã¢â‚¬ËœslugÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in BR green livery, alongside prototypical LNER semaphore and colour light signalling throughout the route","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3563f8b35956c9b72df827080f8847c344613ed4","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+Weardale+%26amp%3B+Teesdale+Network+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3563f8b35956c9b72df827080f8847c344613ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,99,248,179,89,86,201,183,45,248,39,8,15,136,71,195,68,97,62,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
