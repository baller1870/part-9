But in fact, both Latin America and Spain are full of MCs who earn a living rapping exclusively in Spanish. The reggaetÃƒÂ³n hybrid (which blends hip-hop, dancehall and Latin rhythms) is huge (especially among Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and Cubans), although there are countless Latino MCs who aren't part of reggaetÃƒÂ³n -- including the Milwaukee-based Mexican group Kinto Sol, whose rapping is strictly en espaÃƒÂ±ol on La Sangre Nunca Muere. Comparable to albums by David Rolas and Jae-P, this 2005 release represents the conscious side of Latin rap. The CD's front cover offers a &quot;parental advisory/explicit content&quot; warning, but don't let that fool you; despite the inclusion of some R-rated lyrics at times, La Sangre Nunca Muere is ultimately a very uplifting rap album -- gritty and hard-hitting, but ultimately uplifting. In Spanish, La Sangre Nunca Muere means &quot;The Bloodline Never Dies,&quot; and the importance of family is a major theme on this CD. Rapping about the social and economic struggles of Mexican immigrants in the United States, Kinto Sol's members stress that that la familia is the backbone of the Mexican community. In fact, Kinto Sol is very much a family affair; three of its members are hermanos (brothers). Tracks like &quot;No Se Puede Comprar&quot; (&quot;You Can't Buy It&quot;), &quot;Esa Es Familia&quot; (&quot;That's Family&quot;) and &quot;Pase lo Que Pase&quot; (&quot;Come What May&quot;) have a very spiritual quality, which isn't to say that Kinto Sol is trying to force religious dogma down anyone's throat; on this CD, family values are promoted in a totally non-sectarian way. Anyone who has appreciated the Spanish-language recordings of David Rolas and Jae-P will also find a lot to admire about La Sangre Nunca Muere\n\n\n\n1. Intro\n2. K-Sol No Juega\n3.
