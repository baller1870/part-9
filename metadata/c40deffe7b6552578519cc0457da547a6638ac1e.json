She's in a hospital... or it may be a police station. She's been traumatized... or possibly she's being held for questioning. She's either the only living witness of a cattle-mutilation style attack on humans, or a multiple killer whose psychotic reaction to heroin led to massacre. Who is this mystery woman? And will her interrogators survive the discovery of her true identity?&quot;\n\nThis is the digital copy by Zone-Empire.
