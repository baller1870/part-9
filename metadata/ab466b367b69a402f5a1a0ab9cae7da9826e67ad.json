The game introduces two thrilling new modes that can be played across four classic Battlefield tropical WWII maps: Wake Island, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Coral Sea. These maps are inspired by the award winning Battlefield 1942 game, but have been redesigned and re-engineered using the DICE destructible Frostbite engine which takes down walls, blockades and cover spots, leaving players with almost nowhere to hide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab466b367b69a402f5a1a0ab9cae7da9826e67ad","amp;dn":"Battlefield+1943+XBLA++arcade+%5BNO+JTAG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab466b367b69a402f5a1a0ab9cae7da9826e67ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,70,107,54,123,105,164,2,245,161,160,171,156,174,125,169,130,110,103,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
