Providing habitat for bees, pollinating your garden, and producing honey for your family are some of the compelling reasons for taking up this exciting hobby. But conventional beekeeping requires a significant investment and has a steep learning curve. The alternative? Consider beekeeping outside the box.\n\nThe Thinking Beekeeper is the definitive do-it-yourself guide to natural beekeeping in top bar hives. Based on the concept of understanding and working with bees' natural systems as opposed to trying to subvert them, the advantages of this approach include:\n\n\nSimplicity, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness\nIncreased safety due to less heavy lifting and hive manipulation\nChemical-free colonies and healthy hives\nTop bar hives can be located anywhere bees have access to forage, and they make ideal urban hives due to their small footprint.\n\nEmphasizing the intimate connection between our food systems, bees, and the well-being of the planet, The Thinking Beekeeper will appeal to the new breed of beekeeper who is less focused on maximizing honey yield, and more on ensuring the viability of the bee population now and in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\nBy Christy Hemenway\nPublished by New Society Publishers in 2013\nTags: nonfiction, bees, honey\nEPUB, Retail, 208 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f539f815f8d98b83b7d639589508925bee695f","amp;dn":"The+Thinking+Beekeeper+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f539f815f8d98b83b7d639589508925bee695f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,245,57,248,21,248,217,139,131,183,214,57,88,149,8,146,91,238,105,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
