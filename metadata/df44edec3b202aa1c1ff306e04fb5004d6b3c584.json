This torrent has NO ARCHIVES and the binaries have their original digital signature.\n\nPlease note that this client is NOT officialy provided by CroggesServer! You should own the original game to support Blizz.\n\n\nHOW TO USE:\n1. Unpack the client\n2. Create an account on http://wow.crogge.com/create (Use a valid e-mail address, it proves your account ownership)\n3. Start the game via LaunchWoW.bat to create a realmlist, the game starts automatically!\n\n\nThis package contains:\n- Full clean 2.4.3 Client\n- Developer maps (No client crashing as on stock client)\n- Batch based launcher V8 (Change realmlist, enable/disable optional functions, reset client, clean cache...)\n- ItemIcon Fix addon so custom items are not shown as question mark anymore\n- Nude patch (Can be disabled in the launcher)\n- Additional ingame music (Only usable on CroggesServer, non-licensed music)\n\n\nFAQ:\nQ: I can't use the LaunchWoW.bat file, how do I create a realmlist.wtf file manually?\nA: Simply rename realmlist.wtf.bak to realmlist.wtf\n\nQ: Can I use this client on any private server?\nA: Yes, you can even set multiple realms in LaunchWoW.bat (Open with notepad or editor of your choice)\n\nQ: Do I have to use LaunchWoW.bat?\nA: No, you can start the game with the WoW.exe. However, the launcher gives additional options and creates the realmlist on first start.\n\nQ: How can I enable/disable auto cache cleaning, nude patch...\nA: Open LaunchWoW.bat and go to &quot;Options&quot; by pressing 5, simply choose what you need.\n\nQ: What does the &quot;RESET client&quot; option?\nA: It basically sets your client to &quot;Factory settings&quot; meaning all cached files/settings/addons will be deleted.\n   Useful if you got any problems, but all your custom settings will be gone! Screenshots are kept.\n\n\nHave fun with TBC!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df44edec3b202aa1c1ff306e04fb5004d6b3c584","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+2.4.3+TBC+Preinstalled","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df44edec3b202aa1c1ff306e04fb5004d6b3c584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,68,237,236,59,32,42,161,193,255,48,110,4,251,80,4,214,179,197,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
