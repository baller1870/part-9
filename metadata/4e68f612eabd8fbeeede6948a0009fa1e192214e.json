A near-limitless array of new sound and texture.\n\nROUND WE GO\n\nROUNDS is a groundbreaking instrument, blurring the lines between cutting-edge sound design and advanced sequencing techniques. Play melodies, chords, and arpeggios while sequencing and morphing your sound palette in real time. An inspiring performance machine of undeniable power and the evolution of software synthesis.\n\nSTART YOUR ENGINES\n\nROUNDS comes with one analog and one digital synth engine. Both give you every essential parameter in a stripped-down, no-fuss layout. Design up to eight sounds per engine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each with its own independent parameter settings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then sequence them with the Voice Programmer.\n\nTHE VOICE PROGRAMMER\n\nThe Voice Programmer gives ROUNDS its magic. It contains eight blocks with four cells each. Each cell hosts one sound. Set these 32 sound slots in motion to create your own rhythmic sound sequence. Five different voicing modes determine the sound distribution on different cells. An additional modifier lets you adjust each voicing mode even further.\n\nEFFECTS\n\nROUNDS has high-quality delay and reverb effects on board. Choose from classic or grain delays, and use the dedicated LFO to create flanging and chorus effects. The reverb is a new algorithm exclusive to ROUNDS. And because the effects are integrated in the synthesizer, you can sequence each effect per sound for bursts of rhythmic echo and space.\n\nSound Categories: Bass, Lead, Pad, Soundscape, SFX, Melodic Sequence, Multitrack Sequence, Arpeggiator Presets (prepared for Komplete Kontrol's onboard Arp).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.ph - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (10).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e68f612eabd8fbeeede6948a0009fa1e192214e","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+-+Rounds+v1.0.0+HYBRID+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e68f612eabd8fbeeede6948a0009fa1e192214e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,104,246,18,234,189,143,190,238,222,105,72,160,0,159,161,225,146,33,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
