Author Janine Warner shows you how to analyze, prioritize, and think strategically about content in many formats (text, images, videos, animations, and infographics) across many channels. In this course, Janine walks you through a series of decisions to transform an outdated, content-heavy website into a multifaceted, multimedia showcase that includes a blog, email newsletter, and social media profiles. Along the way, explore key content strategy documents and tools, including how to create a content inventory, gap analysis, and content matrix. The course also explains how content strategy often overlaps with information architecture, and how constantly testing your theories is the key to long-term success.\nTopics include:\n\nWhat is content strategy?\nSetting clear goals and managing expectations\nCreating a content inventory\nIdentifying content needs with a gap analysis\nManaging development with a content matrix\nCreating a style guide and editorial calendar\nDeveloping wireframes and sitemaps\nChoosing the best medium for your message\nTesting and gathering feedback from users","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96e441cd27431f50346e005da91ba3634739c55","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Creating+an+Effective+Content+Strategy+for+Your+Webs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96e441cd27431f50346e005da91ba3634739c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,110,68,28,210,116,49,245,3,70,224,5,218,145,186,54,52,115,156,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
