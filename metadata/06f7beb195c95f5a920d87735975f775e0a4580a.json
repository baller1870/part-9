The diversity is quite obvious on the WOW Gospel 2001 collection, a 32-track spiritual pick-me-up bound to find favor with most listeners. &quot;Let's Dance,&quot; one of the release's hotter grooves, shows this well when the more traditional (Hezekiah Walker &amp; the Love Fellowship Crusade Choir) meets the not-so-traditional (rapper B.B. Jay). Or check out the blistering soul and hard-driving bass lines of John P. Kee and the New Life Community Choir on &quot;Right Here.&quot; Of course no gospel collection is complete without a Yolanda Adams ballad (&quot;Still I Rise&quot;) and a CeCe Winans tune (&quot;Alabaster Box&quot;). Disc one holds surprises such as ol' Doobie Brother Michael McDonald on Darwin Hobbs's &quot;Everyday.&quot; The second disc focuses more on traditional gospel instead of crisp urban pop. You'll have a hard time not raising your hands to the soaring choruses of &quot;Battlefield&quot; by Norman Hutchins. And Aaron Neville brings forth &quot;Mary Don't You Weep&quot; in the classic spiritual style of gospel. Altogether, this collection testifies to the great and varied sounds in today's gospel music scene.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, June 2009\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06f7beb195c95f5a920d87735975f775e0a4580a","amp;dn":"WoW+Gospel+-+2001+-+WoW+Gospel+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06f7beb195c95f5a920d87735975f775e0a4580a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,247,190,177,149,201,95,90,146,13,135,115,89,117,247,117,224,164,88,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
