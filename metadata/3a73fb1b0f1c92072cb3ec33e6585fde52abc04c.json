What makes PortraitureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masking tool truly unique is its built-in Auto-Mask feature. It helps you quickly discover most of the skin tone range of the image automatically and, if preferred, you can manually fine-tune it to ensure optimal results, providing unmatched precision and productivity.\n\n For finer control, you can specify the smoothening degree for different detail sizes and adjust the sharpness, softness, warmth, brightness and contrast.\n\n Portraiture comes with pre-defined presets for one-click effects and, as with all Imagenomic plugins, you can capture your own signature workflow in a custom preset tailored to your specific requirements and photographic portfolio.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/97434323199578742277.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/97434323199578742277.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/82818572316685408974.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/82818572316685408974.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- Portraiture\n\nBring out the Best in Your Portraits\n\n Portraiture is a Photoshop, Lightroom and Aperture plugin that eliminates the tedious manual labor of selective masking and pixel-by-pixel treatments to help you achieve excellence in portrait retouching.

You can also capture your own signature workflow through custom presets tailored to your specific requirements and individual photographs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/43129088814423737937.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/43129088814423737937.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/02677831611921153001.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/02677831611921153001.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a73fb1b0f1c92072cb3ec33e6585fde52abc04c","amp;dn":"Imagenomic+Adobe+Plugins+%5BENG%5D%5BSerial%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a73fb1b0f1c92072cb3ec33e6585fde52abc04c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,115,251,27,15,28,146,7,44,179,236,51,230,88,95,222,82,171,192,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
