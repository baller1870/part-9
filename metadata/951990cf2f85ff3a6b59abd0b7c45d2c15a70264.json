Spivey, 55 at the time, is also heard playing piano, and she takes four of the ten selections as solo performances. All of the compositions are hers, including &quot;Christmas Without Santa Claus,&quot; &quot;I'm a Red Hot Mama,&quot; &quot;Grow Old Together&quot; and &quot;I Got Men All Over This Town.&quot; Recommended as a strong example of Victoria Spivey's later work.
