London is post-World War II, but pre-\nBeatles and the Stones. The storyline incorporates elements of 1958 London \nracial riots.\n\nYoung hip photographer Colin falls in love with aspiring fashion designer Crepe \nSuzette, but she's only interested in her career. Colin tries to win her \naffections by taking a crack at the big time himself; meanwhile racial tensions \nheat up in Colin's neighbourhood of London.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMain CAST\n\nPatsy Kensit            - Suzette\nEddie O'Connell         - Colin, Photographer / Narrator\nDavid Bowie             - Vendice Partners\nJames Fox               - Henley of Mayfair, Dressmaker to the Queen\nRay Davies              - Arthur, Colin's Dad\nMandy Rice-Davies       - Flora\nEve Ferret              - Big Jill\nTony Hippolyte          - Mr. Cool\nGraham Fletcher-Cook    - Wizard\nJoe McKenna             - Fabulous Hoplite\nSteven Berkoff          - The Fanatic\nSade                    - Athene Duncannon (as Sade Adu)\nEdward Tudor-Pole       - Ed the Ted (as Tenpole Tudor)\nBruce Payne             - Flikker\nAlan Freeman            - Call-Me-Cobber\n\n\nMain CREW\n\nJulien Temple           - Director / Songwriter\nChris Brown             - Producer\nStephen Woolley         - Producer\nRichard Burridge        - Screenwriter\nColin MacInnes          - Book Author\nDon MacPherson          - Screenwriter\nChristopher Wicking     - Screenwriter\nOliver Stapleton        - Cinematographer\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview by VARIETY STAFF\n\nAbsolute Beginners is a terrifically inventive original musical for the screen. \nDaring attempt to portray the birth of teenagedom in London, 1958, almost \nexclusively through song is based upon Colin MacInnes' cult novel about teen \nlife and pop fashion in the percolating moments just before the youth cultural \nexplosion in the early 1960s.\n\nTenuous storyline is a typical one of teen love achieved, lost and regained, and \nis used as a mere string to which a constant parade of musical numbers and \nflights of fancy are attached.\n\nAspiring photographer Colin (Eddie O'Connell) and tyro fashion designer Suzette \n(Patsy Kensit) seem a perfect match, but when the latter begins getting ahead \nand becomes engaged to a snooty couturier played by James Fox, Colin decides to \nsell out and make the most of his connections in a last-ditch effort to win back \nhis lady love.\n\nIn creating a stylized view of 1950s culture, director Julien Temple and lenser \nOliver Stapleton have made great use of fabulous sets fashioned by production \ndesigner John Beard. An astonishing moving camera take throughout the Soho set \nin the early going represents a fully worthy homage to the opening shot of Orson \nWelles' Touch of Evil.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMediaInfo:\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.30 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 733 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-02-03 23:58:45\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v2.2.0 ('Turn It On Again') built on \nMar  4 2008 12:58:26\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;

But \nMacInnes' fictional mods certainly appreciated style, and the soundtrack to the \nfilm adaptation of his classic novel was, first and foremost, a stunningly cool \nshowcase for the jazz currents that flowed freely through the U.K. pop scene in \nthe mid-'80s, via artists like Sade, Working Week, Eighth Wonder (featuring \nPatsy Kensit, who also starred in the film as Crepe Suzette), and of, course, \nPaul Weller's Style Council. (Weller, according to legend, turned down the \nchance to play Swift; he'd already used the title of MacInnes' book for one of \nhis last hits with the Jam.) The remainder of the collection, meanwhile, is \nperfectly complementary, instead of odds and sods. The two numbers with the \nstrongest connections to the music of MacInnes' era are both delights; Slim \nGaillard's &quot;Selling Out&quot; reprises the hipster jive of his '50s hits, and Ray \nDavies recommends the &quot;Quiet Life&quot; over a charming trad jazz arrangement. A pair \nof instrumentals contributed by legendary arranger Gil Evans and ex-Specials \nleader Jerry Dammers are also memorable -- Evans' playful &quot;Va Va Voom&quot; morphs \nfrom straight-up swing to Afro-Cuban sass with ease, while &quot;Riot City&quot; sounds \nlike the jazz counterpart to the Specials' spooky ska smash, &quot;Ghost Town.&quot; And \nthe coup de grÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ce comes from a first-generation mod: David Bowie's title track \nis the gem of his post-&quot;Let's Dance&quot; '80s output, a big, breathtaking ballad \nallowing him to indulge the Sinatra croon that's driven many of his best \nperformances. Whatever Absolute Beginners lacks in historical accuracy, it makes \nup for with great songs and savoir faire, and it stands as one of the finest \nsoundtracks from a decade filled with good ones. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview on the &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; track, by Dave Thompson\n\nOne of the finest of all David Bowie's 1980s compositions -- indeed, one of his \nbest songs of all time -- &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; was written and recorded for the \nsoundtrack of director Julien Temple's equally brilliant movie of the same name.\n\nRecorded with session men borrowed from Thomas Dolby's latest sessions, plus \nHunky Dory veteran Rick Wakeman on piano, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; was produced by \nAlan Winstanley and Clive Langer. The song's arrangement owes much to the late\n-'50s doo wop sound of the movie's own time frame, but is underpinned by some of \nBowie's best-ever sax playing and one of his most emotional lyrical and vocal \nperformances. An instant U.K. hit (a far cry from the sad fate of the film), a \n7&quot; edit of the song soared to number two -- the full version was issued on 12&quot;, \nwhile two further edits were included on the official movie soundtrack.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe rip has been done using EAC to extract a .wav file, and dBPowerAmp to convert\nthat into a Level-8 FLAC file. Log files are enclosed.\n\nThe CD is presented as ONE SINGLE LONG AUDIO FILE. There's also a .cue file \nwhich marks the track points. If you need to extract a single song from this, \nyou must download the whole album, and use a tool like Medieval Cue Splitter for \nWindows, or X Lossless Decoder (XLD) for Mac Users. Under Linux the ripping \nsoftware &quot;abcde&quot; (A better CD encoder) can split CUE/FLAC files.\n\nAlso, you can use Burrrn (on Windows) to burn it directly to a CD, where the\ntracks will be seperated.\n\nAttention: Single .cue/FLAC files. That's simply my personal choice for\nreleasing it, don't argue about it, thanks. IF you don't like it, you've been\nclearly told, so look somewehere else and don't come crying. It's free, ok? Take\nit as it comes.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db53a98282d5986f9f706e296c682b12ecda7072","amp;dn":"Absolute+Beginners+%28Julien+Temple%2C+1986%29+%5BRePoPo%5D+%28Movie+%26+OST+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db53a98282d5986f9f706e296c682b12ecda7072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,83,169,130,130,213,152,111,159,112,110,41,108,104,43,18,236,218,112,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
