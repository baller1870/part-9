Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman) are buddies who enjoy smoking voluminous amounts of the illegal plant. They end up in the possession of some magical weed that enhances their brainpower during college entrance exams, thus enabling them to enter that esteemed institution of learning, Harvard University. Once firmly ensconced in the halls of academia, however, the pals run out of their supernatural supply and are forced to get creative in the pursuit of an Ivy League degree. Included in their narcotic-addled plans: smoking the bones of dead president John Quincy Adams. Produced by Danny DeVito's Jersey Films, How High (2001) co-stars Obba Babatunde, Fred Willard, and Hector Elizondo. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 34 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c2a4f7b597362ef976a7e467924645361458f7","amp;dn":"How+High%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c2a4f7b597362ef976a7e467924645361458f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,194,164,247,181,151,54,46,249,118,167,228,103,146,70,69,54,20,88,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
