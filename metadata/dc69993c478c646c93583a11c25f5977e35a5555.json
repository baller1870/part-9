For more on Fishbone they're on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbone\n\nAgain another funky band that I'm uploading. I've included all their albums really, this is pretty much all their stuff. Once you've got all these you won't be missing much. They all sound superb, all matching MP3 @ 320kbps CBR, 44.1Khz. Same as my other discographies really. I've tagged them all properly, album artwork included also with what is available.\n\nI hope this is the best discography that can be made for Fishbone, they're a good band and have a funny sound. It was good to include a few EPs with this also which contain extra tracks you don't find on the albums.\n\nPlease help me to keep this seeded...\n\nI hope that people out there are enjoying my torrents, I want to make sure that these collections I'm making are sorted out good and proper so when you download it you don't have to mess with them, they're already fixed up so you can just listen and enjoy the music!\n\nReleases as follows:\n\n(1986) Fishbone - In Your Face\n(1988) Fishbone - Truth And Soul\n(1991) Fishbone - The Reality Of My Surroundings\n(1993) Fishbone - Give A Monkey A Brain And He'll Swear He's The Center Of The Universe\n(1996) Fishbone - Chim Chim's Badass Revenge\n(2000) Fishbone - The Psychotic Friends Nuttwerx\n(2006) Fishbone - Still Stuck In Your Throat\n(1996) Fishbone - Fishbone 101: Nuttasaurusmeg Fossil Fuelin' The Fonkay  CD 1\n(1996) Fishbone - Fishbone 101: Nuttasaurusmeg Fossil Fuelin' The Fonkay  CD 2\n(2003) Fishbone - The Essential Fishbone\n(1985) Fishbone - Fishbone\n(1987) Fishbone - It's A Wonderful Life (Gonna Have A Good Time)\n(1990) Fishbone - Bonin' In The Boneyard\n(2002) Fishbone - The Friendliest Psychosis Of All\n(2011) Fishbone - Crazy Glue\n(2002) Fishbone - Live At The Temple Bar And More\n(2005) Fishbone - Live In Amsterdam","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc69993c478c646c93583a11c25f5977e35a5555","amp;dn":"Fishbone+-+The+Complete+Discography+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc69993c478c646c93583a11c25f5977e35a5555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,105,153,60,71,140,100,108,147,88,58,17,194,95,89,119,227,90,85,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
