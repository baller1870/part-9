This rip is a transfer from the digitally remastered widescreen laserdisc.  The film was shot in a very wide aspect ratio (2.40:1?) so this widescreen transfer is a million times better than all other video releases--there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s almost 50% more image presented.  The laserdisc is also the only time the complete uncut version of the film has been released: this version includes the post-end credit exit music.  \n\nThis rip is taken directly from the laserdisc using a Panasonic DVD recorder.  There are random chapters that were put in by the recorder.  Sorry....no fancy menus or artwork.  The short pause at 57:04 is the side change, not a DVD error.
