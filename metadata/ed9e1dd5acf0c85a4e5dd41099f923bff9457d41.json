This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\n\nSTEALTH\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\n\nLOAD-OUTS &amp; GEAR\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\n\n### IMPORTANT ### Game requires OpenGL ES 3.0 support.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Tactical top-down shooter\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Episodic storyline in three chapters - chapter ONE and TWO out now!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gorgeous stylistic HD graphics\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wide range of weapons and gear\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Performance based mission rewards\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Multiple factions to fight with or against Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or pitch against each other\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dual stick controls with a set of different options\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gamepad controller support\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Google Play achievements &amp; leaderboards\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Optimized for NVIDIA Shield Tablet and Console\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Removed unused BILLING permission.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.sg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixelbite.sg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Copy 'com.pixelbite.sg' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\n2.Install APK\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed9e1dd5acf0c85a4e5dd41099f923bff9457d41","amp;dn":"Space+Marshals+v1.1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed9e1dd5acf0c85a4e5dd41099f923bff9457d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,158,29,213,172,240,200,90,78,93,212,16,153,249,35,191,249,69,125,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
