His autobiography, Histoire de ma vie (Story of My Life), is regarded as one of the most authentic sources of the customs and norms of European social life during the 18th century.\nHe was so famous as a womanizer that his name remains synonymous with the art of seduction. He associated with European royalty, popes and cardinals, along with luminaries such as Voltaire, Goethe and Mozart. He spent his last years in Bohemia as a librarian in Count Waldstein's household, where he also wrote the story of his life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816ab1cb4e9e92ed8c1908c6b017f5ffb5cb94ea","amp;dn":"e+Complete+Memoirs+of+Jacques+Casanova+de+Seingalt+by+Giacomo+Ca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816ab1cb4e9e92ed8c1908c6b017f5ffb5cb94ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,106,177,203,78,158,146,237,140,25,8,198,176,23,245,255,181,203,148,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
