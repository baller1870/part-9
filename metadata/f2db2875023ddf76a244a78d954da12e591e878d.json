Midway through the meal, Carlos disappears. An experienced, semi-retired inspector takes the case, but what should be a routine investigation becomes something strange, intangible, even sinister. The corporation for which Carlos worked seems to serve no purpose; the staff talk of their missing colleagueâ€™s alarming, shifting physical symptoms; a forensic scientist uncovers evidence of curious abnormalities in the thriving ecosystem of cells and bacteria that made up Carlosâ€™s body. As the inspector relives and retraces the missing manâ€™s footsteps, the trail leads him deep into the countryâ€™s rainforest interior, where he encounters both horror and wonder.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2db2875023ddf76a244a78d954da12e591e878d","amp;dn":"Infinite+Ground+-+Martin+MacInnes+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2db2875023ddf76a244a78d954da12e591e878d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,219,40,117,2,61,223,118,162,68,167,141,149,77,161,46,89,30,135,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
