But when Penn arrives, Tom denies ever making the requestÃ¢â‚¬â€keeping his secrets for another day.\n\nThe emergency hurls Penn back to a chilling case in Houston, where he worked in a DAs office known as the &quot;death factory,&quot; which sent more killers to death row than any other in America. While Penn cares for his ailing wife, a tormented forensic technician brings him evidence of a crime lab in chaos, throwing past convictions into doubt and begging Penn to prevent an imminent travesty of justice. With the desperation of a man fighting death in his own home, Penn must find a way to bring the machinery of the death factory to a halt.\n\nIncluded here is an extended sneak preview of Natchez Burning, the first installment in an epic trilogy featuring Penn Cage.
