When Ken and Lorna collect their daughter from the airport, they're horrified to learn that she's returned from her gap year with more than just a henna tattoo and braids in her hair.\n\n At the arrival gate, she promptly introduces them to her new husband, Cuckoo - the squared-jawed, self-appointed spiritual ninja who is now their son-in-law. Cuckoo is every parent's worst nightmare - a slacker full of outlandish, New Age ideas.\n\n Ken and Lorna have no choice but to welcome him into their family home - and if every Englishman's home is his castle, then this hippie has stormed Ken's fortress and plundered everything, most unforgivably, his princess.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cuckoo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cuckoo/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 29mn 14s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 568 Kbps\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 29mn 14s\nBit rate                                 : 1 673 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc6e4be3c76ad04559c93c1089abef17ef6f648","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Cuckoo+-+S01+-+Sitcom+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc6e4be3c76ad04559c93c1089abef17ef6f648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,198,228,190,60,118,173,4,85,156,147,193,8,154,190,241,126,246,246,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
