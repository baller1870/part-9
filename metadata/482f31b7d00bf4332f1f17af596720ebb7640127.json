Anonymous hotel rooms are all the home he knows. Tae-jun is a motorbike courier who spends almost all his time on the streets. Two men with two jobs that keep them on the move. Two lives that are just a series of fleeting moments. Having clicked on the internet they arrange to meet in Seoul. But they only have a few hours. Won-gyu never wanted to return to the city because Seoul reminds him of an event that has left him sad and angry. His past casts a long shadow over their date, and their night together is pitch-black in spite of the big city lights. Since they must soon part again, both are afraid to get too close and a strange power game begins. Tae-jun joins his new friend as he sets out in search of something. They go to a place that was once the site of a brutal attack on gays. \n\n\n01:15:12\n640x360\n23.976 FPS\n\n\nNO English sub. \nSomeone should make one!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482f31b7d00bf4332f1f17af596720ebb7640127","amp;dn":"e+2012+Baek+Ya+%5BWhite+Night%5D+%28KOR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482f31b7d00bf4332f1f17af596720ebb7640127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,47,49,183,208,11,244,51,47,31,23,175,89,103,32,235,183,100,1,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
