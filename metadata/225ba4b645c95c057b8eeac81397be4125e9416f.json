One of the funniest and most poignant books ever written about a mental illness, Agorafabulous! is a hilarious, raw, and unforgettable account of how a terrified young woman, literally trapped by her own imagination, evolved into a (relatively) high-functioning professional smartass. Down to earth and seriously funny, BenincasaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no-holds-barred revelations offer readers the politically incorrect hilarity they heartily crave, yet is so often missing from your typical, weepy, and redemptive personal memoir. \n\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n===================\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I subscribe to the notion that if you can laugh at the shittiest moments in your life,you can transcend them. And if other people can laugh at your awful shit as well, then I guess you can officially call yourself a comedian.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn Boston, a college student fears leaving her own roomÃ¢â‚¬â€even to use the toilet. In Pennsylvania, a meek personal assistant finally confronts a perpetually enraged gay spiritual guru. In Texas, a rookie high school teacher deals with her male studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusually, er, hard personal problem. Sara Benincasa has been that terrified student, that embattled employee, that confused teacherÃ¢â‚¬â€and so much more. Her hilarious memoir chronicles her attempts to forge a wonderfully weird adulthood in the midst of her lifelong struggle with agoraphobia, depression, and unruly hair. \n\nRelatable, unpretentious, and unsentimental, Agorafabulous! celebrates eccentricity, resilience, and the power of humor to light up even the darkest corners of our lives. (There are also some sexy parts, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really awkward. Like really, really awkward.) \n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nSara Benincasa is a comedian, writer, and speaker on mental health awareness. One of the Huffington Post's &quot;favorite female comedians,&quot; Paste magazine's Best Twitter Users of 2010, Venus Zine's Top 5 Funny Ladies to Follow on Twitter, and The Frisky's Top 15 Up and Coming Lady Comics, Sara has appeared on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, CBS's Early Show, NBC's Today Show, RT TV's The Alyona Show, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), and Japan's TV Asahi. She's from the Dirty Jerz.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:225ba4b645c95c057b8eeac81397be4125e9416f","amp;dn":"Sara+Benincasa+-+Agorafabulous%21%3A+Dispatches+from+My+Bedroom+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"225ba4b645c95c057b8eeac81397be4125e9416f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,91,164,182,69,201,92,5,123,142,234,200,19,151,190,65,37,233,65,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
