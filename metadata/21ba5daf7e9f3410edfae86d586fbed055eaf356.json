Drawing upon a treasure trove of diaries, letters, newspaper articles, and government documents, Levine offers a unique perspective on the old South's demise through the voices of those who lived through the conflict.\n\nIn 1860 the American South was a vast, wealthy, imposing region where a small minority had amassed great political power and enormous fortunes through a system of forced labor. The South?s large population of slaveless whites almost universally supported the basic interests of plantation owners, despite the huge wealth gap that separated them. \n\nBy the end of 1865 these structures of wealth and power had been shattered. Millions of black people had gained their freedom, many poorer whites had ceased following their wealthy neighbors, and plantation owners were brought to their knees, losing not only their slaves but their political power, their worldview, their very way of life. This sea change was felt nationwide, as the balance of power in Congress, the judiciary, and the presidency shifted dramatically and lastingly toward the North, and the country embarked on a course toward equal rights.\n\nBrilliantly argued and engrossing, The Fall of the House of Dixie is a sweeping account of the destruction of the old South during the Civil War, offering a fresh perspective on the most colossal struggle in our history and the new world it brought into being.\n\nAuthor:\n\nBruce Levine writes predominantly about the US Civil War and Us in the 1800s. His previous books include: Confederate Emancipation: Southern Plans to Free and Arm Slaves during the Civil War. Half Slave &amp; Half Free: The Roots of Civil War. The Spirit of 1848: German Immigrants, Labor Conflict, and the Coming of the Civil War and Who Built America? Working People and the Nation's Economy, Politics, Culture &amp; Society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ba5daf7e9f3410edfae86d586fbed055eaf356","amp;dn":"The+Fall+Of+The+House+Of+Dixie+-+The+Civil+War+And+The+Social+Re","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ba5daf7e9f3410edfae86d586fbed055eaf356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,186,93,175,126,159,52,16,237,250,232,109,88,111,190,208,85,234,243,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
