Pryma\nOxford University Press | December 2014 | ISBN-10: 0199918031 | True PDF | 208 pages | 26.1 mb\n\nIn contrast to most anatomic radiographic imaging techniques, nuclear medicine permits real time, non-invasive imaging of human physiology and pathophysiology and also allows for exquisite targeting of disease with therapeutic radiology. To open this window to the processes of human disease, one must first understand the physical processes behind radioactive decay and emission, as well the principles of radiation detection. Practical Nuclear Medicine Physics provides residents and practitioners in nuclear medicine and radiology a readable explanation of the physics concepts underpinning nuclear imaging and how they impact the utilization and interpretation of those images. Following a brief introductory section, the book provides numerous case examples, illustrating various imaging artifacts and pitfalls that can be recognized and remedied with a solid understanding of the physics behind the procedure. Understanding and applying the physics behind nuclear medicine is essential to maximizing not only diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy for providing optimal patient care, but &quot;Practical Physics&quot; is a required portion of radiology residency education and a designated area of the board exams.\n\nAbout the Author\nAssistant Professor of Radiology; Modality Chief, Nuclear Medicine/Molecular Imaging, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface xi\n1 INTRODUCTION TO NUCLEAR MEDICINE 1\n2 RADIATION 5\n3 RADIOBIOLOGY 15\n4 RADIATION DETECTORSÃ¢â‚¬â€IONIZATION DETECTORS 23\n5 RADIATION DETECTORSÃ¢â‚¬â€SINGLE PHOTON 31\n6 RADIATION DETECTIONÃ¢â‚¬â€PET 55\n7 IONIZATION CHAMBER/DOSE CALIBRATOR ARTIFACTS 67\n8 GAMMA CAMERA ARTIFACTS 73\n9 PLANAR ACQUISITION ARTIFACTS 83\n10 SPECT ACQUISITION ARTIFACTS 95\n11 PET ACQUISITION ARTIFACTS 109\n12 DOSE CALIBRATOR PITFALLS 123\n13 SINGLE PHOTON PITFALLS 129\n14 PET PITFALLS 145\n15 THERAPY PITFALLS 157\n16 PUZZLERS 167\nAnswers 178\nIndex 181","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e6dbe38169aa1a9f44121a6086d77fe71c62a7","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Medicine+-+Practical+Physics%2C+Artifacts%2C+and+Pitfalls+%28g","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e6dbe38169aa1a9f44121a6086d77fe71c62a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,230,219,227,129,105,170,26,159,68,18,26,96,134,215,127,231,28,98,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
