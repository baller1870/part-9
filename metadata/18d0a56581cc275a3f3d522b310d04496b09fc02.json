So here there are only a few words about Art Tatum:\n\nWith an exuberant style that combined dazzling technique and sophisticated use of harmony, Art Tatum is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time.Critic Scott Yanow wrote &quot;Tatum's quick reflexes and boundless imagination kept his improvisations filled with fresh (and sometimes futuristic) ideas that put him way ahead of his contemporaries ... Art Tatum's recordings still have the ability to scare modern pianists.&quot;\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
