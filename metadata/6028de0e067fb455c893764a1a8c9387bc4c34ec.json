The compilation contains edited 12-inch single versions of tracks by artists like Cyrus, Phylyps, Quadrant, Octagon, Radiance, and Q 1.1. \n5/5\n\n-Steve Huey, Allmusic\n\n\n[BCD-2]\n(no review)\n5/5 \n\n-Anonymous, Allmusic\n\n\n[Arrange and Process Basic Channel Tracks]\nOver the course of an hour, Scion arrange the timeless Basic Channel  catalog into a multi-layered mix that reaches staggering heights of intensity. Scion, a duo comprised of Chain Reaction recording artists Rene Lowe (Vainqueur) and Peter Kuschnereit (Substance), mix the tracks with Ableton\\\\\\'s Live audio software. With this software, they are able to layer and manipulate the tracks in ways impossible with only turntables. Even those of you who know these tracks inside out will marvel at what Scion do here. In many instances, the duo makes these decade-old tracks sound new. Once the mix begins to gain steam ten minutes in, when Scion work Quadrant\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Infinition\\\\\\&quot; into the mix followed by \\\\\\&quot;Octaedre\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Octagon,\\\\\\&quot; it becomes very apparent -- yes, these guys want to make these tracks sound new again, but they\\\\\\'re not going to forsake the essence of what makes Basic Channel  one of the most recognizable catalogs of techno ever. For the next 30 minutes or so, the mix moves briskly through the more maddening and aggressive Basic Channel tracks, including the album\\\\\\'s dizzying climax, Cyrus\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;Enforcement.\\\\\\&quot; Scion certainly deserve credit for reviving these classics with the latest software capabilities. No one will argue otherwise. Plus, the duo sequences the catalog brilliantly, mixing in a new track every two or three minutes. Much of what makes this mix so powerful, though, is the tracks themselves. Even without the audio software, the Basic Channel  catalog sounds startlingly innovative, and not just for the early \\\\\\'90s, when they were originally released, but also for 2002, when Tresor and Scion decided to revive them in the grandest possible fashion. \n4.5/5\n\n-Jason Birchmeier, Allmusic\n\n[M-Series]\nConcentrating on volumes four through seven in the M Records series, Maurizio  collects edits of seven tracks, adding one original 12\\\\\\&quot; mix and one unreleased mix. Each of the nine tracks layer heavy dub effects and synthwork over midtempo house rhythms with plenty of echo and reverb. Besides its necessity for collectors due to the unreleased track, the disc is also the best place to start for those unable or unwilling to use a turntable. Given the fact that the originals are so long and basically unchanging, the edits occasionally work better than the originals, although they aren\\\\\\'t the versions that a vinyl-phile like Maurizio necessarily wanted listeners to hear. \n4.5/5\n\n-John Bush, Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6028de0e067fb455c893764a1a8c9387bc4c34ec","amp;dn":"Basic+Channel+-+BCD+1%262+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6028de0e067fb455c893764a1a8c9387bc4c34ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,40,222,14,6,127,180,85,200,147,118,74,26,140,147,135,188,76,52,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
