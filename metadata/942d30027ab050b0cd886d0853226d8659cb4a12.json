It entertains as it informs, describing how to maximize a survival mind-set necessary for self-reliance. According to the book, living through an emergency scenario is 90 percent psychology, and 10 percent methodology and gear. Relevant quotes and tips are placed throughout the pages to help readers remember important survival strategies while under stress and anxiety. Lundin also addresses basic first aid and hygiene skills and makes recommendations for survival kit items for the home, office, and car.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:942d30027ab050b0cd886d0853226d8659cb4a12","amp;dn":"When+All+Hell+Breaks+Loose+-+Cody+Lundin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"942d30027ab050b0cd886d0853226d8659cb4a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,45,48,2,122,176,80,176,205,136,109,8,83,34,109,134,89,203,74,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
