It has often been said that a single album, with the best of both volumes, would have been better than two separate albums. Although this is the general consensus among Joe Public, the hard-core Guns N' Roses fans know better. \n\nIn my opinion, the Illusion albums have very little filler. It would also be hard to have a single album with songs from each disc, as each Illusion album is its own entity. The Illusion set is not a single album with two separate discs. Both volumes are albums in their own right, with a different tone, vibe, and feeling. The colors on the album covers represent the atmosphere of the albums. &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; is brighter, more up-beat, glossier. &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; is more reflective, and overall darker. \n\nBetween both volumes, there is over two and a half hours of music. Both volumes need to be nursed and savored. The listener needs time to let it all sink in. Some of these songs are fast paced rockers in the vein of &quot;Appetite For Destruction.&quot; Other songs are longer, up to ten minutes in length, with intricate solos and complex arrangements, in short, art-rock. \n\nWith an album like &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot; under their belt, any follow-up would be criticized. But much had changed for GN'R since they hit it big. They were now multi-millionaires and no longer living in poverty in cheap apartments in L.A. Also, the lineup of the band had changed. Drummer Steven Adler was fired, and replaced by Matt Sorum. Sorum's drumming was slicker, more technically proficient. Also added to the lineup was keyboardist Dizzy Reed. The new GN'R was more polished, less rough-around-the-edges than they had been in the days of AFD. \n\nGN'R branched out artistically for their follow-up, and naturally received a lot of criticism. Common complaints are--the band went soft, too much filler, to arty, etc. \n\nTo address these criticisms: (1) The band did not go soft. There are ballads, but there are also a lot of rockers. A lot of the singles were the ballads, so someone unfamiliar with these albums might conclude that the band went soft by listening to the radio/MTV and conclude that these songs (Don't Cry, November Rain) represent the album, when in fact, they do not. (2) As for there being too much filler, that is a matter of opinion. I happen to think that each song ranges from very good-to classic. A lot of GN'R's very best songs are buried in the set. Because there is so much music, a lot of the songs remain unknown to the general public and are therefore considered &quot;filler.&quot; (3)A lot of these songs are art-rock. They are often long in length and are not instantly assessable-and are therefore dismissed. A lot of these songs are quite intricate and take time to fully appreciate. \n\n&quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; has a very glossy feel. It is somewhat overproduced, but for me, as someone who has been listening to it for almost 15 years, that's just part of the album's charm. I tend to look at the first volume as &quot;the Izzy album,&quot; and the second volume as &quot;the Axl album.&quot; I do this because Izzy's signature Stones/Faces influence is more prevalent on volume I, and Axl's artistic muscle is stretched more on the second volume, although there is an overlap and each made great contributions to the other. \n\nSorum and bassist Duff McKagan provide a killer rhythm section. Slash's playing, of course, goes without saying, is absolutely incredible. Each song has at least one or two screeching, ear-crunching, kick-ass, yet melodic solos. And Axl Rose shows why he is one of the most memorable, charismatic figures in rock. And some of Izzy Stradlin's best songs are found on &quot;Use Your Illusion I.&quot; \n\nThe first volume starts out rocking hard with the AFD style &quot;Right Next Door to Hell.&quot; This song doesn't have quite the furry of AFD, but it's still a good song nonetheless and a good way to start off the album. Izzy Stradlin's mid-tempo &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot; is a very Stones-ey song and is quite underrated. Slash's solo in it absolutely rips. Paul McCartney's &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; is a very cool cover and stays pretty true to the original, while giving it a little more of an edge. &quot;Don't Cry,&quot; the first song ever written in Guns N' Roses, is a beautiful balled, although the 30 second ending is a bit over-the-top. &quot;Perfect Crime&quot; is another great rocker, in the vein of AFD, and is another highly underrated song. Izzy Stradlin's sleepy, &quot;You Ain't the First&quot; is the only song I would consider to be filler. It's not bad, but it just slows down the momentum a bit. The rock-a-billy &quot;Bad Obsession&quot; is GN'R paying homage to Southern Rock. &quot;Back off Bitch&quot; musically is excellent, although the lyrics are stupid and juvenile, and didn't help GN'R's image as being misogynist. Stradlin's fast paced &quot;Double Talkin' Jive&quot; has a catchy, almost sinister riff and features one of Slash's best solos. Rose's Elton John inspired masterpiece &quot;November Rain&quot; follows next. This remains one of GN'R's most beloved songs to date. \n\nA lot of Guns N' Roses best songs are found on the second half of &quot;Use Your Illusion I.&quot; Unfortunately, because of the album's length, they just sort of got buried. &quot;The Garden&quot; is a really trippy, psychedelic duet with Alice Cooper.&quot; &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; is an excellent very fast paced hard-rocker. &quot;Don't Damn Me&quot; features some of Rose's best, most soul searching lyrics. &quot;Bad Apples&quot; is another hard rocker and features one of Slash's best solos. &quot;Dead Horse&quot; is one of the album's highlights. Rose best, most personal lyrics are found right here. The closing epic &quot;Coma,&quot; along with &quot;November Rain&quot; is the album's highlight. It simply shows Axl Rose and Slash at their best. The song is just a monster, pure and simple. Axl Rose's 30+ second delivery at the end over Slash's playing is one of the most powerful, vital, ingenious moments in rock. \n\nI bought &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; when I was 13 years old, and now, at 26, it remains one of my most favorite albums of all time. If you are looking for an AFD part two, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for instant gratification, go buy a Blink 182 album. If you want a masterpiece that has songs that are instantly addictive as well as songs that take time to appreciate, buy &quot;Use Your Illusion I.&quot; \n\nby Daniel Maltzman\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Right Next Door To Hell.wma                            \n02 - Dust N' Bones.wma                                      \n03 - Live And Let Die.wma                                   \n04 - Don't Cry (Original).wma                               \n05 - Perfect Crime.wma                                      \n06 - You Ain't The First.wma                                \n07 - Bad Obsession.wma                                      \n08 - Back Off Bitch.wma                                     \n09 - Double Talkin' Jive.wma                                \n10 - November Rain.wma                                      \n11 - The Garden.wma                                         \n12 - Garden Of Eden.wma                                     \n13 - Don't Damn Me.wma                                      \n14 - Bad Apples.wma                                         \n15 - Dead Horse.wma                                         \n16 - Coma.wma           \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080f3ec3fe7995fd2c257647ae2853574466cc2b","amp;dn":"Guns+N%5C%27+Roses+-+Use+Your+Illusion+I+%281991%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080f3ec3fe7995fd2c257647ae2853574466cc2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,15,62,195,254,121,149,253,44,37,118,71,174,40,83,87,68,102,204,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
