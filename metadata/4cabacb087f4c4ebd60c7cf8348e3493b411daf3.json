In the new postwar songs, lyrics were privileged over the bigger orchestrations favored by singers like Edith Piaf; GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©co's intellectual bent made her the perfect interpreter for this new movement. Her singing style shared the dramatic enunciation of Jacques Brel and the droll delivery of Georges Brassens, her contemporaries in quite different musical scenes, while showcasing a sensuality all her own. GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©co released the song &quot;Je Suis Qui Je Suis,&quot; again with words by PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vert  and music by Kosma, two years later -- it was a huge hit for her. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_Greco&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_Greco&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nmp3  192 kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cabacb087f4c4ebd60c7cf8348e3493b411daf3","amp;dn":"Juliette+Gr%C3%83%C2%A9co+Une+Collection+des+Meilleures+Chansons+%285CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cabacb087f4c4ebd60c7cf8348e3493b411daf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,171,172,176,135,244,196,235,214,12,124,248,52,142,52,147,180,17,218,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
