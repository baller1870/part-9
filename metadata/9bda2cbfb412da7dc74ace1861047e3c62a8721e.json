Ready to move on. Ready to start forgetting the night that ripped her life apart.\n\nHer plans come to a screeching halt when not one, but both brothers responsible for the accident end up back in her life again.\n\nZack is cruel, selfish and constantly rubbing what happened to her friend in Lottie's face. \n\nZan is different. He listens to her awkward ramblings. He loves &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as much as she does, and his dark eyes are irresistible. His words are few and far between, but when he does speak, she can't help but listen. \n\nThe trouble is, Zan was the driver in the accident, and now Lottie's discovered he lied to her about what happened that night. Now she must decide if trusting him again will lead to real forgiveness, or deeper heartache.\n\nBook 2: Faster We Burn (Fall and Rise #2) by Chelsea M. Cameron (April 2013) \n\nThis is a New Adult Contemporary Romance and is suitable for ages 17 and up, due to language and scenes of sensuality\n\nKatie Hallman is done with douchebags. Done with guys who treat her like crap and leave her broken. But then Stryker Grant is there anyway. With his numerous piercings and bleached hair, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the polar opposite of all of her past relationships, which makes him the perfect candidate.\n\nAt first, Katie just sees him as a physical escape from her previous rocky relationship, and Stryker doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to mind just being a distraction from KatieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems. But soon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting under her skin, peeling back layers sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather keep covered. She tries to make it clear that she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a relationship, but keeps breaking her own rules.\n\nThen a tragedy sends Katie into the only arms that are there to catch her, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll realize that she needs him more than she ever thought possible. But is she ready to let herself trust another guy with her already-battered heart? Or will she push him away to protect herself from getting hurt again? \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bda2cbfb412da7dc74ace1861047e3c62a8721e","amp;dn":"Fall+and+Rise+Series+%281-2%29+by+Chelsea+M.+Cameron+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bda2cbfb412da7dc74ace1861047e3c62a8721e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,218,44,191,180,18,218,125,199,74,206,24,97,4,126,60,98,168,114,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
