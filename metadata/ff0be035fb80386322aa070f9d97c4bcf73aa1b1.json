Working with acclaimed producer Don Gehman (R.E.M., Mellencamp) and Emmy award winning composer/producer Matthew Gerrard, this is the first time the band has significantly embarked on co-writing. With key placements already secured for new songs 'Rule The World' (ESPN Monday Night Football, The NFL on Fox) and 'Can't Slow Down' (all NASCAR programming), the band is poised to release the first single off the album, 'Don't Walk Away.' Rolling Stone says, 'The rockers combine their musical roots with bluesy rock, harmonizing on tales of difficult times and romantic interestsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦packing in some slick guitar work between the storytelling.'\n\n\n01.
