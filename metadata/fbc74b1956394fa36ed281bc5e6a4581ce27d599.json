(Most of these have been included in my series of huge torrents of graphic novels &amp; trade paperbacks, so if you've downloaded those, you may want to pass on this.)\n\nI've renamed the files by the year the story was published, for the benefit of the random movie watchers who stumble in here.\n\nHey movie fans, if you're new to comics, you can read all of these using free comic book reader software. Two of the most popular are CDisplayEX and ComicRack.\n\n------\n\nThis torrent contains: \n\nGRAPHIC NOVELS and TRADES\n(1939) DC ARCHIVE EDITIONS - SUPERMAN ARCHIVES - VOLUME 1 (1989) (DC)\n(1940) DC ARCHIVE EDITIONS - SUPERMAN ARCHIVES - VOLUME 2 (1990) (DC)\n(1941) DC ARCHIVE EDITIONS - SUPERMAN ARCHIVES - VOLUME 3 (1991) (DC)\n(1942) DC ARCHIVE EDITIONS - SUPERMAN ARCHIVES - VOLUME 4 (1994) (DC)\n(1985) SUPERMAN - WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MAN OF TOMORROW\n(1986) SUPERMAN - THE MAN OF STEEL VOLUME 1 (1987) (DC)\n(1986) SUPERMAN - THE MAN OF STEEL VOLUME 2 (2003) (DC)\n(1987) SUPERMAN - THE MAN OF STEEL VOLUME 3 (2004) (DC)\n(1987) SUPERMAN - THE MAN OF STEEL VOLUME 4 (2005) (DC)\n(1987) SUPERMAN - THE MAN OF STEEL VOLUME 5 (2006) (DC)\n(1993) THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN - BOOK I - DOOMSDAY\n(1993) THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN - BOOK II - FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND\n(1993) THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN - BOOK III - REIGN OF THE SUPERMEN\n(1993) THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN - BOOK IV - THE RETURN OF SUPERMAN\n(2000) SUPERMAN AND BATMAN - GENERATIONS (DC)\n(2004) SUPERMAN - RED SON (2004) (DC) (Sepi-DCP)\n(2008) SUPERMAN - BRANIAC (DC) (DCP Essentials) (116p)\n(2008) SUPERMAN - NEW KRYPTON (DC) (DCP Essentials) (236p)\n(2010) Superman - Earth One - Volume One (Hul-konnen-DCP)\n(2012) Superman - Earth One - Volume Two (Hul-konnen-DCP)\n\nCOMICS\n(1989) Lex Luthor - The Unauthorized Biography (DobisP.R.-Novus-HD)\n(1996) SUPERMAN - THE WEDDING ALBUM (DC)\n(1999) THE INCREDIBLE HULK VS.
