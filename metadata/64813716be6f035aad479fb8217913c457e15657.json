The copyright date is 2000. Says For Windows 2000/ME/98, but confirmed working on XP. Not sure about vista. \n\nMany years ago, when the land of Bersiah was ruled by the evillich Keeliani, the seven heroes of Xok arose. One of their number, Rick Miner, perished in battle with the Black Dragon Nibles. Devasted, the remaining six heroes invoked the power of the old dragon\\&amp;#039;s heart to bring their fallen companion back to life. But something went terribly wrong, and Rick Miner was ressurected as Rick Blood, possessing all the powers of the old dragon and more. And so the War of Heroes began, and so your challenge begins... \n\nThis game is a classic, and is a lot like Warcraft III. Rated teen for Animated Blood and Animated Violence. \n\nIncludes: Game, CD-key, and latest patch.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64813716be6f035aad479fb8217913c457e15657","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Under+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64813716be6f035aad479fb8217913c457e15657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,129,55,22,190,111,3,90,173,71,159,184,33,121,19,196,87,225,86,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
