An EP of new material, entitled United World Rebellion: Chapter One, was released on April 16, with several other EPs set to follow within the following 12 to 18 months. In early February 2014, the band returned to the studio to begin work on United World Rebellion: Chapter Two. The release date for the EP is August 5' 2014.\nSkid Row on a reunion with Bach\n\nDave Sabo: &quot;Basically, in all honesty, it just didn't work out anymore. It worked for awhile, and then it didn't work. I've always said this: he's a great singer, a great frontman. The two of us, or maybe all of us, stopped getting along. I've always been the one, personally, that I live my life a certain way where if it's not fun anymore and not enjoyable, I have to get away from it. Life is too short Ã¢â‚¬â€ I want positivity in my life Ã¢â‚¬â€ and I'm sure he felt the same way. I think that we just got to a point where we did what we would do up until that particular point and it was time to go different ways. I have no animosity towards him whatsoever, I wish him all the best, I hope he does wonderful things; he's done well for himself. But, for me, my main focus is right now, with SKID ROW. I have a relationship with the other four members in my band that I'm really proud of and really happy of, and I'm happy to be creating new music and promoting it.&quot;\n\nRachel Bolan: &quot;I honestly feel that questions about him are so far off now, because Johnny is our singer and he has been in the band for 14 years. So answering a question like that is kind of a waste of time. I hope you understand.&quot;\n\n&quot;I'd really rather not talk about him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but I can say I think everybody has a beef with him, honestly.&quot;\n\nSebastian Bach: &quot;Rachel Bolan doesn't like me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but I would work with him any time, because the result of that dynamic is really good music. Nothing good comes easy. When I read interviews with my old band and they say, 'We get along great with our new singer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we have barbecues and drink tequila together,' You know what? I don't give a fuck about barbecues. You don't hear Mick Jagger saying he loves working with Keith Richards and that they have barbecues together. You hear Mick saying that he hates working with Richards. I don't think you have to be best friends with everybody to work with them.&quot; Bach's most recent outburst against his former colleagues came when he accused them of being &quot;allergic to cash&quot; in regard to a classic lineup reunion.\n\n&quot;I wouldn't be doing a reunion for the sound of the band. It's more like a stunt, like, people don't care about the sound of the band really. They would like to see the five guys together in a reunion it doesn't matter how we play, hehehe. Doesn't make any difference at all, that's popular culture. The public likes that kind of thing, I don't know why really but that's the way it is.&quot;\nCurrent members\nMain article: List of Skid Row band members\n\n    Dave &quot;The Snake&quot; Sabo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, backing vocals (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Rachel Bolan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Scotti Hill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, backing vocals (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Johnny Solinger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6871f13a956f6b6c4eb8cbb4baf0f171e2f646d2","amp;dn":"Skid+Row-Rise+Of+The+Damnation+Army-United+WLD+Rebellion+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6871f13a956f6b6c4eb8cbb4baf0f171e2f646d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,113,241,58,149,111,107,108,78,184,203,180,186,240,241,113,226,246,70,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
