Richard Sinclaire (Caravan), Pip Pyle (Delivery), Phil Miller (Matching Mole, Delivery) and Dave Stuart (Egg) established a supergroup that existed for only two albums.\n\nIt is not easy to describe in one sentence what the so-called Canterbury Music Scene stands for. To mention first are the musical similarities, secondly the geographical proximity of the involved musicians. Ideally both aspects are fitting, but this genre provides a big diversity of styles that can be best characterised as a blend of often catchy songs with jazz and classic influenced improvisations.\n\nKey-bands for the Canterbury scene are: Soft Machine, Caravan, Egg, (early)Gong, Hatfield And The North, National Health, Henry Cow, Gilgamesh, only to name a few. They all emerged from the British, late sixties music culture and succeeded till the end of the seventies.\n\n\nH&amp;tN albums:\n\n1973 - Hatfield &amp; The North\n1975 - The Rotters Club\n\ncovers and booklets included\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a61219126954c2e9b38cbb4440c14db157204da","amp;dn":"Hatfield+And+The+North+-+Two+Albums+-+1973+%2B+1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a61219126954c2e9b38cbb4440c14db157204da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,97,33,145,38,149,76,46,155,56,203,180,68,12,20,219,21,114,4,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
