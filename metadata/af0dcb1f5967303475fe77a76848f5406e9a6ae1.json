Also featuring trumpeter Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley on tenor, and bassist Doug Watkins, this set is most notable for the original versions of Silver's &quot;The Preacher&quot; and &quot;Doodlin',&quot; funky standards that helped launch hard bop and both the Jazz Messengers and Silver's quintet. Essential music.
