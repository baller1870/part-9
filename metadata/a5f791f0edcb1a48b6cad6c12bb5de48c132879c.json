Bigby embarks on a quest through the American Heartland to find a new location for Fabletown. In his wanderings, Bigby stumbles across a small town named Story City, that, amazingly enough, seems to be populated by werewolves. Who are they and where did they come from? They aren't Fables, but they sure aren't normal mundys. They seem to already know and revere Bigby, but at the same time they've captured and caged him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but why? Unravelling the many mysteries of Story City may cost Bigby more than his life.\n \nWritten by: Bill Willingham\nArt by: Jim Fern, Craig Hamilton, Ray Snyder, Mark Farmer\nCover by: Daniel Dos Santos\nColor, 144 Pages\nOn Sale: Nov 14 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5f791f0edcb1a48b6cad6c12bb5de48c132879c","amp;dn":"Fables+-+Werewolves+of+the+Heartland+%28Graphic+Novel%29+%28FIXED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5f791f0edcb1a48b6cad6c12bb5de48c132879c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,247,145,240,237,203,26,72,182,202,214,193,43,181,222,72,193,50,135,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
