Nicknamed &quot;CIVA&quot;,\n\nAn inertial navigation system (INS) is a navigation aid that uses a computer, motion sensors  and gyroscopes to continuously calculate via dead reckoning the position, orientation, and velocity  of a the aircraft without the need for external references.\n\nit was easily the most popular inertial navigation system used before wide adoption of GPS became possible in the 90's.\n\nThe CIVA could be found on 707, 727, some 737-100s and -200s, the DC-10 and L-1011 Tristar, and on the early 747-100, -200 and -300 variants.\n\nThis CIVA has primarily been developed to be used with the 727 series of FlyJSim. It can be installed with any other aircraft.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to suckel555","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6772b16e86087f66ebbf46ba254b4724e74c7935","amp;dn":"%5BX-Plane%5D+FlyJSim+CIVA+Navigation+System+%28for+FlyJSim+732+TwinJe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6772b16e86087f66ebbf46ba254b4724e74c7935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,114,177,110,134,8,127,102,235,191,70,186,37,75,71,36,231,76,121,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
