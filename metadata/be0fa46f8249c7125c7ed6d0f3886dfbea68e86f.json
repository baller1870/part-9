Taking its title from Jackson and Coltrane's nicknames, it is the only collaborative record by the pair, although only Jackson contributed original compositions. In actuality, the album belongs in Jackson's discography, as he was the session leader and still signed to Atlantic under the auspices of the Modern Jazz Quartet, and not in Coltrane's, who had left the label for Impulse Records at the time of this album's issue. However, like Prestige Records before them, as Coltrane's fame grew after he had stopped recording for the label, Atlantic used varied unissued recordings and released them with Coltrane's name more prominently displayed.\n\nVibraphonist Milt Jackson and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane make for a surprisingly complementary team on this 1959 studio session, their only joint recording. With fine backup by pianist Hank Jones, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Connie Kay, Bags and Trane stretch out on two of Jackson's originals (including &quot;The Late Late Blues&quot;) and three standards: a romping &quot;Three Little Words,&quot; &quot;The Night We Called It a Day,&quot; and the rapid &quot;Be-Bop.&quot; \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01.
