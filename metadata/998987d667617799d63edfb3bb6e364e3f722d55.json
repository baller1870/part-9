Keeping her end up while seven grown-up children tear about the fecking place like the eejits haven't got a home to go to.\n\nPacked with Mammy's tips for keeping a perfect family, or at least a family, as well as contributions from her children, neighbours and other hangers on, Mrs Brown's Family Handbook dispenses advice in her own inimical fecking style.\n\nYou'll learn:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ why every mammy's secret weapon is the tea towel\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ the dos and don't of cleaning up Granddad\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ what Dermot doesn't know about farting (not much)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ what Winnie knows about seks (not enough)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ all about the Five-Sausages-A-Day Diet (hint: contains sausages)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ from Maria all about pain relief in child birth (if its free, take it)\n\nThe perfect gift for anyone in a large family - it's one present and cheap - or with no family at all (seeing what they're missing might cheer the miserable feckers up), Mrs Brown's Family Handbook is also ideal for anyone sick and tired of giving out bloody DVDs for Christmas.\n\nBrendan O'Carroll is an Irish writer, producer, comedian, actor, director and author.
