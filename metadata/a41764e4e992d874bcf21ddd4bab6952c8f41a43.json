The group was initially composed of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Managed by the Wilsons' father Murry, the Beach Boys signed to Capitol Records in 1962. The band's early music gained popularity across the United States for its close vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a Southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. By the mid 1960s, Brian Wilson's growing creative ambition and songwriting ability would dominate the group's musical direction. The primarily Wilson-composed Pet Sounds album and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; single (both released in 1966) featured a complex, intricate and multi-layered sound that was a far cry from the simple surf rock of the Beach Boys' early years.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCarl and the Passions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;So Tough&quot; is the eighteenth studio album by The Beach Boys, released in 1972. Upon initial release, it was the second disc of a two-album set, with Pet Sounds as the first of the set (which The Beach Boys were able to license from Capitol Records). Because Carl and the Passions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;So Tough&quot; was a transitional album that saw the departure of one member and the introduction of two new ones, the result was a sound that was largely new ground for the band.\n\nThe title of the album was a reference to an early band Carl Wilson had been in as a teenager. It was also the first album released under a new deal with Warner Bros. that allowed the company to distribute all future Beach Boys product in foreign as well as domestic markets.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHolland is the nineteenth studio album by the American rock group The Beach Boys, released in January 1973. It was recorded in Baambrugge, Netherlands over the summer of 1972 using a reconstructed studio sent from California, and with two Brian Wilson tracks rush-recorded in Los Angeles and added to the album at the last minute.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41764e4e992d874bcf21ddd4bab6952c8f41a43","amp;dn":"Beach+Boys+-+Carl+%2B+The+Passions-So+Tough%2FHolland+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41764e4e992d874bcf21ddd4bab6952c8f41a43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,23,100,228,233,146,216,116,188,242,29,221,75,171,105,82,200,244,26,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
