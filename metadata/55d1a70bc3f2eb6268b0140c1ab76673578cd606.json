With love and reverence we worship Him, and in fear and longing we invoke His name. I testify that Muhammad is his servant, Prophet, His own beloved, best chosen and most trusted for His revelation, was sent down by Allah to save the human soul from self-indulgence and degradation, connecting it to the one who created the heavens and the earth. He was, by all means, a role model, and his message was a mercy and guidance for all mankind, giving them glad tidings and saving them from oppression. Peace and blessings be upon him.\n\nAddress: Yes! I Converted to Islam and here is Why?\nLanguage: English\nFormat: PDF\nPages:  65\nFormation : Muhammad Haneef Shahed\nReviewing : Muhammad AbdulRaoof\n\nShort Description: sample testimonies of those who studied Islam objectively and converted to it conscientiously. It is not that Islam needs such testimonies in order to verify its authenticity. Our intention is to let those who have not yet contemplated converting to Islam share the insights of those who already have by reading their testimonies and to know that Islam is a faith which is suitable for all ages and applicable until the end of time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d1a70bc3f2eb6268b0140c1ab76673578cd606","amp;dn":"Yes%21+I+Converted+to+Islam+and+here+is+Why%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d1a70bc3f2eb6268b0140c1ab76673578cd606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,209,167,11,195,242,235,98,104,176,20,12,26,183,102,115,87,140,214,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
