The listener will be both comfortable with and surprised by the changes he's made: his essential style/approach and the beauty of the music remain constant, but PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rt is no whispering new-age poster boy. Sometimes the sound just washes over the listener; more often the small complexities or intensities are the hooks by which we are captivated. &quot;Da pacem Domine&quot; is a prayer for peace. Its different tonal hues thrill as much as they soothe. There's much of Renaissance music in his work--under the layers of sound there is a solid, far more simple core. The Two Slavonic Psalms have a Russian feel unlike most of PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rt's other works, and the first is fleet and perky. The strange &quot;Dopo la vittoria&quot; tells the story of St Ambrose and St Augustine singing the Te Deum composed for his defeat over the Arians; the story part is presented in an odd, chatty manner, but the prayer itself is exclaimed with great dignity. The performances, by Paul Hillier, the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, and organist Christopher Bowers-Broadbent, do PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rt's ethereal, still, but ever-moving music absolute justice, and the recorded sound is crystal clear. --Robert Levine\n\n\nTracklist :\n\n1.\t  Da pacem Domine (2004)\n2.\t  Salve Regina (2001/2)\n3.\t  Zwei slawische Psalmen: Psalm 117 (1984)\n4.\t  Psalm 131 (1997)\n5.\t  Magnificat (1989)\n6.\t  An den Wassern zu Babel (1976/1984/1991)\n7.\t  Dopo la vittoria (1996/1998)\n8.\t  Nunc dimittis (2001)\n9.\t  Littlemore Tractus (2000)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df80391b49d9c1daa48c028ca780bce44fa96b71","amp;dn":"Da+Pacem+by+Arvo+P%C3%83%C2%A4rt++%282006%29+at+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df80391b49d9c1daa48c028ca780bce44fa96b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,128,57,27,73,217,193,218,164,140,2,140,167,128,188,228,79,169,107,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
