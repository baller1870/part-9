That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\nProjected remaining torrents and approximate file sizes. Several of these still have significant work needed and the size could go up or down. I'm betting on down for the last 3, though they continue to grow for now. All the cutting will occur when I sort through them after #53. Of course I also just added 1gb folder for a 200AD TPB I forgot to include in the Js. This caused a shift in the last three.\n\n17G\t48\tTo-Unk\n18G\t49\tUnl-Wes\n18G\t50\tWet-Wn\n14G\t51\tWonder Woman, Wonder Girl\n16G\t52\tWor-Wq\n14G\t53\tWr-Z\n19G\t54\tFill Torent a-c\n17G\t55\tFill Torent d-j\n17G\t56\tFill Torent k-z\n\nIt is frankly astonishing how much I  have missed, forgotten, screwed up, compromised on for space or other reasons, and just *blanked on* in this series, despite every effort to do it right this time. This is not true of course. If I had put EVERY effort into it, I would not have made those mistakes, omissions, and miss-steps. (I should have taken the escalator to avoid those). Was it the best I could do? No! The best I can do is *never good enough*, is never the ultimate effort, merely the penultimate. PEN ULTIMATE do you hear me PEN! Sounds like some lame Marvel super-hero. I should be LaserPrinter-Ultimate!, I should be 4D-Omnimedia-Solid-Projection Ultimate! The best I can do is never the best I can do! I could have devoted 24/7 to it! I could have given up everything else in my so called life! I could have abandoned my family, quit my job and holed up in a tiny cheap apartment somewhere, living off my savings, and poured over these things again and again, taking weeks if necessary to track down every last scanned issue of anything even tangentially connected to any DC publication! I could have gone out and PURCHASED some of the unscanned issues and scanned them! By &quot;gone out&quot; of course I mean &quot;ordered on the internet&quot;. Going out would be a distraction from my grossartige arbeit, my bolshaya rabota! Oh god, I'm an utter failure, I'm sorry dad, don't hit me! I'll do better! Mommy! mommy!\n\nAh hem. Guess I got a bit carried away. If I can catch all of these in the fills, perhaps I can rest easy. I don't want to be back here in a year or two attempting to torrent ever comic ever because somewhere in them they might mention bats or use the word green. (clear DC tie-ins)\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering: DC from Te-Tn\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nTitle in indica for below is &quot;Superman 3-D&quot;. It's here because it's commonly listed as &quot;Three-Dimensions Adventures- Superman in Startling 3-D&quot; based on the cover, even by the Phantom Stranger's DC scanned list which is usually more precise\n\nSuperman 3-D (Three-Dimensions Adventures-Superman in Startling 3-D) (1953,1997)\n\nWord of the day is &quot;thunder&quot; The world desperately needs a Thunder-Agents - Thunder Cats crossover, with special guest appearance by heroes and villains such as Storm,  Thor, Thunder (outsiders), Captain Thunder, Thunderbolt Jaxon, Blue Bolt, Johnny Thunder, Leslie Thunder, Chocolate Thunder (yes really - I did not make this up), Black Lightning, Thunderbolt, Lighting Man, Lightning Lord, Lightning Lad, Lightning Lass, Lightning Girl, Lightning Woman, Lightning Squirrel (again, really) Lash Lightning, Storm Shadow and Dragonstorm.\n\nOf course it should be a time traveling cross dimensional adventure so they they can fight both the WWII Germans with their Blitzkrieg tactics and of course, the Star Wars storm troopers.\n\n\nT.H.U.N.D.E.R.

Just one of those moments why I feel like spouting off about a random topic\n     Lest any of you chime in (in your heads) with the widely spread idea that the Number of the Beast is not 666 but 616, that's a big maybe. Just because a fragment of a copy of the  Revelaton of John was found that is older than any other copy, containing the number 616 instead of 666 proves nothing. It not even news that some ancient manuscripts had a different number. It takes a lot more than that to settle it.  I know a bunch of scholars (mostly not textual critics) have jumped on it, but scholars follow fads and &quot;neat new ideas&quot; too. Textual critics are these guys who study ancient documents that exist with variations between copies and try to determine which is closest to the original, whether it be the bible or a greek play. One of the things they'll tell you is older is not always better, and more copies with a particular variant proves nothing also. Imagine a guy makes a small error in copying and doesn't notice. That copy is copied by others and eventually there are dozens of copies with the mistake. Meanwhile a more accurate copy sits on a shelf uncopied. The majority vote is wrong. Or an erroneous copy just happens to be the one to survive when better copies perished. The great majority of ancient documents didn't survive the passage of a couple thousand years. When  two thousand years you reach, survive as well, you will not.\n    \n    I'm not advocating for 616, I'm just saying new discoveries are rarely settled questions from the start in science or any scholarly endeavor, though some eventually hold up to scrutiny.\n    \n    All this above because there is an attraction for me about the 616 possibility which I wanted to mention, but it's difficult for me to resist the temptation to digress. Sadly, not all my digressions are even trying to be funny. Just trying to your very soul.\n    \n     6 + 1 + 6  = 13. Thirteen is the number of me, I am the joshua13. It has been my favorite number since I was 13. Further, I have a special connection to the DC character Dr. 13 (which I will not reveal). I once used the pseudonym &quot;Doctor 13&quot; in something I worked on a very long time ago. Whenever possible I work 13 into things. Do I need to set a time for an automated operation on a computer at my job as an IT guy? Most people go with on the hour or half hour. I go for 13 minutes past the hour. If it's ok to do in the afternoon I go for 24 hour time - 13:13.  I could go on but my WQ (weirdness quotient) in the eyes of the world is already too high.\n \n \nTeam 7 (Image-WS\n     Team 7 v1 01-04 (1994-1995)\n     Team 7-Dead Reckong 01-04 (01-04 1996)\n     Team 7-Obective Hell 01-03 (05-07 1995)\n     Team X and Team 7 (Marvel(1996)\n\nTeam One-Stormwatch 01-02 (Image-WS(1995)\nTeam One-Wildcats 01-02 (Image-WS(1995)\nTeam Superman (1999)\nTeam Superman Secret Files 001 (1998)\nTeam Titans v1 01-24 (1992-1994)\nTeam Titans v1 Annual 01-02 (1993-1994)\nTeam Zero 01-05 (WS(2006)\n\nTeams and teams above. I am not a team player. I hate team games. I hate to work in teams. I  keep waiting for someone to say to me &quot;There is no I in team!&quot;. I am ready to fire back - &quot;But there is a ME!!!!&quot;. It's not that it's all about me, or I don't want to cooperate. It's not that I think I'm better than everyone else, or only my  ideas are good, or I never need any help (though all of that is true). It's  just that I hate everyone and keep thinking about how to kill them without getting caught whenever I'm asked to work on a team. This seriously impacts my productivity!  I'm a loner, an island (cause this mans IS), a solitary figure trodding though a harsh wilderness of his own making, an asocial (not anti) being, a misanthrope of a sort. It's paradise.\n\nTears of a Lamb Hitsuji no Namida scanlation-CMX substitute  - Tears of a lamb. Are they silent tears? or is this lamb a noisy lamb, not like the ones in the movie.

Teen beat was too close to &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; if I recall, so they had to change to avoid a suit. The it died. I postulate DC had no clue what it was doing, and was probably too embarrassed to give it a full effort in any case. Im sure DC would just like to forget. Bring it up if you're even out a t a bar with DC and the gang. Especially if Marvel is there. Watch DC, hem and haw about it. No I'm not talking about DC staff. I'm talking about anthropomorphizing the entire corporation itself. Remember corporations are people too! The US supreme court says so! So take DC out for dinner and drinks. DC will be whatever gender you prefer\n\nTeen Beat 001 (12-1967)\nTeen Beam 002 (02-1968)\n\n\nTeen Titans\n     DNAgents v1 014 (1984) - this is a &quot;non-crossover crossover&quot;  with the teen titans.

Rob Liefeld, who created the group conceived of them originally as a Teen Titans revision or reboot which never happened, but in a different form they became the Youngblood team you know and love, or dislike, or are indifferent about.
