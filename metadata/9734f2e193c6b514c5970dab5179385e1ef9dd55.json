So all thanks go to them.\n\nThe activator needs to be run as an administrator. If you don't run it as such you will be prompted to do so.\n\nBoth files need to be in the same directory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9734f2e193c6b514c5970dab5179385e1ef9dd55","amp;dn":"QB2013_Patcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9734f2e193c6b514c5970dab5179385e1ef9dd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,52,242,225,147,198,181,20,197,151,13,171,81,121,56,94,30,249,221,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
