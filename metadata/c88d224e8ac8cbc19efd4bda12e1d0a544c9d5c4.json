Scotch emerged from barley, tequila from agave, rum from sugarcane, bourbon from corn. Thirsty yet? In The Drunken Botanist, Amy Stewart explores the dizzying array of herbs, flowers, trees, fruits, and fungi that humans have, through ingenuity, inspiration, and sheer desperation, contrived to transform into alcohol over the centuries.\n\nOf all the extraordinary and obscure plants that have been fermented and distilled, a few are dangerous, some are downright bizarre, and one is as ancient as dinosaurs - but each represents a unique cultural contribution to our global drinking traditions and our history. \n\nThis fascinating concoction of biology, chemistry, history, etymology, and mixology - with more than fifty drink recipes and growing tips for gardeners - will make you the most popular guest at any cocktail party.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;This wide-ranging mix of alcohol and plant trivia, drink recipes, and scientific research deserves a place on every home bar bookÃ‚Â­shelf for its conversational value alone... There are enough 'did you know?' moments in this book to fill a lifetime of conversational pauses.&quot;\n--Buffalo Spree\n\n&quot;A conversational tone and easy narrative manner is a disarming tactic, one where as soon as you expect a dumbed-down explanation comes the most extraordinary detail. Helpful graphic elements, box-outs and miniature fact-boxes help make sure you never get bogged down in the text but can dip in and out - and you will, again and again... book drink geeks would be crazy not to buy.&quot;\n--Class Magazine\n\n&quot;With more than 50 drink recipes, and growing tips, this highly entertaining book will please both cocktail enthusiasts and backyard gardeners. The inclusion of rich history throughout will delight armchair historians and the naturally curious. Highly recommended.&quot;\n--Library Journal, starred review\n\n&quot;Gardeners, nature lovers and mixologists will find themselves reaching frequently for this volume... A rich compendium of botanical lore for cocktail lovers.&quot;\n--Kirkus Reviews\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmy Stewart is the award-winning author of six books on the perils and pleasures of the natural world.
