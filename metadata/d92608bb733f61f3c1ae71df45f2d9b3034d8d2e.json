It offers a dizzying analysis of the madness of the Orion myth alongside a movingly sympathetic account of Ellis's unsung talent.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Orion-The-Man-who-Would-be-King-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1242Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1024x576\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 84 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 834 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pyw3w","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92608bb733f61f3c1ae71df45f2d9b3034d8d2e","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2015+Orion+The+Man+Who+Would+Be+King+576p+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92608bb733f61f3c1ae71df45f2d9b3034d8d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,38,8,187,115,63,97,243,193,174,113,223,69,242,217,179,3,77,141,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
