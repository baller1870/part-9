Recorded following the disbanding of Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity, who scored a worldwide hit with their highly imaginative cover of Dylan's This Wheel's on Fire. The sessions featured a stellar cast of guest musicians from the worlds of jazz and rock, such as Elton Dean, Nick Evans, Karl Jenkins and Marc Charig (all former members of Soft Machine), Brian Godding, Jim Creegan, Brian Belshaw (from the legendary group Blossom Toes) and other celebrated lumini, including Chris Speeding, Bob Downes and Keith Tippett, Driscoll's future husband.\n1969 is a unique work, veering from folk influences to experimental free form jazz, showcasing the vocal ability of Julie Driscoll, surely one of Britain's greatest ever female vocalists. The release of the album, remastered from the original master tapes, is another milestone in Eclectic's catalogue reissue series and is sure to receive enthusiastic coverage in the quality music press. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n-------------------------------------\n\nJulie Driscoll was a respected vocalist of the late 1960s British pop scene, christened &quot;The Face&quot; by the U.K. music press. She made a number of albums with organist Brian Auger and the Brian Auger Trinity, including a 1968 hit cover of Dylan's &quot;This Wheel's on Fire.&quot; This debut inaugurated her solo career and saw her supported by a crack crew of 'Canterbury'-associated musicians, almost all of whom would show up again several years down the road to support her next solo release, Sunset Glow. It was on this recording that she was introduced to pianist Keith Tippett, and by the time of this album's eventual release in 1971, she was Mrs. Julie Tippett (and later &quot;Tippetts&quot;). This record draws upon the influences in her stylistic repertoire, primarily folk and brass-arranged R&amp;B sporting the great British blues-rock guitarist Chris Spedding on lead. There are two incredible songs in particular on 1969 that simply should not be passed up, each putting the spotlight on Driscoll and her acoustic. &quot;Those That We Love&quot; tells the story of cruel Elaine, a beautiful woman who leaves all men who pursue her in the dust. Accompanied by bassist Jeff Clyne and Keith Tippett on piano and a very fragile celeste, Driscoll's vocal simultaneously pines and cautions in the chorus: &quot;Yes it's those that we love who will always forsake us/ and it's those that love us, we will always forget...&quot; &quot;The Choice&quot; finds Driscoll again accompanied by Clyne, but with flute contributions by Bob Downes in place of Tippett's keyboards. This is an outstanding track, and my favorite song on the album.\n\nThe impressive stature of Driscoll's voice was already obvious early in her career. One moment it has the gentle expressiveness that reveals her to be very much a peer of Sandy Denny though with her own unique tone; the next she is belting out all the way with soul few others could match, such as on &quot;A New Awakening,&quot; &quot;Leaving It All Behind,&quot; and &quot;Break-Out.&quot; But whether cool or fiery, throughout this album it all comes out with an exceptional degree of heart.\n\nThe material of 1969 is consistently strong. There is neither one bad track nor one out-of-sync musical performance among the bunch. Yet another forgotten, buried treasure that has been lost to time, but is ready to be unearthed by a new generation of listeners searching for something of quality.\nJoe McGlinchey at progreviews.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:885be18211c08d198e82d921a72a660b8747cca4","amp;dn":"Julie+Driscoll+-+1969+%281969%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"885be18211c08d198e82d921a72a660b8747cca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,91,225,130,17,192,141,25,142,130,217,33,167,42,102,11,135,71,204,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
