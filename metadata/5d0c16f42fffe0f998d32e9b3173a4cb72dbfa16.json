He became a symbol of America itself. He epitomized the Western film, which for many people epitomized America. He identified with conservative political causes from the early 1930s to his death in 1979, making him a hero to one generation of Americans and a villain to another. But unlike fellow actor Ronald Reagan, Wayne had no interest in politics as a career. Like many stars, he altered his life story, claiming to have become an actor almost by accident when in fact he had studied drama and aspired to act for most of his youth. He married three times, all to Latina women, and conducted a lengthy affair with Marlene Dietrich, as unlikely a romantic partner as one could imagine for the Duke. Wayne projected dignity, integrity, and strength in all his films, even when his characters were flawed, and whatever character he played was always prepared to confront injustice in his own way. More than thirty years after his death, he remains the standard by which male stars are judged and an actor whose morally unambiguous films continue to attract sizeable audiences.\n\nScott Eyman interviewed Wayne, as well as many family members, and he has drawn on previously unpublished reminiscences from friends and associates of the Duke in this biography, as well as documents from his production company that shed light on WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business affairs. He traces Wayne from his childhood to his stardom in Stagecoach and dozens of films after that. Eyman perceptively analyzes WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with John Ford, the director with whom heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most associated and who made some of WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest films, among them She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, The Quiet Man, and The Searchers. His evaluation of Wayne himself is shrewd: a skilled actor who was reluctant to step outside his comfort zone. Wayne was self-aware; he once said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played the kind of man IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to have been.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that man and the real John Wayne who are brilliantly profiled in Scott EymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insightful biography of a true American legend.\n\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster; First Edition edition (April 1, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439199582\nISBN-13: 978-1439199589\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\nThis is a fine biography of two men: Marion Ã¢â‚¬Å“DukeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Morrison, the jock who wound up working on a movie lot and eventually stepped hesitantly in front of the camera, and John Wayne, MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alter ego, the movie star who bore only a passing resemblance to Morrison himself. A studio chief gave Morrison, then a young, mostly unknown actor, his new name, and over the next several decades, Morrison built a persona around it; but, as the author points out, he never legally changed his name, never really thought of himself as John Wayne. Eyman tracks MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, showing how one impacted the other (Morrison became a better actor as he became comfortable with the Wayne mannerisms and performance style). The book nicely balances the personal and the professional and offers us an opportunity to get to know the man who stood, not in John WayneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadow (not that, by any means) but sort of beside him. A fine show-biz biography, delivering what fans want about the starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career but probing with uncommon depth into his personality. --David Pitt\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nProbably The Best Wayne Bio To Date\nBy G.I Gurdjieff TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on April 3, 2014\nI read the electronic pre-publication copy of this book compliments of NetGalley. The opinions expressed in this review are mine.\nI initially had no specific expectations about this book. I have read several Wayne bios and assumed that this might be a rehash of the others. To my way of thinking everything worthwhile had been said.\nAs it turned out, either time had blurred my recollections or Scott Eyman looked at Wayne with a fresh outlook. This was a very good book. It was broken down in three segments that covered Wayne's early life and career, his flush years as an accepted actor and bonified star, and his later years as an iconic old lion. Eyman diverted from earlier biographers by providing a lot of personal information about Wayne the actor and Wayne's personal insecurities. As Eyman readily points out, Wayne spent a good portion of his life trying to please his mother who summarily rejected him in favor of his brother who was four years his junior. By his mother's standards Wayne was incapable of doing anything right. Wayne also was publicly very low key about how he fell into movies, but he wanted to be successful and also wanted to be authentic. His attempts at getting some coaching regarding his acting are funny but also reflect a man who fought his way from the bottom up.\nAs for Wayne, he was often a case study in contradictions. He wanted to be a good husband and father, but he ended up coming up short in that area. Sadly, he came to the realization that he let his first marriage slip through his hands and was left with plenty of regret.He got into the movies to make money initially as a prop man and film extra.. While he wasn't a trained actor, he worked hard to learn his craft and render a good performance even when he was the king of the cheap western.\n\nThoroughly Researched and Tremendously Enjoyable\nBy SeattleBookMama on April 1, 2014\nWhen I was young, John Wayne was everywhere. His new movies were in theaters, and his old ones were on television. I remember him primarily as the quintessential cowboyÃ¢â‚¬â€his most oft-played roleÃ¢â‚¬â€and particularly as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, for which he won the Academy Award. I also remember him as the first big celebrity to announce on television that Ã¢â‚¬Å“I licked the Big C.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And then, oh damn, he died of it anywayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but not for some time. And I read this biography to fill in the gaps, since I actually knew very little.\n\nThere are two popular assumptions made about Wayne, I think, that this biography does a thorough job of smacking down in the dirt where they belong. The first is that he was playing himself in those movies, a big, dumb galoot of some sort. In fact, he was very bright and well read. A journalist makes the error of talking to down to him, asking if he is familiar with the work of Eugene OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neil. Wayne says that he has been to college, and yes, he has read OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neil.\n\nThe second popular notion is that he emerged from nowhere as this enormous star, as some indeed did. Wayne did nothing to suppress such tales; in fact, he liked to pretend, our author says, that he was just doing props work and sort of fell into acting. But nothing could be farther from the truth. He wanted to act very much, and he put up with ten years of very hard work, in dust and heat and all kinds of environments, required to expend immense amounts of physical energy and strength (which he fortunately had). Ford, who most often directed him, was nasty and abusive toward most of the actors with whom he worked, including Wayne, who just took it. There was no stunt so dangerous that if his double was not available, he would not do it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0c16f42fffe0f998d32e9b3173a4cb72dbfa16","amp;dn":"%5BScott+Eyman%5DJohn+Wayne+The+Life+and+Legend+%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0c16f42fffe0f998d32e9b3173a4cb72dbfa16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,12,22,244,47,255,224,249,152,211,46,155,49,115,164,203,114,219,250,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
