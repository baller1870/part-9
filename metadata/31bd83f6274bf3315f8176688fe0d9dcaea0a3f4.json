The turntable and all electronics were sited on performance enhancing Sonority shelving (very inert dense cast acrylic). All electronics were also fed pure balanced power via a 300 lb Equitech wall transformer. \n\nI also have the MFSL Ultradisk CD here to compare this transcription with-and there is no comparison. Which is why this is the version I am uploading-vinyl noise and all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31bd83f6274bf3315f8176688fe0d9dcaea0a3f4","amp;dn":"Supertramp-Crime+of+the+Century+MFSL+audiophile+vinyl+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31bd83f6274bf3315f8176688fe0d9dcaea0a3f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,189,131,246,39,75,243,49,95,129,118,104,143,224,217,220,174,160,163,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
