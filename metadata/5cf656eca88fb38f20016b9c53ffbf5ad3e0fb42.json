The line then follows the left bank of the Mosel to Cochem, all the while passing well-known wine villages such as Winningen and LÃ¶f. \r\n\r\nAfter Cochem, the line runs through the most important structure found on the route, the Kaiser Wilhelm Tunnel â€“ at 4,205 metres long, it was once Germanyâ€™s longest railway tunnel until 1985. \r\n\r\nAfter the Kaiser Wilhelm Tunnel, the line once again crosses the Mosel River near Ediger-Eller on a 281 metre long, five-span steel plate girder bridge. From Bullay, trains cross the well-known dual deck bridge and then the railway viaduct near PÃ¼nderich. It is here where the route branches off towards Traben-Trarbach, while the main route leaves the Mosel Valley and proceeds to Trier through to Wittlich. \r\n\r\nJust a short distance from Trier, the route meets the Mosel River for the penultimate time, before passing Ehrang with its large depot and goods station, Pfalzel and finally Trier, where a large industrial area and harbour dominate the landscape. \r\n\r\nThe route today is heavily used by freight traffic crossing Germany onto their final destinations across Europe. A major freight user is the continual flow of heavy iron ore trains from the North Sea ports to the Dillinger HÃ¼tte steelworks in the Saarland. Regionalbahn and Regional-Express trains form the majority of passenger trains and until 2014, InterCity services from Trier to Berlin. \r\n\r\nIncluded in the Mosel Valley (Koblenz-Trier) route for Train Simulator, developed by Aerosoft, is the BR 189 electric locomotive in DB livery and a BR 628/928 diesel railcar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL WORK ON LEGIT AND PIRATED VERSION OF TRAIN SIMULATOR 2015!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf656eca88fb38f20016b9c53ffbf5ad3e0fb42","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+DTG+Mosel+Valley+Koblenz+-Trier+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf656eca88fb38f20016b9c53ffbf5ad3e0fb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,246,86,236,168,143,179,143,32,1,107,156,83,255,191,90,211,224,251,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
