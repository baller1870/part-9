When recording for\nthe album finished, drummer Bill Bruford had grown tired of the bands\nstyle and song writing methods and left to join King Crimson.\n\nBackground\n\nFollowing the release of their fourth studio album Fragile [1971],\nYes enjoyed their greatest commercial and critical success since their\nformation. When their well-received 1971Ã¢â‚¬â€œ72 tour of Europe and North\nAmerica to promote the album ended in March 1972, the band started\nwork on their next record. The line-up during this time was singer\nJon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, guitarist\nSteve Howe, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman.\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01 - Close To The Edge - [New Stereo Mix] [18:33]\n02 - Close To The Edge - [UK Vinyl Transfer] [18:41]\n03 - Close To The Edge - [Flat Transfer From Original Master] [18:47]\n04 - Close To The Edge - [Early Assembly - Rough mix] [17:41]\n05 - Close To The Edge - 5.1 [18:41]\n06 - And You And I - Promo Single Edit [Stereo] [03:30]\n07 - And You And I - [Flat Transfer From Original Master] [10:14]\n08 - And You And I - [New Stereo Mix] [10:08]\n09 - And You And I - [Alt. version] [10:17]\n10 - And You And I - [UK Vinyl Transfer] [10:13]\n11 - And You And I - Single Edit [mono] [03:30]\n12 - And You And I - 5.1 [10:13]\n13 - Siberian Khatru - [New Stereo Mix] [09:00]\n14 - Siberian Khatru - [UK Vinyl Transfer] [08:58]\n15 - Siberian Khatru - 5.1 [08:58]\n16 - Siberian Khatru - [Flat Transfer From Original Master] [09:06]\n17 - America - [New Stereo Mix] [10:37]\n18 - America - [2013] 5.1 [10:37]\n19 - America - Single Edit [mono] [04:21]\n20 - America - [Flat Transfer From Original Master] [10:33]\n21 - Siberian - [Studio Run Through of Siberian Khatru] [09:23]\n22 - Total Mass Retain - [Single Edit] [Stereo] [3:26]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Yes\nGenre: Progressive rock\nAlbum Release Year: BluRay 2013\nLabel: Panegyric\nBarcode: GYRBD50012\nNumber of Tracks: 22\nTotal Duration: 3:55:27.752\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: PCM\nCodec Version: lossless / PCM\nEncoding Bit Rate: 7381 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [76.1%]; 6 [20.6%]; 1 [3.3%]\nAudio Quality: 24bit / 96000 Hz [79.3%]; 192000 Hz [20.7%]\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original BluRay Release M2TS\nConverter: DVD Audio Extractor\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nAdditional Files: foo_dr, MD5, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 12.1 GB [13 035 336 996 bytes]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1444942&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pastebay.net/1444942&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0627e112ce8453751fb31707b9cba41c1fdd3060","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Close+To+The+Edge+-+%5B96-192kHz-24bit%5D+1972-2013+%5BWAV%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0627e112ce8453751fb31707b9cba41c1fdd3060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,39,225,18,206,132,83,117,31,179,23,7,185,203,164,28,31,221,48,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
