In this first volume of Brilliant ClassicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s survey of HaydnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, issued to mark the 200th anniversary of his death in 1809, are many of his most famous works: all 104 symphonies, his two oratorios of imperishable power and beauty, The Creation and The Seasons, as well as another with much no less striking music, The Return of Tobit. There are several of the operas he wrote for the court at Eszterhaza, where he was more or less a servant-prisoner for most of his adult life, and Ã¢â‚¬â€ a first on disc Ã¢â‚¬â€ a complete recording of the 126 trios written at the behest of the courtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prince for an obsolete string instrument, the baryton, in which the prince had himself attained a modest accomplishment. Most of the string quartets are here too, in recordings made especially for Brilliant by the Buchberger Quartet, and historically informed interpretations of the complete piano sonatas on instruments of HaydnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day. This is a significant contribution to the anniversary of one of the great composers, with much new material, and at an unbeatable price.\n\n    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n    - Bonus CD-ROM contains song texts and a specially commissioned essay exploring HaydnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, genre by genre, by the renowned Haydn authority, Richard Wigmore\n    - New recordings of bayton fios and other chamber works made especially for this set and not previously released","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cb35242911d0c8097c85104a64e379826692c80","amp;dn":"Haydn+Complete+Works+%5BBrilliant+label%5D+part+5+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cb35242911d0c8097c85104a64e379826692c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,179,82,66,145,29,12,128,151,200,81,4,166,78,55,152,38,105,44,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
