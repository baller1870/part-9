For the creation of art?\nWhy do dogs have curly tails?\nWhat can microbes tell us about morality?\nThese and many other questions are tackled by renowned evolutionist David Sloan Wilson in this witty and groundbreaking new book. With stories that entertain as much as they inform, Wilson outlines the basic principles of evolution and shows how, properly understood, they can illuminate the length and breadth of creation, from the origin of life to the nature of religion. Now everyone can move beyond the sterile debates about creationism and intelligent design to share DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s panoramic view of animal and human life, seamlessly connected to each other.\nEvolution, as Wilson explains, is not just about dinosaurs and human origins, but about why all species behave as they doÃ¢â‚¬â€from beetles that devour their own young, to bees that function as a collective brain, to dogs that are smarter in some respects than our closest ape relatives. And basic evolutionary principles are also the foundation for humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s capacity for symbolic thought, culture, and morality.\nIn example after example, Wilson sheds new light on DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand theory and how it can be applied to daily life. By turns thoughtful, provocative, and daringly funny, Evolution for Everyone addresses some of the deepest philosophical and social issues of this or any age. In helping us come to a deeper understanding of human beings and our place in the world, it might also help us to improve that world.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. Evolution is far more than just dinosaurs and fossils, Wilson says, and he enthusiastically explains, with a clear and pleasing style, how it affects our everyday lives. This is Wilson's fourth book on evolution (Darwin's Cathedral, etc.) and is by far the most accessible account of evolution for a general audience, as well as the farthest ranging. Building on diverse examples, Wilson demonstrates that evolution is completely relevant to modern human affairs, including how we use language, create culture and define morality. The discussion is as entertaining as it is easy to follow, covering topics as seemingly unrelated as why the burying beetle commits infanticide and why so many domestic animals have floppy ears. For readers seeking a more technical presentation, Wilson offers both a complete bibliography and list of Web sites for reference. Readers who've grown weary of the usual treatment of evolution as a deadly foe to religion will find Wilson's book a cheerful antidote, breaking new ground in its sweeping breadth and offering much to think about. (Apr. 3)\n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\nEvolution for Everyone is David Sloan Wilson's fifth book on the subject (including Darwin's Cathedral and The Literary Animal) and the most reader-friendly. Critics favorably compare the effort to Steven J. Levitt's and Stephen J. Dubner's runaway best seller Freakonomics. They claim that Wilson, professor of biology and anthropology at Britain's Binghamton University, does for evolution what those two authors did for economicsÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, draw interesting and unexpected connections between musty theory and its practical applications in our everyday lives. Although most of his observations are right on the mark, Wilson's desire to connect evolution and religion may strike some as overreaching or preachy.\n\nFrom Booklist\nWilson, the author of Darwin's Cathedral (2002), tends to approach evolution from slightly offbeat angles. Describing himself as simply an evolutionist (rather than an evolutionary biologist, or some other qualifier), he uses the principles of evolution to understand &quot;all things human.&quot; Can evolutionary theory explain the horizontal-vertical dimensions in religion (&quot;out there&quot; versus &quot;up there&quot;)? Is there a genetic basis for the human desire to dance? Is there an evolutionary explanation for the simplest human traits, such as laughter? The author describes his book as a &quot;journey from the origin of life to human morality and religion,&quot; and that sums it up pretty nicely. Sure to be derided or condemned by some evolutionary specialists--especially those who live in the Ivory Archipelago, Wilson's &quot;home&quot; for scientists who microscopically examine Darwin's theory while ignoring its larger, real-world implications--the book is nevertheless ambitious, thoughtful, and intellectually stimulating. Readers will agree or disagree with Wilson to varying degrees, but they will all agree on one thing: he makes you think hard about how we got the way we are. David Pitt\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;In this age of mounting mistrust between science and religion in American societyÃ¢â‚¬â€especially in America's classroomsÃ¢â‚¬â€David Sloan Wilson's Evolution for Everyone comes as a breath of fresh air. Without stooping to condemn those whose religious beliefs lead them to reject evolution, Wilson clearly but gently shows how evolution is essential to understanding all aspects of our daily lives. Wilson knows the power of a good storyÃ¢â‚¬â€and most of his 36 chapters are short, riveting accounts of evolution and the scientists who have puzzled out the intricacies, and importance, of understanding evolution in human life. Evolution for Everyone fills a gap in understanding evolution, and will help in the much-needed bridge building across the divide that has threatened educational values in recent years.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Niles Eldredge, Division of Paleontology The American Museum of Natural History New York, New York\n\n&quot;Evolution for Everyone is a remarkable contribution. No other author has managed to combine mastery of the subject with such a clear and interesting explanation of what it all means for human self-understanding. Aimed at the general reader, yet peppered with ideas original enough to engage scholars, it is truly a book for our time. &quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Edward O. Wilson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of On Human Nature\n\n&quot;A mind-stretching and unforgettable synthesis of biology, psychology, religion, and politics, this engrossing story is evolutionary biology at its very best.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Martin Seligman, author Learned Optimism and Authentic Happiness\n\n&quot;There tend to be two types of science books, those for professional scientists and those for the general public. Every once in awhile a book comes along that bridges this gap, and David Sloan Wilson's Evolution for Everyone is just such a bookÃ¢â‚¬â€a well written, page-turning narrative that can be enjoyed by anyone, that also contains original ideas that simply must be read by professional scientists because they push the science forward. I was amazed by how much new ground Wilson covers, how many new ideas he presents, so in this case &quot;everyone&quot; means just that: general readers and professional scientists alike.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œMichael Shermer, Publisher of Skeptic magazine, columnist for Scientific American, and the author of Why Darwin Matters\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Evolution for Everyone is tremendous fun. But don't be deceived. David Sloan Wilson is a master biologist, who just happens to be a wonderful story teller.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œSarah B. Hrdy, author of Mother Nature\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Wilson does for evolution what Steve Levitt does for economics in his book Freakonomics....Evolution for Everyone is full of gripping stories about the natural world, related with humor and a rare flair for language.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Chicago Sun Times\n\n&quot;With a clear passion for the subject, Wilson shows that understanding evolution is easy, even intuitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€it really is for everyone. If only everyone would read his book.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€New Scientist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Should be read by everyone interested in the natural world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Buffalo News\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDavid Sloan Wilson is distinguished professor of biology and anthropology at Binghamton University.
