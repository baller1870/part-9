Each engaging shape is designed to complement\npopular classroom themes. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, because the wheels are\nself-correcting (all students have to do is flip the moving answer-hider to\nreveal the solution), they offer children instant feedback. And, if a child\ndoes miss a problem, a turn of the wheel provides a fresh opportunity to\ntry again. Some of the wheels are interchangeable (Plus, Minus and\nTimes) so if, for example, you are doing a dinosaur unit, you can enhance\nthe unit by pairing the dinosaur shape with the problem wheel that\naddresses the math skill of your choice.\nMath Wheels are perfect for use with the whole class, in small group settings,\nand for individual one-on-one practice. They can be used as the focus\nof a teacher-directed activity, or placed in a learning center for children to\nuse independently or in pairs. And best of all, Math Wheels are easy to\nmake and simple to store.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12309c3b9de66169ab58a7b31318949d64d2fc5f","amp;dn":"Math+Learning+Wheels+-+Primary.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12309c3b9de66169ab58a7b31318949d64d2fc5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,48,156,59,157,230,97,105,171,88,167,179,19,24,148,157,100,210,252,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
