Masters At Work host the beautiful meeting of a host legendary artists -- Roy Ayers, George Benson, Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Jocelyn Brown, Vince Montana, and others -- all united in a magical session that brings Latin firmly back to the dancefloor with the power and majesty of the best 70s recordings! The whole thing's amazing -- a fantastic mix of Latin, funk, jazz, and house that's inspired a whole new generation of musicians -- and which has still yet to be duplicated years later! Includes the massive remake of &quot;I Am the Blackgold of the Sun&quot;, plus &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Sweet Tears&quot;, and the great cover of Bob James' &quot;Nautilus&quot;.
