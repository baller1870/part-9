Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty.\r\n\r\nAt 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife Constanze and two sons.\r\n\r\nHe composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that &quot;posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years&quot;.[\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRudolf Serkin (28 March 1903 â€“ 8 May 1991) was a Bohemian-born pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Beethoven interpreters of the 20th century.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaudio Abbado, Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI[1] (Italian pronunciation: [Ëˆklaudjo abËˆbaËdo]; 26 June 1933 â€“ 20 January 2014) was an Italian conductor. One of the most celebrated and respected conductors of the 20th century, particularly in the music of Gustav Mahler, he served as music director of the La Scala opera house in Milan, principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, music director of the Vienna State Opera, founder and director of Lucerne Festival Orchestra, music director of European Union Youth Orchestra and principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACKLIST:\r\n\r\n1-3 Piano Concerto No.21 in C Major, KV.467 (30:16)\r\n4-6 Piano Concerto No.23 in A Major, KV.488 (28:45)\r\n\r\nTOTAL TIME ............. 59:22\r\nSIZE:  240 MB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReality Ascent by Dragan Glavasic\r\nWake Up\r\n\r\n\r\n10:44 PM 9/1/2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c48e13f6adc546225a9f7514f0f387a24e034774","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Piano+concertos++21+23+-Serkin+Abbado+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c48e13f6adc546225a9f7514f0f387a24e034774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,142,19,246,173,197,70,34,90,159,117,20,240,243,135,162,78,3,71,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
