Ward's number-one New York Times best-selling Black Dagger Brotherhood continues as a royal bloodline is compromised by a grave threat to the throne.\n\nLong live the king.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAfter turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his father's mantle - with the help of his beloved mate. But the crown sets heavily on his head. As the war with the Lessening Society rages on, and the threat from the Band of Bastards truly hits home, he is forced to make choices that put everything - and everyone - at risk.\n\nBeth Randall thought she knew what she was getting into when she mated the last pure blooded vampire on the planet: An easy ride was not it. But when she decides she wants a child, she's unprepared for Wrath's response - or the distance it creates between them.\n\nThe question is, will true love win out... or tortured legacy take over?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c90c453c8a0b95c049bca797db9d516a52d278f","amp;dn":"J+R+Ward+-+Black+Dagger+Brotherhood+12+-+The+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c90c453c8a0b95c049bca797db9d516a52d278f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,144,196,83,200,160,185,92,4,155,202,121,125,185,213,22,165,45,39,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
