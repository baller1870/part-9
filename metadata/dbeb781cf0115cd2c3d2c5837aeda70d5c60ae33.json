FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©licie (Charlotte VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ry) and Charles (FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ric Van Den Driessche) had a brief affair during a seaside vacation. Then Charles went abroad on business, and FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©licie gave him her address so they could stay in touch; however, she made an unexplainable mistake in the address and has lost all trace of her lover. Five years later, she is still single and raising a daughter by Charles. Though she is courted both by her no-nonsense boss, Maxence (Michel Voletti), and her highbrow friend Loic (HervÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Furic), she is still in love with Charles and hopes to meet him again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104008/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104008/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
