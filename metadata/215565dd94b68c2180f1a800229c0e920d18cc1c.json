Fred CavayÃƒÂ©, whose first film Anything for Her was remade as the Russell Crowe thriller The Next Three Days, is the mastermind here; he brings together grizzled duo Vincent Lindon and Gilles Lellouche as a former cop and his still-on-the-force erstwhile partner; they buddy up to protect LindonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son from an extremely stabby drug gang after the kid witnesses a murder. CavayÃƒÂ© pumps up the car chases and shootouts, and pumps down the plausibility; but it all moves along at such a lick it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter much. \n\n\nVideo 942 x 400 / 24 fps / 963 kbps / Mp4\n\nAudio 128 kbps AAC\n\nDuration 1:30\n\nSeed to the Max - Merci beaucoup . . .\n\nSno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215565dd94b68c2180f1a800229c0e920d18cc1c","amp;dn":"Mea+Culpa+-+Hardcoded+Eng+Subs+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215565dd94b68c2180f1a800229c0e920d18cc1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,85,101,221,148,182,140,33,128,241,168,0,34,156,14,146,13,24,204,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
