Long ago, on the planet of Cybertron, a massive, powerful alien race divided into two factions, the noble Autobots, and the devious Decepticons. They fought for the sole access to a talisman known as the Allspark, a cube with the capacity to grant infinite power, and eventually the Autobots smuggled it off the planet's surface, hiding it in an unknown location on Earth. Now, hundreds of years later, the Deceptacons have come looking for it, and if the Autobots don't find it first, the Earth will be enslaved or destroyed by the evil aliens' use of its massive power. The Autobots don't know where the cube was hidden, but the information may be stored in the most unlikely of sources, as a gangly young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) who's just picked up his first car, has a strange connection to the Allspark's history, making him the unlikely ally of these enormous creatures, as they fight for humankind's survival and the chance to return home.\n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 23 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94ebb2219ac43a43961dcf87f331adcfd8aba3c","amp;dn":"Tranformers%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94ebb2219ac43a43961dcf87f331adcfd8aba3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,78,187,34,25,172,67,164,57,97,220,248,127,51,26,220,253,138,186,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
