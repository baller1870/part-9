When a website you are using is known to be at risk, 1Password Watchtower will flag that login as vulnerable. You can use the Watchtower check in the Security Audit section to see the list of logins which are known to be at risk.\n\nWhen enabled, 1Password will download a database of vulnerable domains. The vulnerability database is refreshed automatically. Your personal information is never transmitted.\n\nOther Improvements\n\nÃ¢â€”â€  Improved conflict resolution during syncing\nÃ¢â€”â€  Greek localization\nÃ¢â€”â€  Other bug fixes and improvements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:718a9579a673f882f158554e1fd3af74078f5907","amp;dn":"1Password+-+4.4+%5BAeroNovaTech%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"718a9579a673f882f158554e1fd3af74078f5907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,138,149,121,166,115,248,130,241,88,85,78,31,211,175,116,7,143,89,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
