The scene is New York, 1949: Anne Bancroft plays a struggling writer and passionate bibliophile, who answers an advertisement from a rare-volumes bookshop at 84 Charing Cross Road in London. Thus begins a two-decade romance by correspondence between Bancroft and Briton Anthony Hopkins, the man in charge of the overseas department of Marks and Company. Though several meetings are arranged, Bancroft and Hopkins never come face to face thanks to mitigating circumstances. But Anne finally makes it to London, and finds that much has changed. 84 Charing Cross Road was produced by Mel Brooks, the husband of star Anne Bancroft.\n\nFile Name .........................................: 84 Charing Cross Road.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,329,810,560 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:35:21\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1743 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.242 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 103 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090570/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090570/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by zoneyoutwonk, whom we thank\n\nDavid Jones - 84 Charing Cross Road (1987)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c189f23ad6bca8bd71bd1564119dc84dd7be1dc3","amp;dn":"David+Jones+-+84+Charing+Cross+Road+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c189f23ad6bca8bd71bd1564119dc84dd7be1dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,137,242,58,214,188,168,189,113,189,21,100,17,157,200,77,215,190,29,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
