Done! _Every_ plane was tested in FSX with Acceleration Pack!\n\n\nWHO:\n----\nThis package is for all new-schooler fans of the Dc-3 who use mainly FSX (like me), and especially dedicated to the FANS OF THE ICE Pilot Tv Show series! JUST GET IT!\n\n\nRegards.\n\n\nPS: I've only added one extra livery.. a gift for the Ice Pilot's fans :) Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecf7d401a4a999e13f0260cf7830e8c57cb1ae0","amp;dn":"FSX+-+MAAM-SIM+Douglas+R4D%2FDC-3%2FC-47+%2ANO-STRESS+INSTALLATION%2A+FO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecf7d401a4a999e13f0260cf7830e8c57cb1ae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,207,125,64,26,74,153,158,19,240,38,12,247,131,14,140,87,203,26,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
