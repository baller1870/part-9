Focusing on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), it explains how to establish security solutions for the range of wireless networks, including mobile ad-hoc networks, hybrid wireless networks, and sensor networks.\n\n* Addresses architecture and organization issues\n* Examines the different types of routing attacks for WANs\n* Explains how to ensure Quality of Service in secure routing\n* Considers honesty and trust-based IDS solutions\n* Explores emerging trends in WAN security\n* Describes the blackhole attack detection technique\n\nSurveying existing trust-based solutions, the book explores the potential of the CORIDS algorithm to provide trust-based solutions for secure mobile applications. Touching on more advanced topics, including security for smart power grids, securing cloud services, and energy-efficient IDSs, this book provides you with the tools to design and build secure next-generation wireless networking environments.\n\nAuthor:\n\nNabendu Chaki is a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta, India. Rituparna Chaki has been an associate professor in the A.K. Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta, India, since June 2013.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11161d7a975ab779385058fd042b1059724fbe59","amp;dn":"Intrusion+Detection+in+Wireless+Ad-Hoc+Networks+%282014-pdf%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11161d7a975ab779385058fd042b1059724fbe59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,22,29,122,151,90,183,121,56,80,88,253,4,43,16,89,114,79,190,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
