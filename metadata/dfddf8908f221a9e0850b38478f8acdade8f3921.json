When Sarah lands on Robert's doorstep with her suitcases, it seems at first that she has returned to her husband. Robert has several women staying at his place (research sources!), but when his real ex-wife arrives with their young son, he sends the women packing. Sarah, it turns out, is Robert's sister. As the two work out their own live's hurdles -- Robert, the unaccustomed father with his 8-year-old son, and Sarah, trying to cope with her custody battle and its results -- their way of handling adversity and personal burdens becomes the real subtext of the film. This film won the Golden Bear Award at the 1984 Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Love Streams.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 1438 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 16.6 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 0/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 2h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 1308 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.615\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.186\n      StreamSize : 1.24 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 15mn\n      Bit rate : 122 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 118 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\t  \n\t  IMDB: tt0087644\n\t  \n\t  English audio, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles (srt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfddf8908f221a9e0850b38478f8acdade8f3921","amp;dn":"Love+Streams+-+1984+-+John+Cassavetes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfddf8908f221a9e0850b38478f8acdade8f3921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,221,248,144,143,34,26,158,8,80,179,132,120,248,172,218,222,143,57,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
