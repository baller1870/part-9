Now Keegan examines these and other puzzles with a peerless understandin\ng of warfare, uncovering dimensions of the conflict that have eluded earlier historiography.\n\nWhile offering original and perceptive insights into psychology, ideology, demographics, and economics, Keegan reveals the war's hidden shape--a consequence of leadership, the ev\nolution of strategic logic, and, above all, geography, the Rosetta Stone of his legendary decipherments of all great battles. The American topography, Keegan argues, presented a\nbattle space of complexity and challenges virtually unmatched before or since. Out of a succession of mythic but chaotic engagements, he weaves an irresistible narrative illumina\nted with comparisons to the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and other conflicts.\n\nThe American Civil War is sure to be hailed as a definitive account of its eternally fascinating subject.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5261b84702e51599d8f69a94bf42c09bb129f5ee","amp;dn":"John+Keegan+The+American+Civil+War+Audiobook+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5261b84702e51599d8f69a94bf42c09bb129f5ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,97,184,71,2,229,21,153,216,246,154,148,191,66,192,155,177,41,245,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
