I remember playing a bit of it when I was younger, and reminiscing that I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t great at it, but I was only around six years old. Under the guidance of the originalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s director, Emiko Yamamoto, Sega Studios Australia have brought Castle Of Illusion into the modern age.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1982c5b9c56484c89d5713ddb63f8764978a0d","amp;dn":"Castle+of+Illusion+-+Starring+Mickey+Mouse+HD+Remake+%5BPSN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1982c5b9c56484c89d5713ddb63f8764978a0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,25,130,197,185,197,100,132,200,157,87,19,221,182,63,135,100,151,138,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
