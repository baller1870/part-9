It comprises of the Sun and the eight planets that go around it.\nThis issue of 'Tell Me Why' takes you on a journey into outer space, so that you can learn more about the fascinating planets in our solar system.\n'Tell Me Why' is a colourful monthly Indian knowledge magazine published by Manorama publications.
