His Hollywood legacy, captured in such screen adaptations as A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and Suddenly, Last Summer, reflects the sea change in American culture in the mid-twentieth century. Placing this body of work within relevant contexts ranging from gender and sexuality to censorship, modernism, art cinema, and the Southern Renaissance, Hollywood's Tennessee draws on rarely examined archival research to recast Williams's significance.\n\nProviding not only cultural context, the authors also bring to light the details of the arduous screenwriting process Williams experienced, with special emphasis on the Production Code AdministrationÃ¢â‚¬â€the powerful censorship office that drew high-profile criticism during the 1950sÃ¢â‚¬â€and Williams's innovative efforts to bend the code. Going well beyond the scripts themselves, Hollywood's Tennessee showcases findings culled from poster and billboard art, pressbooks, and other production and advertising material. The result is a sweeping account of how Williams's adapted plays were crafted, marketed, and received, as well as the lasting implications of this history for commercial filmmakers and their audiences.\n\nPublisher: University of Texas Press (November 16, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0292723040\nISBN-13: 978-0292723047\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nIn this rich, compelling, well-researched volume, Palmer and Bray show exactly how Hollywood dealt with Tennessee Williams and, in turn, how he often subverted the very authorities that sought (in vain) to keep him in check.
