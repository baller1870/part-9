Educated at Harvard, Princeton and Oxford, he served in the Israeli Army, Israeli Air Force, and British merchant navy.\n\nWhile Helprin's fictional works straddle a number of disparate genres and styles, he has stated that he &quot;belongs to no literary school, movement, tendency, or trend&quot;.  His first novel was REFINERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S FIRE (1977).  The 1983 novel WINTERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S TALE is a sometimes fantastic tale of early 20th century life in New York City and was adapted into a feature film by Akiva Goldsman.  He published A SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR in 1991.  MEMOIR FROM ANTPROOF CASE (1995) includes long comic diatribes against the effects of coffee.  FREDDY AND FREDERICKA (2005) is a satire based on Prince Charles and Princess Diana.  His latest novel, IN SUNLIGHT AND IN SHADOW (2012) has been described as an extended love song to New York City.\n\nHe has also published several books of short stories, including A DOVE OF THE EAST &amp; OTHER STORIES (1975) and THE PACIFIC &amp; OTHER STORIES (2004).\n\nHelprin's &quot;writer's manifesto&quot;, DIGITAL BARBARISM (2009) is a defense of authors' right to control their work and defend its integrity against appropriation and distortion by others.  He would not approve of this torrent.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* DIGITAL BARBARISM: A Writer's Manifesto (HarperCollins, 2009) -- PDF + ePUB\n\n* A DOVE OF THE EAST &amp; OTHER STORIES (Harcourt, 2005)\n\n* FREDDY AND FREDERICKA (Penguin, 2005) -- PDF\n\n* IN SUNLIGHT AND IN SHADOW (Harcourt, 2012)\n\n* MEMOIR FROM ANTPROOF CASE (Harcourt, 2007)\n\n* THE PACIFIC &amp; OTHER STORIES (Penguin, 2005)\n\n* REFINER'S FIRE: The Life and Adventures of Marshall Pearl, A Foundling (Harcourt, 2005)\n\n* A SOLDIER OF THE GREAT WAR (Harcourt, 2005)\n\n* WINTER'S TALE (Pocket Books, 1984)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
