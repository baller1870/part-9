To mark this historic anniversary, this series concentrates on two famous expeditions: Sir John Franklin's in 1845 and Roald Amundsen's in 1903. The stories are told using dramatic reconstructions, CGI and documentary techniques. Using new information, the film sheds light on what happened to Franklin's expedition and how Amundsen was able to succeed when so many before had failed.\n\nTimbuktu: once a desert trading post, it grew into a golden city with three &quot;universities&quot; and huge manuscript libraries that were founded some decades before Oxford and Cambridge in England. These universities were the seat of an African literary tradition that the West didn't even believe existed until recent times.\n\nIn a spellbinding journey, author Aminatta Forna - who grew up in Sierra Leone - travels to the beautiful landscapes of Timbuktu in a quest to discover Africa's oldest literature and find out why its preservation and understanding matters. Along the way, she meets the local people responsible for bringing it to world attention and questions just how different Africa might be if Timbuktu's literacy had flourished across the continent.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 51mn 44s 771ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 120 Kbps\nAspect            : 544 x 400 (1.360) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 123 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f0bed5a23fbcf1d4751384eb8a8edb3475c401","amp;dn":"BBC.The+Lost+Libraries+of+Timbuktu+%282009%29.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f0bed5a23fbcf1d4751384eb8a8edb3475c401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,240,190,213,162,63,188,241,212,117,19,132,235,138,142,219,52,117,196,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
