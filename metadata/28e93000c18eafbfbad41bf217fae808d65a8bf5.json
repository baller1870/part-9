Williams and Chad Hugo make up the record production duo The Neptunes, producing soul, hip hop and R&amp;B music. He is also the lead vocalist and drummer of rock, funk, and hip hop band N.E.R.D,  (the acronym of No one Ever Really Dies, stylized as N*E*R*D)  which he formed with Hugo and childhood friend Shay Haley. The band's sound generally contains elements of rock, funk and hip hop, while also encompassing R&amp;B and pop. They have been praised for their heavy use of electronic, bass and funk beats, while others have suggested that The Neptunes are unable to blend R&amp;B and rock.               \n\n\n        N.E.R.D.   -  She Wants To Move  (2004) \n        N.E.R.D.   -  Maybe  (2004)\n        N.E.R.D    -  Hypnotize U  (2010)\n        N.E.R.D.

It was written and produced by Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams (known collectively as The Neptunes).  &quot;Boys&quot; is a R&amp;B and hip hop song, including funk influences. The remix carries a slower tempo than the album version, and both versions are noted to be reminiscent of Janet Jackson. Some critics praised Williams and Spears' chemistry, as well as the production on the track, while others did not think the song worked well.While the song did not perform well on the Billboard charts in the United States, it reached the top ten on the Belgian charts and in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and charted in the top twenty in Australia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. The song would later be certified Gold in Australia. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for &quot;Best Video from a Film.&quot; \n      In March 2013, Pharrell appeared alongside T.I. on Robin Thicke's hit single &quot;Blurred Lines&quot;. The song has been a worldwide hit, has peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has also reached number one in 13 more countries including the United Kingdom and Germany, making it Pharrell's third Billboard Hot 100 number one single. On June 29, 2013, Pharrell became the 12th artist in the chart's history to simultaneously hold the number one and two positions with &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; and &quot;Get Lucky&quot; respectively\n     &quot;Get Lucky&quot; is a song by French house music duo Daft Punk, featuring Pharrell Williams and co-written with Nile Rodgers. It is the lead single from Daft Punk's fourth studio album &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;. Musically, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; is a disco song while lyrically, according to Pharrell Williams, the song is about the fortune of connecting with someone and not just about sexual chemistry. Following a leak days earlier, the single was released as a digital download on 19 April 2013. &quot;Get Lucky&quot; has since received acclaim from critics, and has spawned numerous cover versions and parodies. The single reached the top ten in the music charts of over 32 countries, and has sold more than 7.3 million copies as of September 2013. Since its release, &quot;Get Lucky&quot; has received critical acclaim from media outlets and music critics. Michael Cragg from The Guardian said the song &quot;eschews the crunching electronics of their last album and the vocoder-lead  future-disco of Discovery&quot;, and it was the &quot;best thing Pharrell Williams has been involved with for a long time&quot;. Pitchfork listed &quot;Get Lucky&quot; as a Best New Track, stating that the song's &quot;real elegance lies in the hands of Nile Rodgers&quot;. Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the single 5 stars and said although Daft Punk's &quot;creative methods may be unorthodox, the final result is a legal rush we can all enjoy&quot;. BBC Radio 1 host Annie Mac played &quot;Get Lucky&quot; on the day of its release, and gave it a positive review. She remarked that Daft Punk are not making electronic dance music, but rather &quot;real music to dance to&quot;. Music critic Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker wrote that Rodgers' performance in the song was &quot;as close to magic as pop comes.&quot;   Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes giving the song a four-star rating out of five, described it as &quot;an old-school disco jam&quot; and called it &quot;formidable&quot;.  Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also welcomed the song, she called it an &quot;intoxicating track&quot; and wrote it &quot;represents all thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right with electronic music.&quot;\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28e93000c18eafbfbad41bf217fae808d65a8bf5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+523","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28e93000c18eafbfbad41bf217fae808d65a8bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,233,48,0,193,142,175,191,186,212,27,242,23,250,232,8,214,90,139,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
