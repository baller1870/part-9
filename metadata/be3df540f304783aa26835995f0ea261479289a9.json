Gregg will also find out how they make 5,000 Fizzers a minute using a tablet pressing machine that uses three tonnes of pressure to create each sweet, and he meets the man in charge of making three quarters of a million Fruity Pop lollies every day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cherry Healey is let inside the research and development department and experiences for herself how hard it is to come up with a new product - plus she researches how the country youâ€™re from has an impact on the sweets you like. She also finds out how they put the letters in seaside rock and is given special access to the Fishermanâ€™s Friend factory in Lancashire to discover how a local family turned a niche product into a worldwide success.\r\n\r\nAnd historian Ruth Goodman investigates how sweets were first invented and discovers that, in the Middle Ages, they were used as a medicine and thought to reduce flatulence. Sheâ€™ll also find out about the human cost of Britainâ€™s sweet tooth in the 18th century and how an abolition movement instigated a sugar boycott which helped to end the slave trade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3df540f304783aa26835995f0ea261479289a9","amp;dn":"Inside.The.Factory.s02e05.Sweets.EN.SUB.x264.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3df540f304783aa26835995f0ea261479289a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,61,245,64,243,4,120,58,162,104,53,153,95,14,162,97,71,146,137,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
