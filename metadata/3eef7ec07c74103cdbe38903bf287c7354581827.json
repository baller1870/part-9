Le MÃƒÂ´mo, for violin and piano is a work of extremes, a ritual about exorcism and possession inspired by the works of visionary 20th Century shaman Antonin Artaud. Untitled, dedicated to Joseph Cornell, the hermetic New York artist whose delirious box constructions mix innocent nostalgia with uncomfortable personal obsessions, is a tour de force for solo cello brilliantly performed by Erik Friedlander. The piano trio Amour Fou explores loveÃ¢â‚¬â€obsessive love, mad love, doomed love in a compendium of moods ranging from BuÃƒÂ±uel to Bataille, Scriabin to Messiaen. A mysterious and romantic new direction from John Zorn.
