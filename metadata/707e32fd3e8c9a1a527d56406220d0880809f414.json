The nickname Sabicas is said to have come from his mispronunciation of the Spanish for beans, habas, to which was added a diminutive ending. A self-taught child prodigy, he made his professional debut at age 10 at a concert by the singer La Chelita in a theater in Madrid. Reviewers dubbed him a &quot;fenomeno&quot;, a compliment that followed him his whole life. He soon became an established artist; a book on flamenco from the 1930s describes him as one of the great guitarists of Spain.\nSabicas gained renown as a concert performer, often accompanying famous dancers; his career was for years linked with that of the great Carmen Amaya. A prolific recording artist, he made over fifty record albums, and helped spread the popularity of flamenco worldwide. He died in New York City in 1990.\nThe concert on this DVD was recorded live in a television studio in the late 1960s and includes: Malaguena, Zorongo (with dance by Los Duendes de Espana), Guadalquivir, Zapateado en Re, Siguiriya (with dance by Maria Alba), Sitio de Zaragoza, and Danza Arabe.\nDances performed and sung by Luis Vargas and accompanied by guitarist Adonis Puertas. Los Duendes de Espana includes dancers Sara de Luis, Orlando Romero, and Miguel Angel\n\n\nScreenshots:\nhttp://www.picamatic.com/view/3147778_uupJATjh0a/\nhttp://www.picamatic.com/view/3147781_Is1NX8jF76/\nhttp://www.picamatic.com/view/3147762_NjdLf1eAS5/\nhttp://www.picamatic.com/view/3147780_GUMLVAJ1n1/\n\nQuality: DVD5\nVideo: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000Kbps\nAudio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448Kbps\nDVDInfo:\nTitle:\nSize: 1.95 Gb ( 2 044 022 KBytes ) - DVD-5\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nVTS_01 :\n  Play Length: 00:00:07\n  Video: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nVTS_02 :\n  Play Length: 00:00:17\n  Video: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\n  Audio:\n      English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nVTS_03 :\n  Play Length: 00:31:00\n  Video: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\n  Audio:\n      English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nVTS_04 :\n  Play Length: 00:00:08\n  Video: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nMenu Video:\n      NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nMenu Subtitles:\n      Not specified\nMenu English Language Unit :\n      Root Menu\n\n\n***\nfrom Russia with love...)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707e32fd3e8c9a1a527d56406220d0880809f414","amp;dn":"Sabicas%3A+King+Of+The+Flamenco+Guitar+%5B2005%2C+Flamenco%2C+DVD5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707e32fd3e8c9a1a527d56406220d0880809f414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,126,50,253,62,140,154,26,82,125,86,64,98,32,208,136,8,9,244,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
