In The Good Soldiers,  Finkel shadowed the men of the US\n2-16 Infantry  Battalion in Baghdad  as they carried out  the grueling\nfifteen-month &quot;surge&quot;  that changed them  all forever. Now  Finkel has\nfollowed many of  the same men as they've returned  home and struggled\nto reintegrate  - both  into their  family lives  and into  society at\nlarge.\n\nIn the  ironically titled  Thank You for  Your Service,  Finkel writes\nwith tremendous compassion not just about the soldiers but about their\nwives and children.  Where do soldiers belong  after their homecoming?\nIs it  reasonable, or even  possible, to  expect them to  rejoin their\ncommunities as  if nothing has  happened? And in moments  of hardship,\nwho can soldiers turn to if they feel alienated by the world they once\nlived in?  These are  the questions  Finkel faces  as he  revisits the\nbrave but shaken men of the 2-16.\n\nMore than a work  of journalism, Thank You for Your  Service is an act\nof  understanding --  shocking  but always  riveting, unflinching  but\ndeeply humane, it takes us inside the heads of those who must live the\nrest of their lives with the realities of war.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17568768-thank-you-for-your-service&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17568768-thank-you-for-your-service&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSee also: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8252209/David_Finkel_-_The_Good_Soldiers.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8252209/David_Finkel_-_The_Good_Soldiers.&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b9043fedd94a005aed6d33a144f57be0215bc0","amp;dn":"David+Finkel+-+Thank+You+for+Your+Service+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b9043fedd94a005aed6d33a144f57be0215bc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,185,4,63,237,217,74,0,90,237,109,51,161,68,245,123,224,33,91,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
