Bringing together a potent mix of rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, southern rock, a dash of old-school punk attitude and an upbeat swing to their playing, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slow Motion DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth album and could well be the one to make those who arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aware sit up and notice.\n\nKicking into gear with lead-off single Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Night LongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite clear that this band are up for partying and, much like their energetic live shows, they want to take you with them. Easily as rollickingly catchy as anything by, say, Airbourne, the band donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rest on their laurels and carry on the energetic vibe with Ã¢â‚¬ËœDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Need YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a bouncy rocker with singer Seb switching from throaty roar in the verses to a clean, melodic chorus without sounding forced.\n\nSo far, so good but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on fourth track Ã¢â‚¬ËœFires of HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that the band change the pace and add a bit of groove into proceedings, creating a mid-paced stomper that brings to mind Black Label Society and also makes for an early album highlight.  The straight-ahead Ã¢â‚¬ËœShould Be RunningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ follows and brings back the AC/DC/Airbourne feel with a main riff that the Young brothers would surely approve of.  After the choppy aggression of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDusty DreamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the band drop in an acoustic piece entitled Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Life of aÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ that serves as an intro to Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦DrifterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a mid-paced rocker that sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd with a European accent. A bit of an odd combination but it works.\n\nThe final run of the album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite match up to the first part, with only the melodic hard rock of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAnnoyinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢noisyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ being anywhere near as memorable as those early tracks. The haunting title track rounds things out in a mellower mood than when the album began but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really come across as meaningful as the band probably think it does.\n\nOverall, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slow Motion DiseaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a good album that has a couple of excellent moments.  The rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll worship of AC/DC is great fun, and tracks like Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Night LongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ could easily give the band a hit if they can get the exposure, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the tracks that hold back on the party vibe a little where things get a bit more interesting. Definitely a band to keep an eye on. And I have and have posted they are good and deserve a second look. And thats almost it there is only one release left and its proving a little difficult to ,but grab I will.
