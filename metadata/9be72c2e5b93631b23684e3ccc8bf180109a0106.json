This concise introduction provides numerous code examples to help you explore Gradle, both as a build tool and as a complete solution for automating the compilation, test, and release process of simple and enterprise-level applications. \n Discover how Gradle improves on the best ideas of Ant, Maven, and other build tools, with standards for developers who want them and lots of flexibility for those who prefer less structure. \nUse Gradle with Groovy, Clojure, Scala, and languages beyond the JVM, such as Flex and C \nGet started building a simple Java program using GradleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s command line tooling and a small build script \nLearn how to configure and construct tasks, Gradle's fundamental unit of build activity \nTake advantage of Gradle's integration with Ant \nUse Gradle to integrate with or transition from Maven, and to build software more cleanly \nPerform application unit and integration tests using JUnit, TestNG, Spock, and Geb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9be72c2e5b93631b23684e3ccc8bf180109a0106","amp;dn":"Building+and+Testing+with+Gradle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9be72c2e5b93631b23684e3ccc8bf180109a0106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,231,44,46,91,147,99,27,35,104,78,60,204,139,241,128,16,154,1,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
