Especially with his contributions on albums like &quot;Planetary Duality&quot; and &quot;Autotheism&quot;. He left during the later album's cycle, presumably to write some music to really call his own.\n\nNow, he's fully able to do this in his new band Irreversible Mechanism. They've just released album &quot;Infinite Fields&quot; and it is INCREDIBLE. Yes, the caps lock was necessary because this is some next level material you're about to hear. And if you've already heard it, chances are you're just going to hit play again. This is easily one of the best Technical Death Metal releases of 2015 so far. \nersible Mechanism\n\nAlbum: Infinite Fields\nYear: 2015\n\nGenre: Technical Melodic Death Metal | Progressive Melodic Death Metal\nCountry: Belarus (Minsk)\n\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nLabel: Blood Music\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
