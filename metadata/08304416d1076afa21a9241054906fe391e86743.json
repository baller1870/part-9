It follows symbologist Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu as they investigate a murder in Paris's Louvre Museum and discover a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus having been married to Mary Magdalene. The title of the novel refers to, among other things, the fact that the murder victim is found in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, naked and posed like Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a pentacle drawn on his chest in his own blood.\n\nAuthor: Dan Brown\n\nOriginal language: English\n\nFormat: Pdf\n\nPreceded by: Deception Point\n\nFollowed by: The Lost Symbol\n\nThis torrent doesn't provide anything exceptional.Books in it are easily available in Internet.
