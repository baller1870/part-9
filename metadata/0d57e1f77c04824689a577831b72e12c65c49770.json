Chet Helms, a key mover and shaker in the West Coast counterculture, spoke for many when he hailed the Lloyd quartet as &quot;the first psychedelic jazz group.&quot; \n\n\n\n2 CDs, companion pieces recorded at the same concert:\n\nThe Charles Lloyd Quartet\nLove-In 1967\nJourney Within 1968\nRecorded live at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco\n\n\n\nFour-and-a-half decades after the event, saxophonist Charles Lloyd's Love-In, recorded live at San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium in 1967, the counterculture's West Coast music hub, endures as much as an archaeological artifact as a musical document.\n \nFrom sleeve designer Stanislaw Zagorski's treatment of Rolling Stone photographer Jim Marshall's cover shot, through the album title and some of the track titles Love-In's semiology reeks of the acid-drenched zeitgeist of the mid 1960s, a time when creative music flourished, and rock fans were prepared to embrace jazz, provided the musicians did not come on like their parents: juicers dressed in sharp suits exuding cynicism.\n\nFolk themes, Eastern influences, blues, modal hard bop, and impressionistic passages, a subtle hybrid of jazz-rock and free, pulsing styles, meld seamlessly into a unique, cohesive musical conception.\n \nOn Love-In, and on Journey Within recorded at the same concert that produced Love-In , everything was jazz for the Charles Lloyd Quartet, and what they made jazz from opened the music up to everybody who heard it. The album is a lasting testament to that cultural ecumenism.\n\n\n2 CDs / 2013 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nCD1 / Love-In:\n1. Tribal Dance \n2. Temple Bells \n3. Is It Really The Same? \n4.
