Furthermore, this is the first show of Rothko's painting after an\r\nalmost decade-long hiatus caused by extensive litigationâ€”court proceedings\r\nthat made it impossible until now to realize an exhibition or even to gain\r\naccess to a representative sampling of the artist's lifework from which a\r\nselection could be made","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32eba1703516d88c83a22d59f106353a3435064","amp;dn":"Mark+Rothko+-+A+Retrospective+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32eba1703516d88c83a22d59f106353a3435064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,46,186,23,3,81,109,136,200,58,34,213,159,16,99,83,163,67,80,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
