Systems and payers are facilitating it. Patients and providers are benefitting from it. Research is supporting it, and policymakers are demanding it.\n\nThe emerging field of Medical Family Therapy (MedFT) is contributing greatly to these developments and Medical Family Therapy: Advanced Applications examines its implementation in depth. Leading experts describe MedFT as it is practiced today, the continuum of services provided, the necessary competencies for practitioners, and the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of health that the specialty works to integrate. Data-rich chapters model core concepts such as the practitioner as scientist, the importance of context in health care settings, collaboration with families and communities, and the centrality of the relational perspective in treatment. And the book's wide-spectrum coverage takes in research, training, financial, and policy issues, among them:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Preparing MedFTs for the multiple worlds of health care\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extending platforms on how to build relationships in integrated care\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Offering a primer in program evaluation for MedFTs\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ensuring health equity in MedFT research\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Identifying where policy and practice collide with ethics and integrated care\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Recognizing the cost-effectiveness of family therapy in health care\n\nWith its sophisticated insights into the current state Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the future Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of healthcare reform, Medical Family Therapy: Advanced Applications is essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the fields of clinical psychology, counseling, family therapy, healthcare policy, psychiatric nursing, psychiatry, public health, and social work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c104459f97f893375e59c64f950ba7ccadb30f2c","amp;dn":"Medical+Family+Therapy+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c104459f97f893375e59c64f950ba7ccadb30f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,4,69,159,151,248,147,55,94,89,198,79,149,11,167,204,173,179,15,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
