The length of the war and differing\nopinions on what should be done to bring the war to an end has led to a\nsplintering of the groups involved. The controlling powers-that-be have\ndepleted arsenals and seemed to have exhausted all efforts of\ndiplomacy. Trapped in a stalemate, sub-factions have rebelled and\nbroken off the main alignments. Rebellion is upon us.\n\nThe ever-expanding conflicts within and between the TEC, Vasari, and\nAdvent have pushed the battlegrounds into uncharted space. The sectors\nnow being drawn into the war feature the most dangerous and powerful\nnatural phenomena in the galaxy.\n\nExploit what resources remain in these dangerous sectors while you can.\nThe uncharted depths of space hold threats beyond any natural\nphenomenon, and not all of them wait to be explored.\n\nThree new stars: Pulsars, black holes, and neutron stars pose unique\ndangers.\n\nSix deep space anomalies: Starship graveyards, antimatter fountains,\nand more contain both threats and opportunities.\n\n11 random events: Stars launch volatile gases that shut down orbital\noperations, mobile storms wreak havoc across the solar system, and\nconquered factions sense your weakness and seek to reclaim their\nworlds.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
