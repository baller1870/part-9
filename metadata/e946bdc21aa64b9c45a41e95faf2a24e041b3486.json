Hans Nieper&amp;#039;s amazing book Conversion of Gravity Field Energy - Revolution in Technology, Medicine and Society (1985) which brings together many unbelievable scientific achievements that are almost unknown to general public yet they will almost certainly have a revolutionary impact in the future. From sociology, geopolitics, medicine to technology and energy politics, this fascinating book covers a broad and partly already existing arena of applications that have to do with conversion of gravity field energy into usable energy for everyday use. As early as 1946, Nieper was critical of certain aspects of the predominant theories in physics since he was forced to listen to physics lectures in order to secure good seats for the subsequent medical lectures. In 1953 he developed a so-called shielding theory of gravitational effects and reintroduced the ether &quot;abolished&quot; by Einstein. The results of lunar orbiting by NASA satellites confirmed Dr. Nieper&amp;#039;s concept in principle. Only a small step remained for dr. Nieper to postulate the generation of unlimited, inexpensive power from the Tachyon-Field in space. Energy crisis, tachyon fields, N-machines for free energy, Nikola Tesla&amp;#039;s automobile, gravity energy, earthquakes, cures for many diseases of civilization - all this and more in short reports from many unknown scientific conferences or articles, discovered by authors the world has yet to hear from. Find out what has been going for decades outside the mainstream scientific circles and how it will profoundly affect the future of this civilization. 380 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e946bdc21aa64b9c45a41e95faf2a24e041b3486","amp;dn":"Nieper+-+Conversion+of+Gravity+Field+Energy+-+Revolution+in+Tech","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e946bdc21aa64b9c45a41e95faf2a24e041b3486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,70,189,194,26,166,75,156,69,164,30,149,250,242,162,78,4,27,52,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
