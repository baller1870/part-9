His father Renato was active within the Italian Communist Party and Gianni used to help him sell the party newspapers. At an early age Morandi worked as a shoe-shiner, cobbler and as a candy vendor in the village's only cinema.

He won the Festival of Sanremo in 1987, placed second in 1995 and third in 2000\n\nHe also played as actor in several TV series, as well as the host in popular Italian television shows.
