Added linkages to common medical diagnoses help support clinical reasoning, improve quality, and build the evidence needed to enhance nursing care.\n- Includes 15-20 high-frequency, high-cost medical diagnoses that are commonly experienced by patients across the life span.\n\n- Examples include Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Total Joint Replacement, and Asthma.\nNEW! Treatment of Intervention content makes information easier to locate by listing interventions as Major Interventions and Suggested Interventions.\nTwo NEW chapters discuss the use of linkages for clinical reasoning and quality improvement and the use of NNN in computerized information systems.\nNEW! Information associated with the risk for nursing diagnosis is contained on a single page for quick and easy reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d7a4045b129bddb82e6347b53a1105f929e9329","amp;dn":"NOC+and++NIC+Linkages+to+NANDA-I%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d7a4045b129bddb82e6347b53a1105f929e9329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,122,64,69,177,41,189,219,130,230,52,123,83,161,16,95,146,158,147,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
