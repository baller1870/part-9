An international arms dealer, she sells to anyone who&amp;#039;s got the connections and the cash...no questions asked.\nEn route to a secret rendezvous to meet her lover, Liberty answers her mobile phone.

If her line goes dead, she&amp;#039;ll detonate a bomb killing her and blowing a whole city block sky high.
