It is ideal for the non specialist and emergency physicians, Foundation doctors, trainee radiologists, and specialist trauma nurses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d12e1f59585f1a8ae4f0588b044335368102c0","amp;dn":"ABC+of+Imaging+in+Trauma+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d12e1f59585f1a8ae4f0588b044335368102c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,209,46,31,89,88,95,26,138,228,240,88,139,4,67,53,54,129,2,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
