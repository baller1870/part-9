It discusses the definition and classification of these disorders and the epidemiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); explores the approach to diagnosis and evaluation via methods such as echocardiography, right heart catheterization, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing; describes the major drug classes used to treat PAH and the cell signaling pathways that they target as well as adjunct and investigative therapies; and highlights special situations that are particularly challenging in the management of PAH. Written by experts in their respective fields, Diagnosis and Management of Pulmonary Hypertension is a valuable resource for pulmonologists, cardiologists, and practitioners in internal medicine and critical care","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52dd76def2e126c02e9e49ce8da357f010a7e9be","amp;dn":"Diagnosis+%26amp%3B+Management+of+Pulmonary+Hypertension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52dd76def2e126c02e9e49ce8da357f010a7e9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,221,118,222,242,225,38,192,46,158,73,206,141,163,87,240,16,167,233,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
