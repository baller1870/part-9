But in a very religious and conservative region of Darshan her passion is considered intolerable depravity and a sign of unacceptable morals for a young girl from a good family. When her father organizes a forced marriage to Phoree, a wealthy artisan, Dyssery takes control of her life and sets off an adventure through the Valley of Shadows where sheÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll meet, among other things, vampires, zombies, mummies and an obscene incubus named ZeblÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Âª\n\nThe Shadowrealm of Troy is a one-shot set in the Darshan region of Troy thousands of years before Lanfeust's adventures. It's a totally stand-alone adventure that doesn't require any additional reading.\n\nenjoy\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2504905938ff1ca0ac79fcf61026fcc8adb83af7","amp;dn":"The+Shadowrealm+of+Troy+%28One+Shot%29+%28fixed%29+%282011%29+%28Alice%29cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2504905938ff1ca0ac79fcf61026fcc8adb83af7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,4,144,89,56,255,28,160,172,121,252,246,16,38,252,200,173,184,58,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
