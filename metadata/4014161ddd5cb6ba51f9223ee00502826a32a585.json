Happiness\n\nReview:\nThis is a strong album, but in all honesty, doesn't have as much immediacy as 'How to Save a Life'.\n\nFor me, &quot;Say When&quot; is a standout track. The Fray have a really great sound, a good 'feel' and reasonably unique sense of melody. Vocals are warm and intimate. Their sound is unchanged from their previous album which I like! This is a great album, but I take off a star as I still believe their previous album is even better with more strong tracks.\n\n(you know what I mean, the test is, when you're driving, you'll be skipping tracks more than you did on the old album!) - at least that's how I found it)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4014161ddd5cb6ba51f9223ee00502826a32a585","amp;dn":"The+Fray+-++Fray+%5B2009%5D+-+P0w3rp0t1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4014161ddd5cb6ba51f9223ee00502826a32a585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,20,22,29,221,92,182,186,81,249,34,62,224,5,2,130,106,50,165,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
