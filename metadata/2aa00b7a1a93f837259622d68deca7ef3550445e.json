In a scene where the BND investigator probes Benjamin's house, two Fight Club posters can be seen hanging on the wall. One poster shows the iconic bar of soap, the other includes pictures of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.

Also The Hague has no real Metro system, just 'trams' that stay above ground except for the few stops between Central Station and Grote Markt Straat.
