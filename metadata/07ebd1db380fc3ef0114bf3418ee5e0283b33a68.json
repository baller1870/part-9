The most momentous of wars has begun in the heart of the Sacred Lands. Four factions - the Empire, the Mountain Clans, the Undead Hordes and the Legions of the Damned - stand ready for battle as they fight for the survival and dominance over their war-torn world, and the gods they have long believed in.\n\nThe Mighty Lords watch silently as their Disciples prepare for the daunting tasks ahead. Each warrior must engage in a struggle of swordplay, sorcery, and uncommon courage in order to complete their sacred quests. The Empire fights to secure their people's future; The Mountain Clans search to regain their rune knowledge; The Undead Hordes seek revenge for their accursed god; and The Legions of the Damned battle to resurrect their fallen angel's soul. It is a struggle of desperation.\n\nEvery stroke of a sword, each blast of fiery magic must be endured beyond exhaustion. For once the clouds of destruction clear, lands will have been transformed, new armies will have been forged and the cheers of the liberated will resound throughout the land.\n\nThe day of reckoning has come... Only one side shall claim victory. Only the chosen will survive.\n\n\nIf you like it,support the companies and GOG.com please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07ebd1db380fc3ef0114bf3418ee5e0283b33a68","amp;dn":"Disciples+-+Sacred+Lands+Gold+%282001%29+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07ebd1db380fc3ef0114bf3418ee5e0283b33a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,235,209,219,56,15,195,239,1,20,191,52,24,238,94,2,131,179,58,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
