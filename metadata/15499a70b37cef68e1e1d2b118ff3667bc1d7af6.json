The unique features of the first edition like news of recent discoveries, biographical sketches of mathematicians, and applications--like the use of congruence in scheduling of a round-robin tournament--are being refreshed with current information. More challenging exercises are included both in the textbook and in the instructor's manual.\n\nElementary Number Theory with Applications 2e is ideally suited for undergraduate students and is especially appropriate for prospective and in-service math teachers at the high school and middle school levels.\n\n* Loaded with pedagogical features including fully worked examples, graded exercises, chapter summaries, and computer exercises\n* Covers crucial applications of theory like computer security, ISBNs, ZIP codes, and UPC bar codes\n* Biographical sketches lay out the history of mathematics, emphasizing its roots in India and the Middle East\n\n\nA review\n========\n\n&quot;This is the only number theory book to show how modular systems can be employed to create beautiful designs, thus linking number theory with both geometry and art. It is also the only number theory book to deal with bar codes, Zip coes, International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), and European Article Numbers (EAN)...\n\nEach section provides a wealth of carefully prepared, well-graded examples and exercises to enahnce the readers' understanding and problem-solving skills.&quot; \n-ZENTRALBLATT MATH \n\n\nAbout the Author\n================\n\nThomas Koshy, Ph. D., is Professor of Mathematics at Framingham State College, Framingham, Massachusetts. He received Faculty of the Year Award in 2007. He is the author of seven books and numerous articles on a wide spectrum of topics. His &quot;Fibonacci and Lucas Numbers with Applications,&quot; published by Wiley, won the Association of American Publishers' new book award in 2001.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0080547095&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://books.google.co.in/books?isbn=0080547095&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15499a70b37cef68e1e1d2b118ff3667bc1d7af6","amp;dn":"Elementary+Number+Theory+with+Applications+%282e%29+-Thomas+Koshy.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15499a70b37cef68e1e1d2b118ff3667bc1d7af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,73,154,112,179,124,239,104,225,225,210,177,24,255,54,103,188,29,122,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
