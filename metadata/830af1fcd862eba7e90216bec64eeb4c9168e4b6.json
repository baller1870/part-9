It asks one simple question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how will you die? \n\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their continued survival relies on their own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.\nCurrent Features\n\n    Hardcore Sandbox Zombie Survival Game with a focus on realistic survival.\n    Online multiplayer survival with persistent player run servers.\n    Hundreds of zombies with swarm mechanics and in-depth visual and hearing systems.\n    Full line of sight system and real-time lighting, sound and visibility mechanics.
