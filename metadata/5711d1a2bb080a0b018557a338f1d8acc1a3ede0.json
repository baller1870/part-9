This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nShort Cuts (1993)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108122&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108122&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Robert Altman. \nWith Andie MacDowell, Bruce Davison, Jack Lemmon, Julianne Moore, Anne Archer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Downey Jr., Madeleine Stowe\n\n IMDb rating:7.7/10   17,649 votes  \n\nThe everyday lives of a number of Los Angeles residents are the subject of this loosely-knitted collection of short stories.\n\nMasterpiece.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5711d1a2bb080a0b018557a338f1d8acc1a3ede0","amp;dn":"Short.Cuts.1993.DVDrip.H264%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5711d1a2bb080a0b018557a338f1d8acc1a3ede0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,17,209,162,187,8,10,11,1,133,87,163,56,241,216,172,193,163,237,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
