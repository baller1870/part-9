Taylor then turns down a group trip to Paris in order to spend time with her daughter. The rest of the ladies, however, jet off to the City of Lights for fun and fireworks. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re worried, however, when Kim is late then acts increasingly strange, in a way reminiscent of her life before rehab. Lisa and Ken also take a side trip to San Tropez, where they reunite with Ken's grown son and his much-older wife, who was once a friend of Lisa's.\n\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf39c3fb1efd2870154ec0b51439868194908e97","amp;dn":"The+Real.Housewives.Of.Beverly.Hills.S03E15.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf39c3fb1efd2870154ec0b51439868194908e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,57,195,251,30,253,40,112,21,78,192,181,20,57,134,129,148,144,142,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
