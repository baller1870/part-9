The evidence was minimal at best for them to claim this was a hoax. But now, 100 some years since its first public appearance, the Protocols seem to becoming a reality. Consider this - the IMF - thats the International Monetary Fund for those who happen to NOT know, is headed and ran by 90% Jews....\n\nI dare you all to compare todays happenings with the world economic crisis and how the IMF is stepping in forcing these debt ridden and crumbling nations to use &quot;Austerity Measures&quot; (i.e. stopping and halting funding to all programs that help the poorest and most desperate people within a country)to pay the IMF back for loans it had made. Compare the protocols written over 100 years ago to the world events today and you may notice the same odd and strange thing I did...that some of these protocols are becoming a reality, and its being spear-headed by an organization ran by 90% jews....\n\n\nOddly enough these protocols that were written over 100 years ago, whether by Anti-Semetics or by extreme Zionist Jews, are coming to fruition, and this must be addressed. Read, learn, compare, and decide for yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46aa72623a3080ebc666bb58b1d46d463f394f08","amp;dn":"Protocols+of+the+Learned+Elders+of+Zion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46aa72623a3080ebc666bb58b1d46d463f394f08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,170,114,98,58,48,128,235,198,102,187,88,177,212,109,70,63,57,79,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
