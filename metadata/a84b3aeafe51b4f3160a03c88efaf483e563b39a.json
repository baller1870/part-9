The credit crunch has shown how the global financial system has become increasingly dependent on mathematical models trying to quantify human (economic) behaviour. Now the quants are at the heart of yet another technological revolution in finance: trading at the speed of light.\n\nWhat are the risks of treating the economy and its markets as a complex machine? Will we be able to keep control of this model-based financial system, or have we created a monster?\n\nA story about greed, fear and randomness from the insides of Wall Street.\n\nDirector: Marije Meerman\nResearch: Gerko Wessel\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my &quot;Best of Noam Chomsky&quot; Video:\nhttp://vimeo.com/7344978\nor all my uploads on &quot;SuperBayForum&quot;:\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=62897\n\n..i wish u aLL the best and hope that you will seed this torrent a little bit..\n\n..theArchit3kt..\n\n\n!! keep torr3nts alive !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a84b3aeafe51b4f3160a03c88efaf483e563b39a","amp;dn":"Documentary+%7E+The+Alchemists+of+Wall+Street+%5BtheArchit3kt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a84b3aeafe51b4f3160a03c88efaf483e563b39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,75,58,234,254,81,180,243,22,10,3,200,142,250,244,131,229,99,179,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
