At the same time we find out that Hank Mcoy is a local high school football hero, and Warren wants to use his wings to help fight crime.\n\nUnfortunately the tide has turned against mutant kind and the Angel finds himself up against a mutant killing robot, who during a chase ends up crumpling mysteriously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6f47146dd69733a8c793db43788aeeb411b3234","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+Children+of+the+Atom+%28001+-+006%29+%281999+-+2000%29+%28Digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6f47146dd69733a8c793db43788aeeb411b3234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,244,113,70,221,105,115,58,140,121,61,180,55,136,174,235,65,27,50,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
