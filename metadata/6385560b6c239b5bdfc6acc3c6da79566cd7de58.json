It was released on November 23, 1999. The record was the first official Guns N' Roses release since &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; released on the same day in 1993. Former guitarist Slash notes that the album is &quot;not pretty and there are a lot of mistakes, but this is Guns N' Roses, not the fucking Mahavishnu Orchestra. It's as honest as it gets.&quot;\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nDisc one \t\nNo. \t\t\n1. &quot;Nightrain&quot;  \t                                                      5:18\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)Las Vegas, USA; January 25, 1992\n\n2. &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;  \t                                                      5:42\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)London, UK; August 31, 1991\n\n3. &quot;It's So Easy&quot;  \t                                                      3:28\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987) Paris, France; June 6, 1992\n\n4. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; \t                                              5:09\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)Buenos Aires, Argentina; 1992 \n\n5. &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;  \t                                                      5:05\n(from Use Your Illusion I, 1991)New York City, USA; May 16, 1991\n\n6. &quot;My Michelle&quot;  \t                                                      3:53\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)London, UK; August 31, 1991\n\n7. &quot;You're Crazy&quot;  \t                                                      4:45\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)Tokyo, Japan; December 10, 1988\n\n8. &quot;Used to Love Her&quot;  \t                                                      4:17\n(from G N' R Lies, 1988)Tokyo, Japan; December 10, 1988\n\n9. &quot;Patience&quot;  \t                                                              6:42\n(from G N' R Lies, 1988)Mexico; April 24, 1993/Tokyo,Japan; February 22, 1992\n\n10. &quot;It's Alright&quot;\t                                                      3:07\n(Black Sabbath cover)Houston, USA; September 4, 1992 \n\n11. &quot;November Rain&quot;\t                                                      12:29\n(from Use Your Illusion I, 1991)Tokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n\nDisc two \t\nNo. \t\n1. &quot;Out ta Get Me&quot;  \t                                                      4:33\n(from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)London, UK; June 28, 1987\n\n2. &quot;Pretty Tied Up&quot; (from Use Your Illusion II, 1991)\t                      5:25\nTokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n3. &quot;Yesterdays&quot; (from Use Your Illusion II, 1991)\t                      3:52\nLas Vegas, USA; January 25, 1992 \n\n4. &quot;Move to the City&quot; (from Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide, 1986)\t              8:00\nTokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n5. &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; (from Use Your Illusion II, 1991)\t              6:02\nTokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n6. &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; (from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)\t                      8:27\nLas Vegas, USA; January 25, 1992 \n\n7. &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; (from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)\t              7:25\nParis, France; June 6, 1992 \n\n8. &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot;(Dylan cover from Use Your Illusion II, 1991)   7:27\nLondon, UK; April 20, 1992\n\n9. &quot;Don't Cry&quot; (from Use Your Illusion I, 1991)\t                              4:44\nTokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n10. &quot;Estranged&quot; (from Use Your Illusion II, 1991)\t                      9:52\nTokyo, Japan; February 22, 1992 \n\n11. &quot;Paradise City&quot; (from Appetite for Destruction, 1987)\t              7:21\nLas Vegas, USA; January 25, 1992 \n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6385560b6c239b5bdfc6acc3c6da79566cd7de58","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+%281999%29+Live+Era+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6385560b6c239b5bdfc6acc3c6da79566cd7de58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,133,86,11,108,35,155,91,223,198,172,195,198,218,121,86,108,215,222,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
