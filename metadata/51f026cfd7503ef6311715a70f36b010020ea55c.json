The album was recorded in various Brooklyn studios throughout the fall of 2011, with mixing sessions taking place in the early months of 2012 and the finishing touches being handled by Bat for Lashes producer Dan Carey in London. Apart from a broad range of hallucinatory experiments with synthesizers and effects pedals by the band, special guests were called in to augment the cracked pop songs, including Kishi Bashi on strings and a kalimba overdub from Nomo's Elliot Bergman.
