In Almereyda&amp;#039;s vampire film Nadja, the dead travel fast, and the ancient and the modern exist side-by-side in his Hamlet. As Almereyda speaks about Eggleston&amp;#039;s photographs, he discusses the work as &quot;hiding in plain sight,&quot; &quot;familiar and strange, recognizable and indelible,&quot; &quot;a part of a thing can reflect a whole, a wider truth,&quot; &quot;an unbalanced emotion between fear and love&quot; It&amp;#039;s a personal, revealing take on Eggleston. Almereyda shows the distance between spectator and subject during a climactic interview with Eggleston where the filmmaker asks the artist to discuss the work in terms of a paradox. The artist shakes his head, perhaps annoyed, muttering, &quot;That doesn&amp;#039;t make any sense to me.&quot;  - Jeremiah Kipp, Slant Magazine\n\nEncoded with Nero Recode, Standard 2-pass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd593145957299e8ff672cd5d0ed166947c57e92","amp;dn":"William+Eggleston+in+the+Real+World+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd593145957299e8ff672cd5d0ed166947c57e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,89,49,69,149,114,153,232,255,103,44,213,208,237,22,105,71,197,126,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
