The problem I had with this is that they didn't include the final verse of The Hero's Return (still not available on CD). I therefore took it upon myself to add it to the sequencing. Because of the connecting soundscapes and overlapping music I could not put it exactly where it belongs in the running order (after The Gunner's Dream), instead sticking it between the album sides. I've also included the single versions of a couple of songs as extras.\n\n01 The Post War Dream\n02 Your Possible Pasts\n03 One Of The Few\n04 When the Tigers Broke Free\n05 The Hero's Return Part 1\n06 The Gunner's Dream\n07 Paranoid Eyes\n08 The Hero's Return Part 2\n09 Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\n10 The Fletcher Memorial Home\n11 Southampton Dock\n12 The Final Cut\n13 Not Now John\n14 Two Suns in the Sunset\n\nBonus:\n\n15 The Final Cut radio advert\n16 Not Now John (obscured version)\n17 Not Now John (edit)\n18 The Hero's Return Parts 1 &amp; 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4fa8c4b389de50d98130d0fb81c99ea8e66bf1","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Final+Cut+%28expanded+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4fa8c4b389de50d98130d0fb81c99ea8e66bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,79,168,196,179,137,222,80,217,129,48,208,251,129,201,158,168,230,107,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
