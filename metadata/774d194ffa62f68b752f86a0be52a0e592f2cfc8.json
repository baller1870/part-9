In another, a young woman, in the aftermath of an unusual and humiliating seduction, reacts in a clever if less-than-admirable fashion. Other stories uncover the Ã¢â‚¬Å“deep-holesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a marriage, the unsuspected cruelty of children, and how a boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disfigured face provides both the good things in his life and the bad. And in the long title story, we accompany Sophia KovalevskyÃ¢â‚¬â€a late-nineteenth-century Russian ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© and mathematicianÃ¢â‚¬â€on a winter journey that takes her from the Riviera, where she visits her lover, to Paris, Germany, and, Denmark, where she has a fateful meeting with a local doctor, and finally to Sweden, where she teaches at the only university in Europe willing to employ a female mathematician.\n\nWith clarity and ease, Alice Munro once again renders complex, difficult events and emotions into stories that shed light on the unpredictable ways in which men and women accommodate and often transcend what happens in their lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:774d194ffa62f68b752f86a0be52a0e592f2cfc8","amp;dn":"Too+Much+Happiness+-+Alice+Munro.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"774d194ffa62f68b752f86a0be52a0e592f2cfc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,77,25,79,250,98,246,139,117,47,134,160,190,82,160,229,146,242,207,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
