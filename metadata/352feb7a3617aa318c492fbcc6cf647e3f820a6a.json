I have named the actual files as the \n\nsong names but they still come up as 'audiotrack1' etc.. in media player.\n\nThey were just ripped to my laptop as the 3 separate dics with no track names\n\nSo ive gone through listening what everything is, renamed them and put them as one.\n\nIm sure you can manage to tag them as you see fit because im tired of it now! aha\n\n\nIt was an amazing show, the welsh humor battling with Dallas Green's was amusing.\n\n\nTotal duration 1 hour 44 min approx\n\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n\n1. We Found Each Other in the Dark \n\n2. The Death of Me \n\n3. Waiting... \n\n4. The Grand Optimist \n\n5. As Much as I Ever Could \n\n6. Weightless \n\n7. Day Old Hate \n\n8. Body in a Box \n\n9. What Makes a Man? \n\n10. The Girl \n\n11. Little Hell \n\n12. Sleeping Sickness \n\n13. Fragile Bird \n\n14. Sorrowing Man \n\n15. Comin' Home \n\n16. Sometimes (I Wish)\n\n\n\nYeah this file took ages to put together, utter pain. But its such a great show!\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352feb7a3617aa318c492fbcc6cf647e3f820a6a","amp;dn":"City+and+Colour+Live+in+Europe+-+Cardiff%2C+Wales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352feb7a3617aa318c492fbcc6cf647e3f820a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,47,235,122,54,23,170,49,140,73,47,188,198,207,100,126,63,130,10,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
