During the 1980s and 90s he was a member of the Argentine Rock group Soda Stereo, along with Charly Alberti and Zeta Bosio. In the early 90s, with Amor Amarillo, he pursued a solo career.\n\nArtist: Gustavo Cerati and Daniel melero\nYears active: 1992.\nCountry: Argentina.\nAlbum: Colores Santos\nGenre: Pop, Electropop, Electro, Techno.\n\nGustavo Cerati (Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Keyboards, MPC-60)\nDaniel Melero (Vocals, Synth, Emulator)\nFlavio Etcheto (Trumpet in 'Madre Tierra')\nCarola Bony (Vocals in 'Pudo Ser' and 'Colores Santos').\n\nReview by Allmusic: Gustavo Cerati and Daniel Melero made this album while Soda Stereo was still a group at the peak of its popularity. That was two years after the release of Cancion Animal, in which Daniel Melero, a local techno pioneer, was a major contributor. Certainly you won't find anything here that sounds like what Soda Stereo had done at that time. The result is an experimental pop album with an electronic touch. Somehow this album was like a UFO in the Argentine early-'90s rock scene. Featuring mainly songs, there are also some instrumental pieces like the danceable &quot;Quatro,&quot; &quot;Madre Tierra,&quot; and &quot;Alborada.&quot; All of the tracks were written by the duo, expect &quot;La Cuerda Planetaria&quot; by Melero and &quot;Tu Medicina,&quot; a song that Cerati dedicated to his father, who died a few months before the album was recorded. &quot;Cozumel,&quot; &quot;Hoy Ya No Soy Yo,&quot; and &quot;Vuelta por el Universo&quot; stand as the best songs of an even album. Ideal for seekers of new approaches to the pop world, it also shows the roots of the roads that Soda Stereo and Gustavo Cerati were going to travel later.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Vuelta Por el Universo (6:03)\n02 Marea de Venus (4:25)\n03 Cozumel (3:37)\n04 Quatro (5:10)\n05 Pudo Ser (5:26)\n06 Hoy Ya No Soy Yo (4:09)\n07 La Cuerda Planetaria (4:57)\n08 Madre Tierra (4:30)\n09 Tu Medicina (4:40)\n10 Alborada (2:49)\n11 Colores Santos (4:47)\n\n--\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron.
