So when his wife of forty-two years leaves him, he decides to return to the village where he was stationed in search of the happiness heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been missing since he left. But what he finds is not what he expected. The school he built is a ruin, the church and clinic are gone, and poverty and apathy have set in among the people. \n\nThey remember Ellis and welcome him with open arms. Soon, however, their overtures turn menacing; they demand money and refuse to let him leave the village. Is his new life an escape or a trap? \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TherouxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bravely unsentimental novel about a region where he began his own grand career should become part of anybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s education in the continent.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Washington Post\n\n &quot; Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Lower RiverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is riveting in its storytelling and provocative in its depiction of this African backwater, infusing both with undertones of slavery and cannibalism, savagery and disease. Theroux exposes paternalism in HockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Peace Corps nostalgia, his Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsense of responsibility, almost a conceit of ownership.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ That sense of responsibility, and HockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s modest contribution to the welfare of a people he was once genuinely fond of, has been replaced by a harsher mode of operation, run by coldhearted contractors living apart in impregnable compounds. Ã¢â‚¬ËœI have to leave,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Hock pleads. Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going home.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ To which the village headman replies, with chilling menace, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis is your home, father.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ &quot; -- New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f681f06647ff15256a860c6386ecd1c94de12d3","amp;dn":"Paul+Theroux+-+The+Lower+River","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f681f06647ff15256a860c6386ecd1c94de12d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,104,31,6,100,127,241,82,86,168,96,198,56,110,205,28,148,222,18,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
