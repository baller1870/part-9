Her discovery of Pope John Paul II's &quot;Theology of the Body&quot; revealed to her the fullness of God's plan for sex and marriage, and led to a dramatic renewal of her marriage and her faith. Patty now speaks around the country about the challenges she faced on her amazing journey.\n\nFiletype: MP3\nLength: 01:08:12\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/prove-it-god-and-he-did&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/prove-it-god-and-he-did&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSee also:\n\n--Contraception: Cracking the Myths by Professor Janet Smith\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10505510&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10505510&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--Green Sex: The Case for Natural Family Planning by Jason Evert\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10184609&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10184609&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n--Sexual Freedom by Christopher West\n  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10177794&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10177794&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
