It made Tutankhamun the most famous name in ancient Egyptian history.  But the real story has become shrouded in myth, and exact circumstances of Tutankhamun's life and death remain an unknown.\n\nThis two hour special brings together the latest evidence from a team of archaeologists, anatomists, geologists, and Egyptologist to build the ultimate picture of Tutankahmun.  They investigate what was unusual about this burial - why it seems he was buried in a hurry, and what analysis of his mummy and the artifacts in the bomb can tell us about his life and death.\n\nUltimate Tut offers a 21th century approach to ancient history, blending 3D graphics, stylized reconstruction, and a rollicking forensic investigation.  Basted on genuinely new scientific research, the film will present fresh insights into how Tutankhamun was buried, why his tomb was the only one to remain intact, and the enduring mystery around how he died.\n\nSource: Retail DVD\nLength: 1:50:14\nSize: 740MB\nContainer: mp4\n\nVideo\nCodec: H264\nResolution: 720x480 (widescreen)\nFrame rate: 29.97\n\nAudio\nCodec: MPEG AAC\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo (2)\nBitrate: 160kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9afee20d4a6c3e7bcea05dc23e2963bf150c81de","amp;dn":"PBS+Secrets+of+the+Dead+-+S12E05+-+Ultimate+Tut+%5BDVDrip%5D...Ctige","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9afee20d4a6c3e7bcea05dc23e2963bf150c81de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,254,226,13,74,108,62,123,206,160,93,194,62,41,99,191,21,12,129,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
