His family had a long-running seafaring tradition, one factor which influenced his writings. As a boy, Jules Verne ran off to be a cabin boy on a merchant ship, but was caught and returned to his parents.\nIn 1847 Jules was sent to study law in Paris. While there, his passion for theatre grew. Later in 1850, Jules Verne's first play was published. His father was outraged when he heard that Verne was not going to continue law, and refused to continue to cover Verne's expenses in Paris. This forced Verne to make money by selling his stories.\nAfter spending many hours in Paris libraries studying geology, engineering, and astronomy, Jules Verne published his first novel Five Weeks in a Balloon. Soon after he started writing novels such as Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\nFrom there, Jules Verne went on to become one of the most prolific authors of his time, publishing well over 50 novels, several non-fiction titles, as well as various short stories, poems, plays, and songs. Along with H. G. Wells, Verne is considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern science fiction. The last novel before Verne's death in 1905 was The Invasion of the Sea.\n\nAll files are mp3 format\nbetween 32.0 and 64.0 Kbps\nat 22.05 to 24.00 KHz\n1 Channel Mpeg audio\n\nTorrent consists of:\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\nA Journey to the Center of the Earth\nAn Antarctic Mystery\nAround the Moon\nAround the World in 80 Days\nChildren of Captain Grant\nDick Sands the Boy Captain\nEight Hundred Leagues on the Amazon\nFive Weeks in a Balloon\nFrom the Earth to the Moon\nMaster of the World\nThe Fur Country\nThe Mysterious Island\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03d1d8ecf4a6fd05283d2cd199c693dcf926db63","amp;dn":"Massive+Jules+Verne+Audiobook+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03d1d8ecf4a6fd05283d2cd199c693dcf926db63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,209,216,236,244,166,253,5,40,61,44,209,153,198,147,220,249,38,219,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
