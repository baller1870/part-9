Even after the release of the new films, the talented artists at Dark Horse have continued to expand the depth and breadth of the Star Wars galaxy. From ancient Jedi to alien worlds, from fantastic creatures to faster-than-light spaceships, no other publisher has produced so many dazzling images from our generation's greatest mythology. This book presents an amazing selection of covers and interior images from over a decade of Dark Horse comics and graphic novels by some of the finest artists in the world. \n\nA visual feast for anyone who has enjoyed the films and a true treasure for the dedicated Star Wars fan!\n\n\nDescription (Volume 2):\n\nFrom 5,000 years before Luke Skywalker first picked up a lightsaber to nearly 150 years after the events in Return of the Jedi, Dark Horse Comics has chronicled the major events in every era of the Star Wars galaxy in amazing drawings and paintings by some of the most accomplished artists in our own galaxy. In this all-new companion to the first Star Wars Panel to Panel volume, we've spotlighted not only the stunning work of comics' greatest artists, but also the legion of characters Dark Horse has contributed to Star Wars' Expanded Universe - characters who have not only carried the romance and adventure of the galaxy far, far away far beyond the events in the films, but those who have made the jump from the pages of comic books to television and the silver screen! \n\nEvery Star Wars fan will cherish this look back, forward and beyond!\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Star Wars - Dark Empire (I-III) (#001-014):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9052671&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9052671&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - State of Decay OST (2013) - Jesper Kyd:\n                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8704814&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6d9aed778d296ad72b7ba5b4a54de7dcda8d6d6","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Panel+to+Panel+%28Vol.+1-2%29+%5B2004-2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6d9aed778d296ad72b7ba5b4a54de7dcda8d6d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,217,174,215,120,210,150,173,114,183,186,91,74,84,222,125,205,168,214,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
