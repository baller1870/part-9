Founding group members Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael formed the group after performing in an early incarnation called The Jackson Brothers, which originally consisted of a trio of the three older brothers. Active from 1966 to 1990, the Jacksons played from a repertoire of R&amp;B, soul, pop and later disco. During their six-year Motown tenure, The Jackson 5 were one of the biggest pop-music phenomena of the 1970s[1], and the band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, the latter brother later transforming his early Motown solo fame into greater success as an adult artist.\n\nThe Jackson 5 were the first act in recording history to have their first four major label singles (&quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot;, and &quot;I'll Be There&quot;) reach the top of the American charts. Several later singles, among them &quot;Mama's Pearl&quot;, &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Dancing Machine&quot;, were Top 5 pop hits and number-one hits on the R&amp;B singles chart. Most of the early hits were written and produced by a specialized songwriting team known as &quot;The Corporation&quot;; later Jackson 5 hits were crafted chiefly by Hal Davis, while early Jacksons hits were compiled by the team of Gamble and Huff before The Jacksons began writing and producing themselves in the late-1970s.\n\nSignificantly, they were the first black teen idols to appeal equally to white audiences thanks partially to the successful promotional relations skills of Motown CEO Berry Gordy. Upon their departure from Motown for CBS in 1976, The Jacksons were forced to change their name and replace Jermaine (who remained at Motown) with younger brother Randy. After two years under the Philadelphia International Records label, they signed with Epic Records and asserted control of their songwriting, production, and image, and their success continued into the 1980s with hits such as &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot; and &quot;State of Shock&quot;. Their 1989 album 2300 Jackson Street was recorded without Michael and Marlon. Michael and Marlon did appear, however, on the title track. The disappointing sales of the album led to the group being dropped by their record label at the end of the year. The group has never formally broken up, but has been dormant since then, although all five brothers performed together at two Michael Jackson tribute concerts in September 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthology 1976 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Rereleased 1986\n\n\nAnthology was originally released as a triple-album set by legendary Motown family unit, The Jackson 5, in 1976. It was at this point that most of the Jacksons (with the glaring exception of Jermaine Jackson) had left the label to join CBS Records. Motown president Berry Gordy once said that the Jackson 5 were &quot;the last superstars to come off the Motown assembly line&quot;; after the group left the label, Motown would not have another act to equal its success until Boyz II Men in the 1990s.\n\nLater repackagings of Anthology have compiled it as a double compact disc set. The most recent re-release, issued by Motown in 2000, was repackaged in 2005 as Jackson 5: Gold\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\n\n1986 Double CD release\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.\tI Want You Back \n2.\tABC \n3.\tDon't Know Why I Love You \n4.\tI'll Be There \n5.\tThe Love You Save \n6.\tI Found That Girl \n7.\tMama's Pearl [Single Version] \n8.\tWho's Lovin' You \n9.\tGoin' Back To Indiana \n10.\tNever Can Say Goodbye \n11.\tSugar Daddy \n12.\tMaybe Tomorrow \n13.\tLookin' Through The Windows \n14.\tLittle Bitty Pretty One \n15.\tTeenage Symphony \n16.\tCorner Of The Sky \n17.\tSkywriter \n18.\tHallelujah Day \n19.\tThe Boogie Man \n20.\tI Am Love \n\n\n\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n1.\tI Hear A Symphony \n2.\tGet It Together [single version] \n3.\tDancing Machine [Dancing Machine version] \n4.\tWhatever You Got, I Want \n5.\tI Was Made To Love Her [Slightly different version] \n6.\tAll I Do Is Think Of You \n7.\tBody Language (Do The Love Dance) \n8.\tForever Came Today \n9.\tGot To Be There (Michael Jackson) \n10.\tRockin' Robin (Michael Jackson) \n11.\tI Wanna Be Where You Are (Michael Jackson) \n12.\tBen (Michael Jackson) \n13.\tWe're Almost There (Michael Jackson) \n14.\tJust A Little Bit Of You (Michael Jackson) \n15.\tThat's How Love Goes (Jermaine Jackson) \n16.\tLove Don't Wanna Leave (Jackie Jackson) \n17.\tDaddy's Home (Jermaine Jackson) \n18.\tLet's Get Serious (Jermaine Jackson) \n19.\tYou're Supposed To Keep Your Love For Me (Jermaine Jackson) \n20.\tLet Me Tickle Your Fancy (Jermaine Jackson\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78f045ba60970ca860e0b6dc18b7362c44513fee","amp;dn":"Jackson+5+-+Anthology+1976+%28Greatest+Hits+2+CD%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78f045ba60970ca860e0b6dc18b7362c44513fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,240,69,186,96,151,12,168,96,224,182,220,24,183,54,44,68,81,63,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
