The team, assembled by Cosmo from Guardians of the Galaxy as the last wish of Star-Lord, includes Cosmo, Silver Surfer, Quasar, Ronan the Accuser, Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator and Ikon the Space Knight. The team's first mission is to deal with the threat of the Dire Wraiths.\n\nThe second story/series is &quot;Rocket Raccoon and Groot&quot;, a duo adventure of this fan favorite buddy team, also from Guardians of the Galaxy. This series was originally to sport covers by original Rocket Raccoon 1985 miniseries artist Mike Mignola, and it still does, but sadly only as limited variants.\n\n\nPart of marvel's cosmic line\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/annihilators/49-39231/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/annihilators/49-39231/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.comics.ign.com/articles/115/1153281p1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.comics.ign.com/articles/115/1153281p1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comics.cosmicbooknews.com/content/review-annihilators-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comics.cosmicbooknews.com/content/review-annihilators-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nAnnihilators 01 (of 04).cbz 42.2 MB\nAnnihilators 02 (of 04).cbz 41.1 MB\nAnnihilators 03 (of 04).cbz 44.5 MB\nAnnihilators 04 (of 04).cbz 42.1 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6418b92dba13711df81c3238943d48660389214d","amp;dn":"Annihilators+%282011+series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6418b92dba13711df81c3238943d48660389214d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,24,185,45,186,19,113,29,248,28,50,56,148,61,72,102,3,137,33,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
