The album was produced by Bob Marlette, who, according to Lips, contributed a lot to songwriting skills and arrangements. The whole album was written by Lips and Rob alone. In some songs Lips was inspired by his love of heavy &quot;rock'n'roll&quot;, which made him feel he &quot;found his way home&quot; to the time when they did their first record, Hard 'n' Heavy. Hope in Hell was released on May 24, 2013 in Germany, May 27 in the rest of Europe and May 28 in North America.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n    2 Release and reception\n    3 Personnel\n    \nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Hope in Hell&quot;   \t4:43\n2. \t&quot;Eat Your Words&quot;   \t3:41\n3. \t&quot;Through with You&quot;   \t4:48\n4. \t&quot;The Fight Is Never Won&quot;   \t4:28\n5. \t&quot;Pay the Toll&quot;   \t2:48\n6. \t&quot;Flying&quot;   \t4:50\n7. \t&quot;Call of Duty&quot;   \t3:53\n8. \t&quot;Badass Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \t4:35\n9. \t&quot;Time Shows No Mercy&quot;   \t4:35\n10. \t&quot;Mankind Machine&quot;   \t4:13\n11. \t&quot;Shut the Fuck Up&quot;   \t3:38\nbonus tracks (on all releases except the German SPV - Steamhammer CD) \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n12. \t&quot;Hard Wired&quot;   \t3:08\n13. \t&quot;Fire at Will&quot;   \t4:03\nTotal length:\n\t53:20 \t\nadditional Japanese bonus track \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n14. \t&quot;Hope In Hell [live]&quot;                                                    Personnel\n\nAnvil:\n\n    Lips - vocals &amp; guitar\n    Robb Reiner - drums\n    Sal Italiano - bass\n\nProduction:\n\n    Bob Marlette - Producer, Mixer\n    Maor Appelbaum - Mastering Engineer .......seed it if you get it ........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41951ed59f174b371f3444e57e1695f45e3ebbe1","amp;dn":"Anvil-Hope+In+Hell+%28Limited+Edition%29++mp3++320k++a2k+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41951ed59f174b371f3444e57e1695f45e3ebbe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,149,30,213,159,23,75,55,31,52,68,229,126,22,149,244,94,62,187,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
