His meticulously painted cloud-filled skies, bowler-hatted men, and\noversized household objects have had a profound influence on the art of the twentieth century. This is not a pipe, he wrote beneath his precisely realistic painting of a pipe, proposing the simple notion that a representation of a pipe and a pipe itself are not one and the same.\nThis book provides the reader with an introduction to the world of Magritte's magic realism, reproducing in color 63 of his most important works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4b71b68919949408132bd56ff1847e3f00701a5","amp;dn":"Magritte+%28Great+Modern+Masters+-+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4b71b68919949408132bd56ff1847e3f00701a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,183,27,104,145,153,73,64,129,50,189,86,255,24,71,227,240,7,1,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
