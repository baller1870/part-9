The projects are both classic and stylish, incorporating clever combinations of textured stitches and design details.\n\nEach of the fifteen patterns is designed in a one-of-a-kind way, focusing on knitting sideways or in an untraditional direction rather than the usual top-down or bottom-up construction. Knitting at different angles gives the projects unique shaping and fashion-forward silhouettes.\n\nLearn new techniques for knitting sideways and every-which-way and make fifteen contemporary, wearable patterns with Knitting Off the Axis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d848fad939aa404566419f9da51889e1d67cda6c","amp;dn":"Knitting+off+The+Axis%3A+Sideways+Knitting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d848fad939aa404566419f9da51889e1d67cda6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,72,250,217,57,170,64,69,102,65,159,157,165,24,137,225,214,124,218,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
