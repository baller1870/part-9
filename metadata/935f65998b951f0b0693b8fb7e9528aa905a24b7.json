Yet JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius was not immediately recognized, nor was his success easily won. At twenty-two he chose a life of exile; he battled poverty and financial dependency for much of his adult life; his out-of-wedlock relationship with Nora Barnacle was scandalous for the time; and the attitudes he held toward Ireland, England, sexuality, politics, Catholicism, popular cultureÃ¢â‚¬â€to name a fewÃ¢â‚¬â€were complex, contradictory, and controversial.\n\nIn James Joyce, Gordon Bowker, draws on material recently come to light and reconsiders the two signal works produced about JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€Herbert GormanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authorized biography of 1939 and Richard EllmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magisterial tome of 1959. By intimately binding together the life and work of this singular artist, Bowker gives us a masterful, fresh, eminently readable contribution to our understanding both of JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personality and of the monumental opus he created.\n\nBowker goes further than his predecessors in exploring JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inner depthsÃ¢â‚¬â€his ambivalent relationships to England, to his native Ireland, and to JudaismÃ¢â‚¬â€and uncovers revealing evidence. He draws convincing correspondences between the iconic fictional characters Joyce created and their real-life models and inspirations. And he paints a nuanced portrait of a man of enormous complexity, the clearest picture yet of an extraordinary writer who continues to influence and fascinate more than a century after his birth.\n\n\nPaperback: 656 pages\nPublisher: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; Reprint edition (June 11, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0374533822\nISBN-13: 978-0374533823\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935f65998b951f0b0693b8fb7e9528aa905a24b7","amp;dn":"James+Joyce+-+A+New+Biography+By+Gordon+Bowker+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935f65998b951f0b0693b8fb7e9528aa905a24b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,95,101,153,139,149,31,11,6,147,184,251,126,149,40,170,144,90,36,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
