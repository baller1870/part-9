They often overlook the importance of seismological knowledge to earthquake-proofing of design. It is not enough only to understand the anatomy of the structure, you must also appreciate the nature of the likely earthquake.\nSeismic design, as detailed in this book, is the bringing together of Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology. It focuses on the seismological aspects of design ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ analyzing various types of earthquake and how they affect structures differently. Understanding the distinction between these earthquake types and their different impacts on buildings can make the difference between whether a building stands or falls, or at least to how much it costs to repair.\nCovering the basis and basics of the major international codes, this is the essential guide for professionals working on structures in earthquake zones around the world.\n\nAbout the Author\nVictor Gioncu is Professor for Structural Design at the &quot;Politechnica&quot; University of Timisoara.\nFederico M. Mazzolani is Professor of Structural Engineering at the University of Naples &quot;Federico II&quot;, Italy.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 584 pages\nPublisher: Spon Press; 1 edition (September 17, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0415465338\nISBN-13: 978-0415465335\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71aa457a3820b51e96fa39ffd7f9c468175bc914","amp;dn":"Earthquake+Engineering+for+Structural+Design%2C+Gioncu%2C+Mazzolani","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71aa457a3820b51e96fa39ffd7f9c468175bc914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,170,69,122,56,32,181,30,150,250,57,255,215,249,196,104,23,91,201,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
