Focusing on ten topics in cancer biology for which there have been major changes in fundamental understanding, the authors provide a concise overview of the principles of each topic, followed by presentation of clinical cases illuminating the topic and detailed discussions. Summaries and key teaching points are highlighted at the end of each chapter to facilitate quick recall and review. The chapter authors are established translational experts in the biology being discussed as well practicing master clinicians.\n\nCancer Biology Review is a useful tool for any oncology clinician in training or preparing for boards, and for the oncology practitioner preparing for recertification or who sees the need to be more fully conversant in the current science of the field as clinically applied.\n\nFeatures of Cancer Biology Review include:\nPresents principles of cancer biology through clinical translations and therapeutic perspective\nClinical cases illustrate scientific principles as the clinician will observe them in practice\nEmphasis on scientific basis of current and emerging therapeutics\nLeading translational scientists/clinicians provide current, authoritative discussions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd1d7cb2dea7063bd9a31eab529504937ff1fcc","amp;dn":"Cancer+Biology+Review%2C+A+Case-Based+Approach+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd1d7cb2dea7063bd9a31eab529504937ff1fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,209,215,203,45,234,112,99,189,154,49,234,181,41,80,73,55,255,31,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
