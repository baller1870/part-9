They were formed by Roman Sayenko, prolific metal musician, the leading member of Hate Forest, Dark Ages and Blood of Kingu; Thurios, the leading member of Astrofaes and, with Sayenko, a former member of Hate Forest; and Yuriy Synytsky, of Lucifugum (session drummer) and Definition Sane. Their lyrical contents embrace Slavic mythology, seasons and poetry. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets, especially Taras Shevchenko.\n\nDrudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums. They have also disavowed radical politics.\n\nFrom their conception until 2009, Drudkh did not have any official website, but in May 2009 Season of Mist launched an official Myspace, operated not by bandmates, but by workers of the label.\n\nYear: 2003 - 2014\nCountry: Ukraine, Kharkiv\nGenre: Black Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 247 - 320Kbps\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:\n2003 - Forgotten Legends\n2004 - Autumn Aurora\n2005 - The Swan Road\n2006 - Blood in Our Wells\n2006 - Songs of Grief and Solitude\n2007 - Anti-Urban [EP]\n2007 - Estrangement\n2009 - Microcosmos\n2010 - Handful of Stars\n2010 - Slavonic Chronicles [EP]\n2012 - Eternal Turn of the Wheel\n2012 - Thousands of Moons Ago The Gates [Split]\n2014 - Eastern Frontier In Flames","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94e7371f4d3493490e0a0ec5baca892a357d994","amp;dn":"Drudkh+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%282003+-+2014%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94e7371f4d3493490e0a0ec5baca892a357d994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,78,115,113,244,211,73,52,144,224,160,236,91,172,168,146,163,87,217,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
