It is the first Magnetic Fields album to have its original release with Merge Records. Its title, lyrics and musical styling are a nod to country music, though the songs of Stephin Merritt remain rooted in classic pop and synthesizers. Virtually every song deals with roads and travel - and several songs' lyrics implicitly reference vampires.\nThe title of the album comes from a quote by J. B. Jackson, 1959: &quot;Let us hope that the merits and charm of the highway strip are not so obscure but that they will be accepted by a wider public.&quot;\nThis is the group's first full album in which songwriter Merritt also takes lead vocals.\nThe album was released on vinyl for the first time on May 6, 2008, via Merge Records, the first appearance of any Magnetic Fields album on vinyl.\nArcade Fire covered &quot;Born on a Train&quot; during a live performance on the KCRW program Morning Becomes Eclectic.\nLush covered &quot;I Have the Moon&quot; as a single B-side, and in the Japanese/Canadian released album Topolino.\nThe song &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; was used during an episode of the television series version of This American Life (&quot;Pandora's Box&quot;).\nRating 8/10\n\nTracklist:\n01 Lonely Highway.flac\n02 Long Vermont Roads.flac\n03 Born On A Train.flac\n04 I Have The Moon.flac\n05 Two Characters In Search Of A Country Song.flac\n06 Crowd Of Drifters.flac\n07 Fear Of Trains.flac\n08 When The Open Road Is Closing In.flac\n09 Sunset City.flac\n10 Dust Bowl.flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA \nGenre: Indie\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~751-948 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c7f9ba7a1b9e348d261a1c5edc9dba3f0c711dc","amp;dn":"%281994%29+The+Magnetic+Fields+-+The+Charm+Of+The+Highway+Strip+%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c7f9ba7a1b9e348d261a1c5edc9dba3f0c711dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,127,155,167,161,185,227,72,210,97,161,197,237,201,219,163,240,199,17,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
