We need critical knowledge that helps us to navigate the controversies and contradictions of this complex digital media landscape. Only then can we make informed judgements about what's happening in our media world, and why.\nShowing the reader how to ask the right kinds of questions about social media, Christian Fuchs takes us on a journey across social media, delving deep into case studies on Google, Facebook, Twitter, WikiLeaks and Wikipedia. The result lays bare the structures and power relations at the heart of our media landscape.\n\nThis book is the essential, critical guide for all students of media studies and sociology. Readers will never look at social media the same way again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d440468bac88d9bd515b0854ea2e8fe4b0b00ac","amp;dn":"Social+Media-+A+Critical+Introduction+%5BEpub%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d440468bac88d9bd515b0854ea2e8fe4b0b00ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,68,4,104,186,200,141,155,213,21,176,133,78,162,232,254,75,11,0,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
