As had been the case in other countries during the same year, here too the anti-globalisation protests had been met with heavy police presence. Yet nothing was to prepare the temporary inhabitants of the Diaz school Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most of them young men and women from all over Europe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for what was to happen. Shortly after midnight, the police stormed the school and brutally attacked these young people for two hours until almost all of them ended up in hospital and were later taken to a detention centre. To justify their actions, the police planted Molotov cocktails in the building. By the end of the G8 summit, one individual had lost their life. Told from different perspectives, the camera describes the events of this day, sticking close to the heels of both perpetrators and targets, until the whole bloody truth is told.\n\nRip Specs\n\nGeneral           : 5rFF-diaz.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 685 Kbps\nLength            : 1.36 GiB for 1h 55mn 53s 640ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 484 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 304 (2.368) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1934234/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1934234/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Italian | German | French | English | Spanish\nSubtitles: English\n\nPosted originally at KG by exvet, whom we thank\n\nDaniele Vicari - Diaz Don't Clean Up This Blood (2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f02df67d2146e857754075b094ec74208832262","amp;dn":"Daniele+Vicari+-+Diaz+Don%27t+Clean+Up+This+Blood+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f02df67d2146e857754075b094ec74208832262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,2,223,103,210,20,110,133,119,84,7,91,9,78,199,66,8,131,34,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
