The first seven episodes were broadcast from April to June 2011, beginning with &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot; and ending with mid-season finale &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot;. The final six episodes aired from August to October, beginning with &quot;Let's Kill Hitler&quot; and ending with &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;. The main season was preceded by &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, the 2010 Christmas special. The season was led by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, alongside executive producers Beth Willis and Piers Wenger. Sanne Wohlenberg, Marcus Wilson, and Denise Paul served as producers. The series is the sixth to air following the program's revival in 2005, and is the thirty-second season overall.\n\nNOTE: I made the decision to place 'A Christmas Carol' with the other episodes televised in 2010, so find it in the season 5 (2010) torrent.\n\n\nEpisode Synopses courtesy of:\n\nThe On-line TV Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans\nwww.thetvdb.com\n\n\n2011-04-23 - The Impossible Astronaut (1) (Video:H264 1280x720, 2964kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 191kbps)\n\nLocation: Utah, Washington D.C., Florida\nDate: 2011, 1969\nEnemies: The Silence\n\nPlacing his life entirely in their hands, the Doctor agrees to search for the recipient of the fourth envelope - just who is Canton Everett Delaware the Third?
