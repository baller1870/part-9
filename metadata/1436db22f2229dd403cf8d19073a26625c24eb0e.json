In the case of, narrator/soldier John Tyree and college student Savannah Lynn Curtis, harmony seems whole worlds away. While Savannah volunteers for Habitat for Humanity, John circles bars at last call, looking for new hookups. She's an affluent, idealistic do-gooder; he's an outsider trying to rehabilitate himself. Despite their values and lifestyle conflicts, the pair begin to converge. Then the random lightning of history snaps them apart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1436db22f2229dd403cf8d19073a26625c24eb0e","amp;dn":"Dear+John+-+Nicholas+Sparks-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1436db22f2229dd403cf8d19073a26625c24eb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,54,219,34,242,34,157,212,3,207,141,25,7,58,38,98,92,36,235,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
