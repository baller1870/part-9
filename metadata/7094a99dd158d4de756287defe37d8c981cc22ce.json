The two coaches met in a title fight on April 27, 2013 at UFC 159. This move drew criticism from MMA critics and fans, as many felt that Sonnen, who had previously lost his last match and not competed in the UFC Light Heavyweight division in years, had not done enough to earn a title shot.\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 720 x 480 (16:9 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7094a99dd158d4de756287defe37d8c981cc22ce","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Fighter+17+-+Team+Jones+vs+Team+Sonnen+%28HDTV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7094a99dd158d4de756287defe37d8c981cc22ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,148,169,157,209,88,212,222,117,98,135,222,254,55,216,201,129,204,34,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
