The album was released by Capitol Records on July 15, 1973 (see 1973 in music) and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America a little over a month after its release.[1] Two singles were released from the album. The first single, &quot;We're an American Band&quot;, was released on July 2, 1973 and the second, &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, was released on October 29, 1973.[2] Both singles were sung by drummer Don Brewer.\n\nThe album cover was originally covered in gold-colored foil on the outside, and the initial run of pressings were pressed in clear, dark-yellow vinyl. The album has been reissued many times and is currently available in the Compact Disc format. A Quadraphonic mix of the album was available in the Quadraphonic 8-Track cartridge format.\n\nThe album is #200 of the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) Definitive 200 albums of all time.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:333c6401e66dca09b68c781e1e5efed5ff26e814","amp;dn":"Grand+Funk+Railroad+-+We%27re+An+American+Band+%282014%29+%5BMini+LP+PT-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"333c6401e66dca09b68c781e1e5efed5ff26e814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,60,100,1,230,109,202,9,182,140,120,30,30,94,254,213,255,38,232,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
