It was written by John Lennon, and credited to Lennon and McCartney. The song first appeared on the various artists' charity compilation album No One's Gonna Change Our World in December 1969, and later, in different form, on Let It Be, the group's final released album.\n\nOne night in 1967, the phrase &quot;words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup&quot; came to Lennon after hearing his then-wife Cynthia, according to Lennon, &quot;going on and on about something.&quot; Later, after &quot;she'd gone to sleepÃ¢â‚¬â€and I kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream,&quot; Lennon went downstairs and turned it into a song. He began to write the rest of the lyrics and when he was done, he went to bed and forgot about them.\n\nThe flavour of the song was heavily influenced by Lennon's and the Beatles' interest in Transcendental Meditation in late 1967 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ early 1968, when the song was composed. Based on this he added the mantra &quot;Jai guru deva om&quot; to the piece, which became the link to the chorus. The Sanskrit phrase is a sentence fragment whose words could have many meanings. Literally it approximates as &quot;glory to the shining remover of darkness,&quot; and can be paraphrased as &quot;Victory to God divine&quot;, &quot;Hail to the divine guru&quot;, or the phrase commonly invoked by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in referring to his spiritual teacher &quot;All Glory to Guru Dev.&quot;\n\nIn his 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon referred to the song as perhaps the best, most poetic lyric he ever wrote: &quot;It's one of the best lyrics I've written. In fact, it could be the best. It's good poetry, or whatever you call it, without chewin' it. See, the ones I like are the ones that stand as words, without melody. They don't have to have any melody, like a poem, you can read them.&quot;\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapJcaAfl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MapJcaAfl&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7500kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
