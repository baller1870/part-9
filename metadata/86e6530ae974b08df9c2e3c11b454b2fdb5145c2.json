In wartime and peace, along major routes and minor, steam, diesel and electric trains have moved goods, taken commuters to work or families on holidays - a constant presence in an always-changing way of life. A Century of Railway Travel tells the story of one hundred years of Britain's railway heritage using striking full-page imagery with commentary from bestselling author Paul Atterbury. He explains the controversial history and unique appeal of the railways, and his expert eye steers the reader from the heyday of steam to the tragedy that was Beeching and rail's recent revival. The book stops to consider the great steam engines, the drivers, luggage, passengers, postcards, tickets, station scenes and carriage interiors we all remember so fondly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e6530ae974b08df9c2e3c11b454b2fdb5145c2","amp;dn":"A+Century+of+Railway+Travel+%28History+Photo+Ebook%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e6530ae974b08df9c2e3c11b454b2fdb5145c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,230,83,10,233,116,176,141,249,194,227,193,27,69,75,47,219,81,69,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
