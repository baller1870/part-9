An illuminating and useful book for anyone coping with the pressures of work.\n\nIn Reclaiming the Fire, Dr. Steven Berglas analyzes the rises and falls of corporate executives, middle managers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and others as they struggle to handle the trappings of successful careers. How does one deal with encore anxiety, the monotony of having to use talents that are no longer psychologically rewarding? Why is it that our national obsession with wealth traps people in careers that often lead them to wonder, &quot;Is that all there is?&quot; And why do highly successful people often set themselves up for disastrous falls?\n\nDr. Berglas answers all these questions and many more in this groundbreaking book by discussing real people whose careers have left them feeling pressured, burdened, and jaded.\n\nIn his most progressive and striking contribution to the literature on career success, Dr. Berglas debunks the persistent myth that women suffer more stress and burnout than men. He disproves the common claim that women involved both in careers and in family life suffer from trying to have it all, and he demonstrates how the drive to form close interpersonal ties a drive that is intrinsic to women can actually prevent both men and women from experiencing burnout. In a related analysis of the mentoring process, Dr. Berglas shows why it is more important for careerists to build legacies for future generations (a process he terms generativity) than to become obsessed with their own personal success. He proves that the process not only benefits the student but provides the mentor with psychological satisfaction and even improved physical health.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a34f27e0e338d095613f2fb02b42d8ee705d69b","amp;dn":"Reclaiming+the+Fire%3A+How+Successful+People+Overcome+Burnout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a34f27e0e338d095613f2fb02b42d8ee705d69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,52,242,126,14,51,141,9,86,19,242,251,2,180,45,142,231,5,214,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
