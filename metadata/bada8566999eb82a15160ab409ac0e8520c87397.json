Had an 8px bar of blur at the bottom and 6px of \nfade and artifacts running up and down the left side.\n\n\nResulting file info:\n\n474x352 (4:3)\nXviD @ 1025kbps, 23.976 FPS\nMP3 @ CBR 48kbps TS, 22kHz\n\n\nOriginally airing over the course of a year, 52 episodes straight, I have\ndivided the series by story arc (previously released - heavily edited -\nas movies), which roughly follow their respective book.\n\nA1 - The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (episodes 1 to 17)\nA2 - The Marvelous Land of Oz (episodes 18 to 30)\nA3 - Ozma of Oz (episodes 31 to 41)\nA4 - The Emerald City of Oz (episodes 42 to 52)\n\nNaming uses Arc # (A1-A4), and then series Episode # (E01-E52), since,\nconventionally, they are all S01, or a mini-series. Hopefully this isn't\noverly confusing for anyone.\n\n\nNote: I am no expert but I am pleased with the quality maintained here.\nThe video quality is virtually the same between the FLV and XviD files.\nI tried the conversion from FLV to XviD a number of ways with different\nprograms; this was my best result, and also has proper filesizing. If\nthere is anyone who is knowledgeable about proper encoding/transcoding,\nfiltering and restoration techniques for cartoons and would like to try,\nplease contact me and I will provide the original FLVs.\n\n\nCheers!\n\nosmosis/grenole","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bada8566999eb82a15160ab409ac0e8520c87397","amp;dn":"The+Wonderful+Wizard+Of+Oz+%281987+Animated+Series%29+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bada8566999eb82a15160ab409ac0e8520c87397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,218,133,102,153,158,184,42,21,22,10,180,9,172,14,133,32,200,115,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
