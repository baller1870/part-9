Out of his compelling urge to know what happened, and why the Jews went to their deaths apparently without resistance, has come this overpowering documentary novel. By tracking down and interviewing the widespread survivors of Treblinka, we now have a true story that has shaken and stunned the world.\n\n Nearly a million Jews were consumed by the ovens of Treblinka before August 2, 1943. On that day 600 prisoners armed with stolen guns and grenades attacked the Nazi guards, burned the camp, and fled into the nearby Polish forests. Of these, forty survived to bear witness to man's courage in the face of the greatest evil human history has produced. \n Treblinka is an incredible recreation of the human elements of the Holocaust. It portrays real, historical people who as innocent victims and against all odds, not only stayed alive but were able to organize a suicidal uprising, with the sole objective being the successful escape and survival of just a few human beings, in order to bear witness and testify to the hell and death of the infamous Treblinka. This is the most important literary piece that one could find. This book will shock and infuriate you, but ultimately you will find it to be about hope and life. It is a must read for anyone who wants to be an additional witness to the most horrific chapter in the history of our world! This is one of those rare treasures that is truly capable of positively influencing one's life! \n\nAbout the author:\nJean-FranÃƒÂ§ois Steiner is a French writer born February 17, 1938 in Paris.
