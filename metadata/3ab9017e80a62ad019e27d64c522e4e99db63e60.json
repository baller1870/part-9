ScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open-ended graphical patching system and diverse set of modules give you access to a new customizable processing environment capable of a very broad range of effects.\n\nScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tactile workflow and vast sonic potential will inspire you to push the envelope, while its flexible architecture invites you to try imaginative new routing scenarios to explore endless possibilities. Use it to generate vivid electronic tones and textures or to process your drum loops, soft synths, sound effects and external hardware.\n\nAt the heart of Scope, you will find a selection of modules you can freely configure by populating up to 8 slots. Once populated with a module, a slot will give you access to up to 4 input and output nodes, which you can freely connect via ScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtual patch cables. Inputs and Outputs are configured to have the ability to send and receive multiple signals at once, making very complex modulation scenarios possible. Scope ships with 26 modules ranging from effects to utility, with additional modules already planned for future updates.\n\nScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique workflow and interface will change the way you think about modulation and signal processing. The plugin makes it possible to set up completely self generating patches, making it equally capable as a sound generator and effects processor. Our designers have included a variety of external and internally generated effects patches to show what the plugin is capable of. To get you started, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve included 160 patches by Subjex, Balkansky, Thomas Hennebert, Apparition, Daed, John Black, Shiro Fujioka and Blush Response.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbracing all things modular, Scope includes a Eurorack modular synthesizer sample library comprised of over 1500 samples. We worked with 6 of the best module manufacturers to put together the Eurorack system used to generate all the content. Our goal was to create a functional counterpart to Scope; something you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easily achieve with a computer that interacts well with the plugin and gives you a new palette of sounds to work with right out of the box. Focused on the darker side of modular synthesis, sound designer Ivo Ivanov created a collection of compelling effects that are equally distinctive and indicative of the depth of EurorackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prodigious sonic landscape.\n\nCrafted with a combination of analogue and digital modules, ScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s library is packed with gritty and intricate synthesizer sounds in the form of hits, stabs, glitches, one shots and asymmetrical passages you can use to create your own rhythms, basslines, percussive elements and much more. To give you a true sense of the modular sound, the library features raw samples with no further processing. Import the sound effects into your favorite DAW or sampler and process, stretch, bend and twist them into something truly unique. To show you how the samples can be integrated into your projects, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve included loops by sound designers Ivo Ivanov, Thomas Hennebert, Apparition and Daed.\n\nINTELLIJEL:\n\nA Canadian based rag tag team of engineers, university professors, music makers and synth geeks.
