This was encoded with most x264 settings set at or above developers maximum recommended settings. For example, the motion estimation method was transformative-exhaustive (tesa) with a CRF value of 18, which is the max recommended for non-HD sources. All nine subtitle tracks are soft-coded and selectable.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using CRF encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f74352f5340fd7e914e5730f63cd1d96b74965b","amp;dn":"High+School+High+%281996%29+%5B576p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f74352f5340fd7e914e5730f63cd1d96b74965b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,116,53,47,83,64,253,126,145,78,87,48,246,60,209,217,107,116,150,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
