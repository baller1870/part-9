There is an opening section on Herge himself and how Tintin developed over forty-odd years.  Any fan of Tintin must read this book. It supplies answers to questions you'd never think of and opens you to a whole new side of the hero and his creator.  The amount of detail is incredible. Each chapter averages 10 pages, and although there are a lot of pictures and photographs from the Tintin books and other sources, there is also a lot of text, including:\n\n- A synopsis of each story. \n\n- The historical background for each story.\n\n- Detailed discussions about the characters with explanations of how many of them become members of &quot;the Tintin family.&quot;\n\n- Discussions of where HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© found inspiration for stories, characters, locations, machines and other items that made their way into the drawings. There are often pictures from HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s files shown side-by-side with the resulting drawings.  \n\n- Some of the Tintin adventures were revised and produced in new versions. For example, most of the stories that were originally in black and white were re-released in color, and sometimes revised once more later. The various versions of each story are compared to see what was changed. \n\n- Although the English version of this book is primarily focused on the English versions of the Tintin books, there are many discussions of what was changed from the original French versions to the English translated versions. \n\n- An analysis of HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s development as an artist and storyteller, from fairly primitive drawings and political naivety to sure artistic style and worldly understanding and finally political cynicism. \n\n- Information about how HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s life was influenced by his work with Tintin. \n\n- Similarly, there is information about how the Tintin stories were influenced by and reflected HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s private life. \n\n- HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s habit of putting himself and his friends into the stories. \n\n- Occasional mistakes made by HergÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. \n\n- A comprehensive index. \n\nIf you set out to read this book then you should have a complete collection of the Tintin books in English at hand. And be warned: You will end up spending many, many days before you finally put this book aside. That's because you'll pick up a Tintin adventure to check up on something Michael Farr says about it, and end up reading the whole Tintin book before you return to &quot;Tintin - The Complete Companion&quot;.
