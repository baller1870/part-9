But Ms. Dearie began her career as a bona fide jazz pianist and singer. She first was heard in 1951 as the female answer voice on King Pleasure's be-bop vocalise &quot;Moody's Mood For Love&quot; and, beginning in 1957, recorded a series of LPs for Verve, of which OOH-LA-LA was the second. Then as now, what impresses most about Blossom Dearie is her fresh sound--light but not delicate, funny, swinging and lyrical when called for.\n\nWhat might be come off in a lesser talent as a cute schoolteacher routine--Miss Crabtree painting the town a shade of red--is offset by honest musicianship and a real schoolteacher's attention to the English language as spoken. Dearie is one of the greatest lyric interpreters the music world has ever known. Every performance here is a little gem; the Cole Porter title tune receives its definitive performance, sexy as hell, and unknown Dearie treats like &quot;They Say It's Spring&quot; and &quot;Try Your Wings&quot; are just plain sweet and lovely.\n\nTracklist\n1.
