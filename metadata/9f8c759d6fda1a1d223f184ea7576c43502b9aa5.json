Madsen is inexperienced, but enthusiastic; when he gets a hunch of a crime syndicate of black market trade he hunts the story head-first, much to the discomfort of his more conservative newspaper colleagues. However, as Madsen uncovers new elements of the story an older colleague catches interest, and together they venture into the dark side of the big city. Meanwhile, Bjarne's brother returns from America with new ideas of jazz and big money, and they are both drawn to the beauty and talents of young diva Gordan.&quot;\n\nThe English subtitles are just put through google translate, and might be hard to use at this stage.
