First Edition mp3 320k..........\nMammoth Mammoth (often stylized as MAMMOTH MAMMOTH) is an Australian hard rock/stoner rock band, formed in 2007 in Melbourne,consisting of vocalist Mikey Tucker, guitarist Ben Couzens (Cuz), bassist Pete Bell, and drummer Frank Trobbiani (Bones).\n\nThey independently released their self-titled debut EP in June 2008 through their label, Golden Triangle, followed by the full-length album Volume II: Mammoth in August 2009.\n\nIn November 2012, their third album Volume III: HellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Likely was released, and after good sales in Europe they were approached and signed by the Austrian label Napalm Records.\n\nMammoth MammothÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound has been likened to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Motorhead doing mushrooms with Black Sabbath at a Butt Hole Surfers concert.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe band is well known for its raucous live shows, with Heavy Magazine Australia noting that Ã¢â‚¬Å“their live reputation precedes themÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that lead singer Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mikey Tucker knows no boundaries and goes in hard every time; throwing himself off the stage and throughout the crowd.\n\nMammoth Mammoth was banned from performing at two music venues in Melbourne. At the Tote, Tucker head-butted a glass window to get the attention of punters smoking outside, falling through it. He then continued the show covered in blood.\n\nDescription: \tnew\n\nStyle: \tHeavy Metal\nProduct No.: \t1987015914\n\n\n\nDetails / Tracklist:\n \t\n01. &quot;Life's A Bitch&quot;\n02. &quot;Lookin' Down The Barrel&quot;\n03. &quot;Electric Sunshine&quot;\n04. &quot;Fuel Injected&quot;\n05. &quot;Black Dog&quot;\n06. &quot;Promised Land&quot;\n07. &quot;Reign Supreme&quot;\n08. &quot;Sick (Of Being Sick)&quot;\n09. &quot;Hammered Again&quot;\n10. &quot;High As A Kite&quot;\n11. &quot;Alcohol&quot;\nNumber of discs: \t1\n\n\nBand members\n\n    Mikey Tucker (vocals)\n    Ben Couzens AKA Cuz (guitars)\n    Pete Bell (bass)\n    Frank Trobbiani AKA Bones (drums)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ce853ed79c364068a539a572a0142618a0c9d6","amp;dn":"Mammoth+Mammoth-Vol.IV+Hammered+Again+Ltd.+First+Edition+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ce853ed79c364068a539a572a0142618a0c9d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,206,133,62,215,156,54,64,104,165,57,165,114,160,20,38,24,160,201,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
