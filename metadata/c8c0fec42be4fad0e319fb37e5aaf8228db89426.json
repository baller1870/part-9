There are literally hundreds of plants readily available underfoot waiting to be harvested and used either as food or as a potential therapeutic. This book is both a field guide to nature's bounty and a source of intriguing information about the plants that surround us.\n\n\n\nBy Steve Brill, Evelyn Dean\nPublished by HarperCollins in 2010\nTags: nonfiction, gardening, foraging\nEPUB, Retail, 357 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c0fec42be4fad0e319fb37e5aaf8228db89426","amp;dn":"Identifying%2CHarvesting+Edible+and+Medicinal+Plants%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c0fec42be4fad0e319fb37e5aaf8228db89426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,192,254,196,43,228,250,208,227,25,251,55,229,170,248,34,141,184,148,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
