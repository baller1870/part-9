A keyboard player, Sascha Onnen, was then brought on board for 2000's Temple of Two Suns, and Mob Rules would continue to crank out albums like 2002's Hollowed Be Thy Name and 2004's Among the Gods (both on SPV), while performing their Iron Maiden-derived and largely thrash-free brand of kinetic metal on tours in support of Savatage, Company of Snakes, and others, across mainland Europe. Despite the reliable quality of these releases, however, Mob Rules never reached the higher echelons of the Euro-metal pyramid, and remain largely anonymous in America. And, by the release of 2006's Ethnolution A.D. album (featuring a 25-minute, multi-sectioned title track!), the band had lost both of its founding members, replacing them with guitarist Sven LÃƒÂ¼dke and bassist Markus Brinkmann, but by all accounts planning to carry on henceforth with business as usual. ~\nimage\n\nLine-up:\n\nKlaus Dirks - Vocals\nMatthias Mineur - Guitars\nSven LÃƒÂ¼dke - Guitars\nJan Christian Halfbrodt - Keyboards\nMarkus Brinkmann - Bass\nNikolas Fritz - Drums\n\n\nMob Rules - Timekeeper: 20th Anniversary Boxx (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD1 - THE BEST OF:\n\n01.
