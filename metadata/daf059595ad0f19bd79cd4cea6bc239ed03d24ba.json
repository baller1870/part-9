Police and Army used it and tried to break-up popular groups in the Province of Quebec. More then 400 peoples were arrested for what's look like there social activities. No accusation was ever put against them. This is their story.\n\n\nLes ordres has been rated by critics as one of the best Canadian films ever made. It subtly blends fiction and documentary realism in a chilling portrait of what can happen to a liberal democracy when the state imposes its power.\n\n=============\nSUBS\n===\n\nEnglish subs:\nin the torrent.\n\n\nSpanish subs:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/download/sub/3120955&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/pt/download/sub/3120955&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=============","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf059595ad0f19bd79cd4cea6bc239ed03d24ba","amp;dn":"Les+Ordres+%28Michel+Brault%2C+1974%29+aka+Orderers+%5BDVDrip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf059595ad0f19bd79cd4cea6bc239ed03d24ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,240,89,89,90,208,241,155,215,156,212,206,166,188,35,158,208,61,36,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
