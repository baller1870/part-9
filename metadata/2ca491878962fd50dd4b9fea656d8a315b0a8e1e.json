His approach is a welcome departure from many programming texts, which quickly get bogged down in complex and sometimes meaningless examples. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find here, patiently explained and clearly illustrated, everything you need to learn programming quickly, and to have fun doing it!\n\nYes, programming can be a complex task, and C++ is a language often used by professionals. In fact, many of the coolest games, graphics, and Internet applications are created with C++, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even been used on the Mars rovers. But the language, like the monster pictured on the cover, need not be all that fearsome. Broken down to its essentials, and enhanced by simple examples, practical exercises, and the whys and tricks behind each language feature, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be amazed at the rapid progress you can make.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ca491878962fd50dd4b9fea656d8a315b0a8e1e","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+Without+Fear+-+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+That+Makes+You+Feel+Smart.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ca491878962fd50dd4b9fea656d8a315b0a8e1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,164,145,135,137,98,253,80,221,75,159,234,101,109,138,49,91,10,142,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
