Friday the 13th part 3 in 3D (1982 -1 hour 36 minutes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083972/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083972/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2.

Amityville 3D (1983 -1 hour 29 minutes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085159/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085159/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese movies ARE in Anaglyph 3D! You WILL need the red/blue glasses for watching them!\n\nI listed these as &quot;other quality&quot; as these were originally ripped from the Japanese VHD video disc system from 1990. I didn&amp;#039;t see a listing that specific so I just listed it as more &quot;general&quot;.\n\nThey are encoded with XviD with 2 passes. English. NO Subtitles as there were none. NTSC. All three movies have MP3 Stereo sound.\n\nNOTE 1: These were made from a video system with resolution equal to laser disc at the time. These movies are NOT DVD quality resolution! Laser disc/ Japanese VHD resolution falls in between VHS tapes and DVD.\n\nNOTE 2: These ARE Anaglyph 3D movies. If watching Anaglyph movies and wearing red/blue glasses aren&amp;#039;t your &quot;thing&quot;, then PLEASE don&amp;#039;t download and then turn around and complain. You are only making yourself look like a fool! You have been warned!\n\nThese movies were made in the early 1980&amp;#039;s as &quot;gimmick&quot; films as there was a &quot;3D film revival&quot; taking place at the time. These movies weren&amp;#039;t meant to be intellectual, just fun to watch. So just have fun and enjoy them!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e57189e671dab37d6056198ecb042f841cedd1","amp;dn":"Anaglyph+3D+movies%21+Friday+the+13th%21+JAWS%21+Amityville%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e57189e671dab37d6056198ecb042f841cedd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,229,113,137,230,113,218,179,125,96,86,25,142,203,4,47,132,28,237,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
