For Hynes, a cult favorite who had also worked on the side as a songwriter for some popular artists (including Florence and the Machine, Theophilus London, and Solange Knowles) and as a fashion consultant for Jay-Z's Roccawear, Blood Orange seemed like his most streamlined project, with R&amp;B grooves and atmospheric chillwave keyboards. The debut album Coastal Grooves was released in the summer of 2011 on Domino Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fb24c136d373cf7aaa8c50a6355e6e8d18319a","amp;dn":"Blood+Orange+-+Cupid+Deluxe+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fb24c136d373cf7aaa8c50a6355e6e8d18319a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,251,36,193,54,211,115,207,122,170,140,80,166,53,94,110,141,24,49,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
