In &quot;elegant, finely honed prose&quot; (The Washington Post Book World), Lebowitz limns the vicissitudes of contemporary urban lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€its fads, trends, crazes, morals, and fashions. By turns ironic, facetious, deadpan, sarcastic, wry, wisecracking, and waggish, she is always wickedly entertaining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ad2ba8f374aa579e58c877293e21e52ae533e7","amp;dn":"The+Fran+Lebowitz+Reader+by+Fran+Lebowitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ad2ba8f374aa579e58c877293e21e52ae533e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,173,43,168,243,116,170,87,158,88,200,119,41,62,33,229,42,229,51,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
