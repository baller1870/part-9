It traces her life from her marriage as a 12 year old to the point she negotiates her surrender and is jailed. It also brings out in vivid detail the life and customs in the ravines of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and rajasthan - an area that seems completely cut off from the rest of India.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nShekhar Kapur's sympathetic portrayal of the life of the late Phoolan Devi is one of the best biographical films made in India, not the least for the superb acting by Seema Biswas in the lead role. Biswas is at once rustic, coarse and vulnerable and it is her ability to leave the city behind that makes her character so believable. She is supported by a splendid cast, where everyone seems to outdo others - a tribute to Sekhar Kapur really. I admired his ability to get the best out of children - children who play the role of abused youngsters.\r\n\r\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan comes up with some memorable musical pieces. Cinematography of Ashok Mehta is a delight as he capture the wild beauty of the ravines but the best part is the editing by Renu Saluja..\r\n\r\nOverall a fine film. A film worth watching.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nWhile watching the movie remember that it was shot in 1994, when technology was not what it was today. The night scenes are therefore grainy and a little less distinct and the video format is the older 16:9 rather than the wider 2.35:1 favoured these days. Still it is a good BD and was quite a pleasure to rip. We have tried to capture detail as much as we could and have selectively reduced the graininess. The Subtitles are unfortunately, hardcoded in the Blu-Ray and we were not able to do much with that.\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-bit HEVC encoding in x265. As a result, we are able to bring you this level of quality in just 5.52GB swith DTS sound.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices. You can only watch this on a computer or a compatible device. On your computer be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0). Earlier versions may not work\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109206/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3621376a9e626bbe38bab686dd7e070c7b72dc7f","amp;dn":"Bandit+Queen+%281994%29+-+BD+Rip+-+1080p+-+HEVC-x265.DTSHD+-+DDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3621376a9e626bbe38bab686dd7e070c7b72dc7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,33,55,106,158,98,107,190,56,186,182,134,221,126,7,12,123,114,220,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
