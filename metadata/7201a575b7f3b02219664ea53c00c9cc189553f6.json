Now imagine four women --a police detective, an assistant DA, a reporter, and a medical examiner --who join forces as they sidestep their bosses to track down criminals. Known as the Women's Murder Club, they are pursuing a murderer whose twisted imagination has stunned an entire city. Their chief suspect is a socially prominent writer, but the men in charge won't touch him. On the trail of the most terrifying and unexpected killer ever, they discover a shocking surprise that turns everything about the case upside down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7201a575b7f3b02219664ea53c00c9cc189553f6","amp;dn":"1st+To+Die+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7201a575b7f3b02219664ea53c00c9cc189553f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,1,165,117,183,243,176,34,25,102,78,165,60,0,201,204,24,149,83,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
