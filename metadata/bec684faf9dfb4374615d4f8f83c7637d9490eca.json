His live shows are stripped-down affairs: half music, half standup comedy, with the humor balancing out the frequently introspective songs. Nathanson has released several independent albums, including Please (1993), Ernst (1997), Not Colored Too Perfect (1998), and Still Waiting for Spring (1999), as well as an EP, When Everything Meant Everything (2002). His major-label debut, Beneath These Fireworks, was produced by Ron Aniello and released by Universal Records in 2003, and was followed in 2007 by Some Mad Hope, his debut for Vanguard Records, featuring the single &quot;Come on Get Higher,&quot; which was featured as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist spot. Nathanson's songs have also been featured on a number of television shows, including Good Morning America, NCIS, Private Practice, American Idol, Vampire Diaries, American Pie, and 90210. He's also made television appearances on shows hosted by David Letterman, Ellen DeGeneres, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, and Craig Ferguson. In 2011, Vanguard issued his seventh studio effort, Modern Love. Nathanson returned in 2013 with the album Last of the Great Pretenders, featuring the single &quot;Mission Bells.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bec684faf9dfb4374615d4f8f83c7637d9490eca","amp;dn":"Matt+Nathanson+-+Discography+%281998-2013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bec684faf9dfb4374615d4f8f83c7637d9490eca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,198,132,250,249,223,180,55,70,21,212,248,248,60,118,55,217,73,14,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
