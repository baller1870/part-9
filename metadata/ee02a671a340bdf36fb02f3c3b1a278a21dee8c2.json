Held in an underground cell, her only contact was with her sadistic captor, and reading his face was her entire existence. Learning his every line, every movement, and every flicker of thought is what kept her alive.\r\n\r\nAfter her experience with isolation and torture, she is left with a fierce desire for justiceâ€”and a heightened ability to interpret the body language of both the living and the dead. Despite colleaguesâ€™ doubts about her mental state, she resumes her role at Homicide. Her new partner, Detective Uriah Ashby, doesnâ€™t trust her sanity, and he has a story of his own heâ€™d rather keep hidden. But a killer is on the loose, murdering young women, so the detectives have no choice: they must work together to catch the madman before he strikes again. And no one knows madmen like Jude Fontaine. \r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee02a671a340bdf36fb02f3c3b1a278a21dee8c2","amp;dn":"Anne+Frasier+-+The+Body+Reader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee02a671a340bdf36fb02f3c3b1a278a21dee8c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,2,166,113,163,64,189,243,111,176,47,60,59,26,39,138,33,222,232,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
