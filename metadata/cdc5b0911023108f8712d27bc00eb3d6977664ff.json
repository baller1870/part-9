Do you need more than that?! Fine, then: monkeys! And maybe Dr. Strange if you're good! This is the Deadpool series you will marry someday! In Wade We Trust!\n\nThen: flash back to Deadpool's adventures in yesteryear with Iron Man! And, Deadpool is hired by a demon to reclaim damned souls! And just in case you didn't think he could get any stranger, Wade gets in touch with his feminine side!\n\nPlus: Deadpool targets a man with aquatic powers! Then he teams-up with your Superior Neighborhood Spider-Man! And we promise you that he kills one of those two! Gerry Duggan and Brian Posehn's hilarious, nonstop reinvention of the Merc With a Mouth continues here!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc5b0911023108f8712d27bc00eb3d6977664ff","amp;dn":"DEADPOOL+001-014+%282012-present%29+Up-to-date+thru+August+14%2C+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc5b0911023108f8712d27bc00eb3d6977664ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,197,176,145,16,35,16,143,135,18,210,123,192,14,179,214,151,118,100,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
