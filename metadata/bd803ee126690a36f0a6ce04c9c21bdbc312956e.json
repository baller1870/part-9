Its six chapters discuss, first, certain ancient ideas about truth; secondly, the Aristotelian conception of predication; thirdly, various ideas about connectors which were developed by the ancient logicians and grammarians; fourthly, the notion of logical form, insofar as it may be discovered in the ancient texts; fifthly, the question of the 'justification of deduction'; and sixthly, the attitude which has been called logical utilitarianism and which restricts the scope of logic to those forms of inference which are or might be useful for scientific proofs. In principle, the book presupposes no knowledge of logic and no skill in ancient languages: all ancient texts are cited in English translation; and logical symbols and logical jargon are avoided so far as possible. There is no scholarly apparatus of footnotes, and no bibliography. It can be read in an armchair. Anyone interested in ancient philosophy, or in logic and its history, will find it interesting.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nBesides providing fresh discussions of many well-known pieces of ancient logical doctrine, Barnes discovers and follows several untrodden paths of research that sometimes lead him very far form the familiar roads. This he can do, often very convincingly, thanks to his complete control over an impressive wealth of primary sources. The book thus enriches the received canon of ancient logical texts, giving voice to several minor figures. In many of its analyses and interpretations, Barnes's book reveals itself as an outstanding example of lucid philosophical thinking. No doubt, it will long continue to inspire and stimulate anyone wishing to think seriously about ancient logic. Paolo Fait, RHIZAI\n\nThe logic and philosophy is lightened and enlightened, with the author's splendid lightness of touch, of word and of style, which takes us through quips, tales and insights... At heart, Truth,etc. is a guided tour through significant controversies that kept the hearts beating of antiquity's logicians... Readers are likely to delight in the scholarship and learning on display. Peter Cave, Philosophy\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nJonathan Barnes was educated at the City of London School and at Balliol College.
