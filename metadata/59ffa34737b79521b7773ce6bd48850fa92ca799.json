In each episode, Kerfumbly demands a different kind of story from Marion, who gathers materials from the dungeon, puts them into a machine, and out pops a book. Marion then reads the book to the audience while illustrations of the story are shown on the screen. This show was filmed in Omaha, Nebraska for Nebraska Public Television, and was shown widely in the late 1970's and early 1980's.\nEpisode Name: Humbug Witch\nNetwork: PBS\n\t\npresents:\n\nOnce Upon a Time\nS01E07\n\nGeneral Information\n\nLOL Release :  12/11/2011\nLink : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/OnceUponATime&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/OnceUponATime&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEncode Information\n\nVideo :  XviD\nAudio :  MP3 2ch 48khz\nAspect Ratio :  16:9\nResolution :  624x352\nFrame Rate :  23.976024 fps\nRAR Size :  350MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ffa34737b79521b7773ce6bd48850fa92ca799","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+S01E07+HDTV.XviD-LOL%5Bettv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ffa34737b79521b7773ce6bd48850fa92ca799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,255,163,71,55,183,149,33,183,119,60,230,189,72,133,15,169,44,167,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
