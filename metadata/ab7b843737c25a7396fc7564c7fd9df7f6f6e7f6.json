The booming times of market optimismÃ¢â‚¬â€when the culture boiled with money and corporations seemed more vital and influential than governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€ are poised to crash. Eric Packer, a billionaire asset manager at age twenty-eight, emerges from his penthouse triplex and settles into his lavishly customized white stretch limousine. \n\nToday he is a man with two missions: to pursue a cataclysmic bet against the yen and to get a haircut across town. Stalled in traffic by a presidential motorcade, a music idolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral and a violent political demonstration, Eric receives a string of visitorsÃ¢â‚¬â€experts on security, technology, currency, finance and a few sexual partnersÃ¢â‚¬â€as the limo sputters toward an increasingly uncertain future.\n\nCosmopolis, Don DeLilloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thirteenth novel, is both intimate and global, a vivid and moving account of the spectacular downfall of one man, and of an era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7b843737c25a7396fc7564c7fd9df7f6f6e7f6","amp;dn":"Cosmopolis%3A+A+Novel+-+Don+Delillo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7b843737c25a7396fc7564c7fd9df7f6f6e7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,123,132,55,55,194,90,115,150,252,117,100,199,253,157,247,246,246,231,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
