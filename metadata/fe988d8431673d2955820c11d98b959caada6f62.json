Simba (voiced first by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then by Matthew Broderick) begins life as an honored prince, son of the powerful King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and Timon the meerkat (voiced by Nathan Lane) and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne. Borrowing elements from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer. Embraced by children and adults alike, the film also spawned hit songs (&quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;, &quot;Circle of Life&quot; and a hit Broadway musical. In late 2002, The Lion King was re-released in the large-screen IMAX format\n\nIMDB Rating: Ratings: 8.3/10\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/\n\nIMDB Trailer: http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi297376793/\n\nRun Time: 89 min\n\n Genre: Animation | Adventure | Comedy\n\n Release Date: 24 June 1994 (USA)\n\nTricked into thinking he killed his father, a guilt ridden lion cub flees into exile and abandons his identity as the future King. \n\n Directors: Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff\n\n Writers: Irene Mecchi (screenplay), Jonathan Roberts (screenplay), and 27 more credits.\n\n Stars: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones\n\n[img]http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/7746/vlcsnap2011081912h04m53.png[/img]\n[img]http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/2626/vlcsnap2011081912h09m44.png[/img]\n[img]http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/139/vlcsnap2011081912h51m07.png[/img]\n[img]http://img814.imageshack.us/img814/8694/vlcsnap2011081912h10m00.png[/img]\n[img]http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/4105/vlcsnap2011081912h06m39.png[/img]\n[img]http://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4171/vlcsnap2011081912h16m26.png[/img]\n[img]http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/3499/vlcsnap2011081912h17m56.png[/img]\n[img]http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/503/vlcsnap2011081912h51m20.png[/img]\n[img]http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/1689/vlcsnap2011081912h18m24.png[/img]\n\nCredits To Original Source","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe988d8431673d2955820c11d98b959caada6f62","amp;dn":"The+Lion+King+1994+%28Special+Edition%29+720P+HDTV+Eng+Subs+%5B+Team+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe988d8431673d2955820c11d98b959caada6f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,152,141,132,49,103,61,41,85,130,12,17,217,139,149,156,170,218,111,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
