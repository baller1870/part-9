But one victim, quick-drawing gambler Luke Cromwell, escapes. Meanwhille, Marshal Lightnin' Tyrone is also after the gang; recovering from one raid, he meets femme fatale Opal Lacy, who may not be healthy for him to know. When Luke, now calling himself the Silver Kid, joins forces with Marshal Tyrone, the gang had better watch out ...unless something drives a wedge between the new allies. \n\nUser Review\n\nDon Siegel directed a delightful, fast paced, fun western, with tongue firmly in cheek. Audie Murphy isn't half bad as the poker-loving &quot;Silver Kid&quot;, dressed in black leather. Featured are several unique characters like &quot;Johnny Sombrero&quot;, who wears extravagant clothes, combs his hair up,and of course puts on a large sombrero. The script makes fun of all the western clichÃƒÂ©s, camping it up while moving the story briskly. Faith Domergue is alluringly devious and mean as the bad girl and love interest. Lee Marvin has a small but remarkable role, and sports a big mustache.\n\nI like the way the straight hero is played for a fool until the end, and his poker playing sidekick gets all the action and glory. Siegel, as usual, excels with the action scenes, but this is not a thriller per say, more a fast paced action romp very similar in style to &quot;The Big Steal&quot;, which Siegel directed before this film. I really enjoyed it.
