In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg shook America        \n           to its foundations when he smuggled a top-secret Pentagon      \n           study to the New York Times that showed how five               \n           Presidents consistently lied to the American people about      \n           the Vietnam War that was killing millions and tearing          \n           America apart. President Nixon's National Security             \n           Advisor Henry Kissinger called Ellsberg &quot;the most              \n           dangerous man in America,&quot; who &quot;had to be stopped at all       \n           costs.&quot; But Ellsberg wasn't stopped. Facing 115 years in       \n           prison on espionage and conspiracy charges, he fought          \n           back. Ensuing events surrounding the so-called Pentagon        \n           Papers led directly to Watergate and the downfall of           \n           President Nixon, and hastened the end of the Vietnam War.      \n           Ellsberg's relentless telling of truth to power, which         \n           exposed the secret deeds of an &quot;Imperial Presidency,&quot;          \n           inspired Americans of all walks of life to forever             \n           question the previously-unchallenged pronouncements of         \n           its leaders. &quot;The Most Dangerous Man in America&quot; tells         \n           the inside story, for the first time on film, of this          \n           pivotal event that changed history and transformed our         \n           nation's political discourse. It is told largely by the        \n           players of that dramatic episode-Ellsberg, his                 \n           colleagues, family and critics; Pentagon Papers authors        \n           and government officials; Vietnam veterans and anti-war        \n           activists; Watergate principals, attorneys and the             \n           journalists who both covered the story and were an             \n           integral part of it; and finally-through White House           \n           audiotapes-President Nixon and his inner circle of             \n           advisors.                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           John Dean.................. : ....................Himself      \n           Daniel Ellsberg............ : ....................Himself      \n           Patricia Ellsberg.......... : ....................Herself      \n           Max Frankel................ : ....................Himself      \n           Bud Krogh.................. : Himself (as Egil 'Bud' Krog      \n           Tony Russo................. : ....................Himself      \n           Hedrick Smith.............. : ....................Himself      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n             Previous release was a fake one added to spam predb's.         \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
