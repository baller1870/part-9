They formed in 2006 as Achilles Rising but later changed their name to At the Hands of Machines. In mid 2008 they changed their name once again to The Contortionist. Shortly after the name change original vocalist Jake Morris left the band and was replaced by former Ishia vocalist Dave Hoffman. Here is their about me from their myspace page: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run-of-the-mill hardcore/metal bands are a dime a dozen these days. But when a band can take a genre so over saturated and give it a fresh take- itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth taking a closer look. THE CONTORTIONIST is a five piece metal/grind band hailing from north Indianapolis.\n\nStarting out in the summer of 2007, they recorded their first EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sporadic MovementsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that fall. They returned to Trigger Studios in June of 2008 and completed their second work Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShapeshifterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Long time vocalist/frontman Jake Morris quit the band shortly after the completion of the album due to personal issues, and Dave Hoffman (Into The Silence, Ishia) has stepped in to fill in with his own brand of intense stage presence. From dive bombs, bass bombs, gutturals to synths and singing - THE CONTORTIONIST blends sheer brutality with pure melody. This showcase of passion, dedication, and preparation has landed them a full show schedule. And continuing to become a highly demanded act in the area, they are constantly searching for more out-of-state opportunitiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and they like to PARTY.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n1. Infection\n2. Realms  \n3.
