It's an atmospheric, emotional record that reflects their home environment of Gerlan, North Wales. As Lisa Jen explains, 'tincian can mean a lot of things, to move with a tinkling sound, to ring and make a clear sound. Depending on what area of Wales you are from, the meaning varies. It comes to life in dialogue when you use sentences like &quot;I gave him such a talking to, he didn't know what had hit him...he was 'tincian'.&quot; It's almost like a cartoon image of someone's head being hit by a hammer'.\n\nTincian can also mean 'to resonate... it's like the bell of your memories, the sound in your mind that awakens to things forgotten. It would have also been used in sentences like &quot;ma na rhyw *dincian ymhlith y bobol&quot;. (&quot;There is a murmur amongst the people&quot;). That kind of whisper, that fear or excitement of a (bad) report amongst the people like a wave of noise'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c50587c96a30d533b0abf6fbbc92bf1d94f41d8","amp;dn":"9Bach+-+Tincian+%5B2014%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c50587c96a30d533b0abf6fbbc92bf1d94f41d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,80,88,124,150,163,13,83,59,10,191,111,187,201,43,241,217,79,65,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
