Developed immediately after World War II (1939-1945), the RPG-series have proved to be simple, flexible, and powerful devices, which have had an impact far beyond original expectations. Track its development and deployment firsthand, from the Vietnam hills to the streets of modern Baghdad.\n\nGordon Rottman provides a detailed analysis of perhaps one of the most important weapons to be developed in the 20th century. He has been at the receiving end of the RPG-2 and RPG-7 as well as firing them himself, providing personal testament to the effectiveness with which they accomplished their missions. This in-depth coverage is well-accompanied by Ramiro Bujeiro's battlescene artwork and Tony Bryan's cutaway illustrations.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Rocket-Propelled-Grenade-Weapon/dp/1849081530/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332781549&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Rocket-Propelled-Grenade-Weapon/dp/1849081530/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332781549&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d7eeb4075ca9b4f2b1bc4c1f5f9e29d5a05350","amp;dn":"The+Rocket+Propelled+Grenade+%28+Osprey+Weapon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d7eeb4075ca9b4f2b1bc4c1f5f9e29d5a05350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,215,238,180,7,92,169,180,242,177,188,76,31,95,158,41,213,160,83,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
