Based on extensive archival research in Switzerland, Britain, and the United States, and in-depth interviews with key decision-makers - including Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve; Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England; and former senior Bank for International Settlements managers and officials - Tower of Basel tells the inside story of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS): the central bankers' own bank.\n\nAfter 1945 the BIS - still behind the scenes - for decades provided the necessary technical and administrative support for the trans-European currency project, from the first attempts to harmonize exchange rates in the late 1940s to the launch of the Euro in 2002. It now stands at the center of efforts to build a new global financial and regulatory architecture, once again proving that it has the power to shape the financial rules of our world. Yet despite its pivotal role in the financial and political history of the last century and during the economic current crisis, the BIS has remained largely unknown - until now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0312f2f7aea19ba9e8571dce3c8d791d6f6ba4ed","amp;dn":"Tower+of+Basel+The+Shadowy+History+of+the+Secret+Bank+that+Runs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0312f2f7aea19ba9e8571dce3c8d791d6f6ba4ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,18,242,247,174,161,155,169,232,87,29,206,60,141,121,29,111,107,164,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
