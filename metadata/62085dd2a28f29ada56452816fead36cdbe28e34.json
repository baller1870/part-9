Their live shows try to emulate and recreate the sound and soundscape of Pink Floyd's live shows. Damian Darlington formed the band after playing with The Australian Pink Floyd Show for 17 years.\r\nDarlington began following Pink Floyd's work after hearing The Wall at the age of 13 and he saw the band live for the first time in 1987 during the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. &quot;Since then, he has seen the band in different incarnations, after its split, and including its 2005 reunion.&quot;\r\n\r\nRegarding his growing up listening to the band, Darlington stated: &quot;I definitely listened to Pink Floyd. I remember Another Brick In The Wall being No. 1 in the UK. It was December 1979. Probably my first memory of Pink Floyd. Then I actually heard The Wall album in its entirety and that's what particularly drew me to Pink Floyd about the age of 12 or 13.\r\n\r\nRecorded in front of a sold-out audience at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado on Friday, August 2, 2013, &quot;Brit Floyd: Live At Red Rocks&quot; captures the magic and majesty of Pink Floyd's legendary music set against the awe-inspiring natural rocks and Colorado landscape. \r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nDisk 1\r\n\r\n01.
