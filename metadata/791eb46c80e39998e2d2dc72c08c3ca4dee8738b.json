This metaphor is particularly adept in a world where men such as Tom Leykis, Dr. Drew, Howard Stern, and a legion of menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magazines and porno providers become wealthy by selling glasses of toilet water to thirsty men across our nation, many of whom claim to be sons of God. Meanwhile, the church alone has access to the living water from GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect Word, but largely fails to teach men masculinity in any area, particularly regarding their sexuality.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nBorn in North Dakota, Mark Driscoll grew up in south Seattle, the son of a union drywaller. After graduating from high school, he attended Washington State University on scholarship. He became a Christian during his freshman year, and finished college with a degree in speech communication from the Edward R. Murrow School of Communication. He later completed a master's degree in exegetical theology from Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon.\nWith a skillful mix of bold presentation, accessible teaching, and compassion for those who are hurting the most--in particular, women who are victims of sexual and physical abuse and assault--Pastor Mark has taken biblical Christianity into cultural corners rarely explored by evangelicals.\nHe is the cofounder of the Acts 29 Network, which has planted over 400 churches in the U.S. and over a dozen other nations. Pastor Mark Driscoll is the founding pastor of Mars Hill Church, based in Seattle, Washington, and one of the most popular preachers in the world today.\nIn 2010, Preaching magazine named him one of the 25 most influential pastors of the past 25 years. Pastor Mark's online sermons are downloaded millions of times each year, he is the author of over 15 books, and he has also written for CNN, The Washington Post, The Seattle Times, and many other outlets.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:791eb46c80e39998e2d2dc72c08c3ca4dee8738b","amp;dn":"Porn-Again+Christian+-+Mark+Driscoll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"791eb46c80e39998e2d2dc72c08c3ca4dee8738b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,30,180,108,128,227,153,152,226,210,220,114,192,140,60,164,222,232,115,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
