Neither Gizmo Dee nor his brother Milk are proficient rappers with above average lyrical capabilities, but the way they play off each other is occasionally enough to cause some excitement. &quot;Top Billin'&quot; stands easily as the best track here, thanks in no small part to Daddy O's sparse yet infectious work -- the beat would later reappear in Mary J. Blige's &quot;Real Love.&quot; Other entertaining moments include &quot;Hickeys Around My Neck&quot; and &quot;Make It Funky.&quot; ~ Andy Kellman\n\nLive Recording\n\nRecording information: First Priority Lab, Staten Island, NY; I.N.S.
