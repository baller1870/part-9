The final concert was recorded in Dortmund, Germany on December 21, 1986. Available in very limited quantities. Features the last performance of Jaco Pastorius. Japanese original release. This live album, recorded in Dortmund, Germany, Dec 12, 1986, is Jaco's memorable last performance in his life. Jaco at the time was vibrant, good in health, and played well. The recording plan as The Holy Ghost, power trio with a gutarist and a drummer, was in progress with MCA Records at the same time. Jaco stated &quot;Although I have played in many form of bands like Wheather Report, Word of Mough Big band, sextet, I am now having fun with trio. I expect I can create new sound with lots more space.\n\nEven though the deal with MCA did not come to fruition, this precious recording is filled with the trio sound designed in Jaco's mind. The energetic performance of this show let you convince that it comes from the collaboration with the guitarist Bireli Lagrene and the drummer Peter Rubiku with their musical trust and respect.\n\nThe set list has Jaco's signature number &quot;Continuum&quot; as well as Weather Report's smash hit &quot;Birdland&quot;. Bireli's &quot;Berga&quot; gives listners fresh sound along with interesting arrangement of familiar &quot;Purple Haze Medley&quot;. The standard number &quot;The Days Of Wine And Roses&quot; represents Jaco's sense of melody and musician ship.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Berga\n02 - The Days Of Wine And Roses\n03 - The Medley,The High And The Mighty, Purple Haze, Changes\n04 - Birdland\n05 - Continuum\n06 - I Shot The Sheriff\n07 - Bireli's Improvisation\n08 - Fannie Mae\n\n*2014 King Records Japan / Vision Quest Music | KICJ-672\n\n\nPersonnel:\nJaco Pastorius - electric bass, vocal\nBireli Lagrene - electric guitar\nPeter Lubke - drums\n\n\n\nEnjoy and sharing, Thanks!\n\n\n\nJaco Pastorius Big Band - Twins I (1982) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10262762/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_I_%281982%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10262762/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_I_%281982%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJaco Pastorius Big Band - Twins II (1982) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10303431/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_II_%281982%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10303431/Jaco_Pastorius_Big_Band_-_Twins_II_%281982%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45cc99f512021d479c2cc91e6390fd901cbd6817","amp;dn":"Jaco+Pastorius+-+Last+Live+1986+%282014%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45cc99f512021d479c2cc91e6390fd901cbd6817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,204,153,245,18,2,29,71,156,44,201,30,99,144,253,144,28,189,104,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
