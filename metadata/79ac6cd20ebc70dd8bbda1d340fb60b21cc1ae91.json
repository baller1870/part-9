Montgomery said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sittinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ right over there in your band,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pointing to Pass. This new collection from Mosaic will show you why. &quot;\n\nJOE PASS. YOU CAN FOCUS ON HIS TECHNICAL MASTERY, AND MISS HALF THE STORY ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ HIS MUSICALITY.\n\nThe flowing lines and harmonic complexities of bebop are daunting on any instrument, but they particularly challenge guitar players. Not so Joe Pass, who went the beboppers one better; by finger picking, he figured out how to fill and add bass notes as well as solo. In other words, he could do it all self-contained. \n\nBut PassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ skill wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just in his ability to move dexterously around the fingerboard. The truly extraordinary aspect of his playing was how musical it all sounded. PassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ improvised solos were often crafted well enough to have been melodies in and of themselves. \n\nBad habits, and the odd gigs he worked to fuel them, kept him in obscurity until his thirties. Only then -- with his appearances on Pacific Jazz records with the cream of the L.A. crop -- were PassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ gifts revealed. Today, at least one of those LPs (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor DjangoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is considered a must-have in any jazz library. The new Mosaic collection of his Pacific quartet sessions lays out the full range of what this gentle, self-effacing musician could do. \n\nRigorous Practicing \n\nBorn in 1929, Pass grew up the oldest of five children, son to a Johnstown, Pennsylvania steel worker. Music was to be his escape from manual labor, decided his dad, who set up a rigorous six-hour-a-day practice regimen for the boy. \n\nPerhaps because guitar stayed in the background for so much of jazzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ relegated to the quietest corners of the rhythm section until amplification came along ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ few leaders on the instrument existed for Pass to idolize. His early heroes were horn players (Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young) and pianists (Art Tatum, Al Haig). \n\nA gig with Ray McKinley got him to New York in 1949 where he became a jam session regular and a drug addict with an erratic career path. The fifties were lost years, playing strip joints in New Orleans or lounges in Las Vegas between hospital stays for his addiction. \n\nFinger picking was one result of Pass spending so many years knocking around. Using all his fingers instead of a pick ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ filling chords and providing his own bottom support -- allowed him to make up for the inadequacies of his band mates. His style, born out of necessity, later would be recognized as proof of his strong sense of harmony and sensitivity regarding accompaniment. \n\nPass Finds a Home \n\nIt wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until Pass decided to go straight and entered Synanon where Pacific Jazz discovered him in 1962 that he finally began getting the exposure and recognition he deserved. He guested with Pacific Jazz regulars Richard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrooveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Holmes, Les McCann, Gerald Wilson and Bud Shank before getting a date of his own. \n\nThis set includes his &quot;Catch Me!&quot; LP with Clare Fischer, Ralph Pena and Larry Bunker or Albert Stinson and Colin Bailey (8 unissued tunes from those sessions are added), Les McCann's &quot;On Time&quot; and &quot;Soul Hits&quot; LPs with 2 unissued tracks from each, &quot;12-String Guitar Movie Themes&quot; and &quot;For Django&quot; (with 3 unissued tracks) by his quartet with fellow guitarist John Pisano, his live &quot;Joy Spring &quot; album with 4 more tracks and newly discovered Pass sessions (one backed by the McCann trio, another with his drummerless 1964 working group with Pisano and Frank Strazzeri and a third with the &quot;For Django&quot; band playing Hank Williams tunes!). \n\nAlways clean, articulate, and effective, Pass also had unstoppable swing and an ability to create memorable, beautifully-constructed solos. \n\nThe 5-CD set includes a complete discography, a full essay by Kirk Silsbee and many rare photographs from the actual sessions and the era. [/quote]\n\n[quote=Reviewer Mosaic Website] It was the 'Woody Woodbury Show'. Wes finished playing, put his guitar down, walked to Woody's desk, and before sitting down, bent over to whisper something in Woody's ear. After Wes sat, Woody told the audience, (paraphrase): &quot;This humble man has just told me that he's embarrassed to be the featured soloist when such a great guitarist as Joe Pass is in the band.&quot; [/quote]\n\n[quote=AMG] [img=http://allmusic.com/i/pages/site/stars/st_r5.gif]\nGuitarist Joe Pass was known for his forthright, straight-ahead style, gorgeous tone, and melodic concepts. This magnificent five-CD set collects his entire output in 1963 and 1964 as a leader, with additional sessions in which Pass plays in a trio led by Les McCann. Most of the tracks feature a quartet (the five exceptions adding the saxophone or flute of Bill Perkins), with the guitarist virtually always a key voice. Pass recorded three records for Pacific after 1964 with limited jazz content, and they are not included in this collection for that reason. While many of the dozens of selections included here do not measure up to Pass' exemplary work recorded later on Pablo Records (a prime example being his classic Virtuoso LP), there are fine tracks to be found in the instant set that no admirer of either Pass or of the jazz guitar will want to be without. This is particularly true of the Django LP sessions with guitarist John Pisano, originally issued on Pacific, as well as the final CD in the instant collection that was initially issued on the Blue Note label, and on which the individual tracks are noticeably lengthier and more substantial. Elsewhere, some of the repertoire is checkered, mixing movie themes, country &amp; western, soul, and jazz standards. But who can really complain about hearing the great guitarist playing Hank Williams' &quot;Hey, Good Lookin'&quot; or &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot;? As with all the Mosaic boxed sets, this one comes in a strictly limited edition with a comprehensive, oversized booklet containing a detailed discography and liner notes, extreme attention to detail, and excellent sound quality.
