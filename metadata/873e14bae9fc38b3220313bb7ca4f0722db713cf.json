Fans who order the album will receive an instant download of the first single, &quot;Thank You&quot;.\r\n\r\nLajon Witherspoon recently told The Aquarian Weekly about the making of &quot;Kill The Flaw&quot;: &quot;The whole thing, to me, was such an experience and fun because we were able to take a break and unplug and to get that creative process within us when we went into the studio to do this album.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe continued: &quot;We went in with this live effect. There wasnâ€™t anything really written for this album, so what we did was we set up on the live stage and everything was mic'd, from guitars to drums, so we were able to record while we were rehearsing pieces of songs. Then we would go in from 12 noon until 12 midnight and during the day, we would just get up there as the band SEVENDUST like when we started, which we loved to do, and just jam. Things came out and thatâ€™s the way this album, 'Kill The Flaw', came together, man. It was just like the beginning of our career when we sat down and jammed together like a band and it's what I think made this album flow so easily and come out with so many cool songs.&quot;\r\n\r\nAll songs written and composed by Sevendust. \r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\r\n1. \t&quot;Thank You&quot;   \t4:27\r\n2. \t&quot;Death Dance&quot;   \t3:39\r\n3. \t&quot;Forget&quot;   \t4:15\r\n4. \t&quot;Letters&quot;   \t3:50\r\n5. \t&quot;Cease and Desist&quot;   \t4:51\r\n6. \t&quot;Not Today&quot;   \t4:42\r\n7. \t&quot;Chop&quot;   \t4:10\r\n8. \t&quot;Kill the Flaw&quot;   \t3:52\r\n9. \t&quot;Silly Beast&quot;   \t4:43\r\n10. \t&quot;Peace and Destruction&quot;   \t4:17\r\n11. \t&quot;Torched&quot;   \t3:20\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lajon Witherspoon - lead vocals\r\n    Clint Lowery - lead guitar, backing vocals\r\n    John Connolly - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Vinnie Hornsby - bass guitar\r\n    Morgan Rose - drums, backing vocals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n    Mike Ferretti - recording engineer, mixing engineer\r\n    Kurt Wubbenhorst - keyboards and sound design\r\n    Andy VanDette - mastering\r\n    Frank Maddocks - artwork, layout design, photography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873e14bae9fc38b3220313bb7ca4f0722db713cf","amp;dn":"Sevendust+-+Kill+The+Flaw+%282015%29192ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873e14bae9fc38b3220313bb7ca4f0722db713cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,62,20,186,233,252,56,179,34,3,19,187,124,164,240,114,45,183,19,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
