From other side every day a couple of new security bugs found in plugins, themes and WordPress itself. Are we safe? Can all plugin authors be notified timely about bugs? Are all of them responsible for security problems they generated? or can we update our plugins everyday? Hide My WP created to help us. It not only boosts our security but it also allows us to have more beautiful URLs and permalinks!\n\nIntroducing Intrusion Detection System: \nThis is one of the most important features so far! Remember, what happened few months ago for Revolution Slider and Showbiz. There was a serious vulnerability which affects lots of premium themes and websites. Now IDS is here to protect your site against similar issues in future! Technically, it monitors all of requests of the site and assign a number (i.e. Impact Factor) to each request base on tens security checks. Impact factor indicates how much dangerous is that request. Should it be blocked? Should site admin be notified about it or we should just log it for future validity check. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s useful against almost any type of attacks, any vulnerable plugin or theme! It may takes some time to trade off configuration in order to minimize false positives\n\nProduct page: http://codecanyon.net/item/hide-my-wp-no-one-can-know-you-use-wordpress/4177158\n\nThis plugin has been fully nulled, to install simply upload it to your host like you would any other wordpress plugin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d4b4ea3642f6ac38923020998a42a26f311c1ba","amp;dn":"Hide+My+WP+v4.01+-+No+one+can+know+you+use+WordPress%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d4b4ea3642f6ac38923020998a42a26f311c1ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,75,78,163,100,47,106,195,137,35,2,9,152,164,42,38,243,17,193,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
