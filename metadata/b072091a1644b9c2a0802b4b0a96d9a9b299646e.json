With his heart on his sleeve, lead vocalist/principal songwriter Mac Powell gives voice to the emotions all believers feel as they attempt to reconcile everyday struggles with the hope born of salvation. Songs like &quot;Run to You,&quot; &quot;Born Again,&quot; &quot;This Is Who I Am,&quot; and &quot;Call My Name,&quot; are like musical stepping stones on the bandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s personal journey.\n\nThird Day's success has also earned them respect and admiration from other artists.
