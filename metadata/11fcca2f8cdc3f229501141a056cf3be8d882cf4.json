It has some superficial similarities with Robert A. Heinlein's &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (such as the military use of exoskeletons and insect-like alien enemies) but concentrates more on the psychological effects of violence on human beings rather than on the political aspects of the military, which was the focus of Heinlein's novel.\nIt was first published in December 1984.\n&quot;Armor 2&quot; is apparently on the works.\n\nJohn Steakley is also the author of &quot;Vampire$&quot;, the novel in which the film &quot;Vampires&quot;, by John Carpenter, was based.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11fcca2f8cdc3f229501141a056cf3be8d882cf4","amp;dn":"Armor+by+John+Steakley+%28unabridged%29-FIXED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11fcca2f8cdc3f229501141a056cf3be8d882cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,252,202,47,140,220,63,34,149,1,20,26,5,108,243,190,141,136,44,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
