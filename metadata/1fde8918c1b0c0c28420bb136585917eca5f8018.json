The fact that their range encompassed jazz as well as rhythm &amp; blues, coupled with some elements of their appearance and presentation -- co-founder/keyboardist Manfred Mann's bearded, bespectacled presence -- also made the Manfreds more of a thinking person's band than a cute, cuddly, outfit like the Beatles, or sexual provocateurs in the manner of the Rolling Stones. Yet, their approach to R&amp;B was as valid as that of the Stones, equally compelling and often more sophisticated. They charted an impressive number of singles from 1964 through 1969, and developed a large, loyal international fandom that lingers to this day.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/manfred-mann-p417071/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/manfred-mann-p417071/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThis is one of nearly a dozen anthologies of Manfred Mann's music that cover their EMI period, and the 25 songs here make it the biggest of them. Additionally, there is an 11-minute interview with the band here, dating from December of 1964, that has never before appeared on record in the United States. The hits are all here, sometimes in more than one version, along with a cross-section of album tracks and B-sides, and it all sounds very good, though EMI's recent 24-bit remasterings of the band's original British LPs are much more impressive. But this CD misses being &quot;definitive&quot; because it leaves out some key B-sides to their early singles and overlooks the contents of several top-selling British EPs. The truth be told, no single CD, even one 73 minutes long, would be adequate to the task of defining this group's history or sound, even just covering the years 1963-66. As it is, the presence here of numbers like &quot;She&quot; and &quot;The One in the Middle&quot; (both written by Paul Jones) and their version of &quot;My Little Red Book&quot; (not a favorite of the band members, incidentally), makes this an essential part of any collection of the band's work, but one should also own The Singles Plus to get access to numbers like &quot;Groovin'&quot; and &quot;Brother Jack,&quot; and the individual U.K. albums have enough merit to make them every bit as essential. In fairness, The Definitive Collection is the most thoroughly annotated compilation of the group's work to surface as of the year 2000, and the group interview, though superficial and awkward, makes it unique.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-manfred-mann-the-definitive-collection-r65916/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-manfred-mann-the-definitive-collection-r65916/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UXL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UXL&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
