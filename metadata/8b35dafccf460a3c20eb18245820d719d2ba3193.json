With 21 patterns and a special kid-friendly project, too, this book is 200+ pages of patterns and accompanying essays based on classic characters from literature. An accompanying website contains additional content, such as video links, links to audio content, and more. &quot;I love this book! A delight in literature, crafts, friendship, and creativity is channeled through original knitting patterns. It took me on a journey of sharing, joy, discovery, and whimsy that left me exhilarated. It's like CraftLit in a book!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b35dafccf460a3c20eb18245820d719d2ba3193","amp;dn":"What+%28Else%29+Would+Madame+Defarge+Knit%3F+28+More+Patterns+and+Essa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b35dafccf460a3c20eb18245820d719d2ba3193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,53,218,252,207,70,10,60,32,235,24,36,88,32,215,25,210,186,49,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
