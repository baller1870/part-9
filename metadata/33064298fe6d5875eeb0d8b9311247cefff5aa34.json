He began music when he was in his 14. His passion for music led him to leave Iran in the age of 11 and begin his musical education in classical jazz at the Royal Society of Arts in London, England, where he majored in jazz. He worked with some popular bands in England such as the Rebels and the Insects as a pianist and singer. When he returned to Iran at the age of 25, he started his career mainly as a composer. Ghomayshi has created numerous melodies and lyrics for famous Persian artists such as Ebrahim Hamedi(Ebi),Zia and Betty. Ghomayshi wrote his first song, called &quot;Boatman,&quot; for Zia when he was a 14 year old. Although initially considered a composer, in the latter years of the Pahlavi regime (before the 1979 Islamic Revolution) he released his first album, and has since continued his work as a singer, composer, arranger, and lyricist. In 1972 he released his first album, Farangis, in Iran. He lived in Iran until the age of 34 and then -- given the uncertain status of those involved in the music business following the Islamic revolution of Iran -- he decided to leave the country once again to pursue his career, and this time his destination was United States.\n\n\n\n\nTrack list:\n\n\n(Aroosake Shab)\n01- Aroosake Shab 1\n02- Aroosake Shab 2\n03- Asir\n04- Avareh\n05- Dige Fayde Nadare\n06- Divooneh\n07- Doozakhi 1\n08- Doozakhi 2\n09- Ey Reside Az Rah\n10- Gharibeh\n11- Gheseye Amir\n12- Ghesse\n13- Gheseye Golo Tagarg\n14- Ghorbat 1\n15- Ghorbat 2\n16- Instrumental\n17- Kash az aval 2\n18- Khosh Khial (Music)\n19- Lahazeha\n20- Mabade Shahid\n21- Mitarsam\n22- Mosafer\n23- Omre 2 Rooze\n24- Sarab\n25- Peyda Nemishe\n26- Piano\n27- Pichak (Music)\n28- Pichak\n29- Rooze Barfi\n30- Sarnevesht\n31- Sedaghat\n32- Sedaye Ghadimaa\n33- Tane Zakhmi\n34- Tolo\n35- Zemzeme\n36- hasrat alood\n37- jazireh\n38- khaali (Music)\n39- khorshide khazan\n40- Paeez\n41- Parastoo\n42- sayeh\n\n\n\n(Farangis)\n01- Paeez\n02- Hobab\n03- Khosh Khial\n04- Tolo \n05- Khial\n06- Tanha\n07- Faseleh\n08- Gharghabeh Dard\n09- Ba Ham\n10- Farangis\n\n\n\n(Khabe Baroon)\n01- Az Maast Ke Bar Maast \n02- Farangis\n03- Saayeh\n04- Ghorbat\n05- Khabe Baroon\n06- Peyvastegi \n07- Hediyeh\n08- Music (Az Maast Ke Bar Maast)\n\n\n\n(Hekaayat)\n01- Hekaayat\n02- Parandehaay e Ghafasi\n03- Az Eshgh e Tou\n04- Har Do Maa\n05- Shekaayat\n06- Bachehaa\n07- Oon Roozhaa\n08- Daryaay e Toofaan\n09- Gom Kardeh\n10- Choopaan\n\n\n\n(Taak)\n01- Taak\n02- Fardaa\n03- Baagh e Baaroon Zadeh\n04- Cheshm Entezaar \n05- Gereh e Gom \n06- Setaareh\n07- Music (Taak)\n\n\n\n(Gheseye Amir)\n01- Gheseh e Amir\n02- Aadat\n03- Mosaafer\n04- Biyaa Bargard\n05- Saraab\n06- Kaash Az Aval\n07- Music (Gheseh e Amir)\n08- Music (Kaash Az Aval)\n09- Music (Biyaa Bargard)\n\n\n\n(City Of The Sun)\n01- City Of The Sun\n02- Mountain Palace\n03- Illuminata\n04- Moon Gate\n05- Mirror Avenue\n06- Shadows In Time\n07- The Crown\n08- Faces In Stone\n09- The Riddle\n10- Inside The Circle\n11- Children Of The Dawn\n\n\n\n(Gheseye Golo Tagarg)\n01- Ghoroob\n02- Fasl e Paaeez\n03- Rooz e Barfi\n04- Faaseleh\n05- Che Dardist\n06- Gheseye Gol o Tagarg\n\n\n\n(Havaye Khooneh)\n01- Havaye Khooneh\n02- Tolu\n03- Jazireh\n04- Naameh\n05- Panjereh\n06- Do Deli\n\n\n\n(Shokofehaaye Kaviri)\n01- Baroon\n02- Jazireh\n03- Deltangi\n04- Zamzameh\n05- Teflaki\n06- Zendegi\n07- Irooni\n08- Baroon(Music)\n09- Irooni(Music)\n\n\n\n(Ghaab e Shisheie)\n01- Ghaab e Shisheie\n02- Baa Man Baash\n03- Golhaay e Pooneh\n04- Geleh\n05- Divooneh\n06- RosvaaTarin Aashegh\n\n\n\n(Hadeseh)\n01- Khaar\n02- Haadeseh\n03- Rang e Dirooz\n04- Gharn e Maa\n05- Gharibeh\n06- Ghanari\n07- Sokoot\n08- Baaz Aa\n09- Mard e Khodaa\n\n\n\n(Neghab)\n01- Neghab\n02- Khatereh\n03- Barg\n04- Khasteh Shodam\n05- Faseleh\n06- Milad\n07- Aakharin Nameh\n\n\n\n(Bee Sarzamin Taar Az Baad)\n01- Bee Sarzamin Taar Az Baad\n02- Laanat\n03- Parse\n04- Asal Banoo\n05- Ageh Toe Beri\n06- Daryaaye Maghreb\n07- Nafas Bekesh\n\n\n\n(Roozhaye Bikhatereh)\n01- Booseh e Baad\n02- Geryeh Kon\n03- Panjereh\n04- Tasavar Kon\n05- Mahboobeh e Shab\n06- Hanooz\n07- Yaad e Man Baas\n08- Booseh e Baad (Club Mix)\n\n\n\n(Sunset To Sunrise)\n01- Farangis\n02- Khabe Baroon\n03- Faseleh\n04- Tolou\n05- Baroon\n06- Ghoroub\n\n\nwww.upersia.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33064298fe6d5875eeb0d8b9311247cefff5aa34","amp;dn":"Siavash+Ghomeishi+Discography+%28Persian+Music%29%5Bwww.upersia.com%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33064298fe6d5875eeb0d8b9311247cefff5aa34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,6,66,152,254,109,88,117,238,176,216,185,49,18,71,206,255,245,170,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
