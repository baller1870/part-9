His captor is Earl Ragnar. a Danish chieftain, who raises the boy as his own, teching him the Viking ways of war. As a young man expected to partake in raids and bloody massacers of the English, he grapples with divided loyalties, torn between Ragnar, the warrior he loves like a father, and Alfred (the English king), whose piety and introspection leave him cold. It takes a terrible slaughter and the unexpected joys of marriage for Uhtred to discover his true self - and to rise to his greatest challenge.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff822ccce835f5b7eeef2d22b88a5ebec9316f15","amp;dn":"%5Banti-hero%5D+Bernard+Cornwell+-+The+Last+Kingdom+-+64kb+%28re-seed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff822ccce835f5b7eeef2d22b88a5ebec9316f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,130,44,204,232,53,245,183,238,239,45,34,184,138,94,190,201,49,111,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
