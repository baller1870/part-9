This would include the Anti-Semite Mel Gibson, or the America-hating Sean Penn or Alec Baldwin. The top of that list has to be Hanoi Jane Fonda; her actions were inexcusably treasonous. Still, she is a fine actress and this film from 1965 is one of the best comedies ever made. So, instead of ruminating on that, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll call attention to the brilliant Oscar-winning comedic performance of Lee Marvin. For those who have never seen the film, MarvinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s portrayal of a drunken gunfighter is one of the most famous and iconic comedic roles ever filmed. Fonda is basically just the generic woman in a dress, the role could have been played by anybody, but nobody will EVER forget Marvin in this movie.\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Cat Ballou.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,676 KB or 733,876,224 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:36:06 (138,240 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 905 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 105 kb/s (52/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 576x320 (1.80:1) [=9:5] \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059017/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059017/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_ballou&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_ballou&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCat Ballou is a 1965 comedy-western film which tells the story of a woman who hires a famous gunman to avenge her father&amp;#039;s murder, but finds that the man she hires isn&amp;#039;t what she expected. The movie stars Jane Fonda, Lee Marvin (in his Oscar-winning dual role), Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman, Nat King Cole, and Stubby Kaye.\n\nThe screenplay was adapted by Walter Newman and Frank Pierson from the novel by Roy Chanslor. The film was directed by Elliot Silverstein. The novel was originally a serious Western, but was turned into a comedy for the movie.\n\n\n Synopsis\nCatherine Ballou, an aspiring schoolteacher, is traveling by train to Wolf City, Wyoming, to visit her rancher father, Frankie Ballou. En route she unwittingly helps accused cattle rustler Clay Boone elude his captor, the sheriff, when Boone&amp;#039;s Uncle Jed, a drunkard disguised as a preacher, distracts the lawman. She reaches the ranch to find that the Wolf City Development Corporation is trying to take the ranch away from her father, whose only defender is an educated Indian, Jackson Two-Bears. Clay and Jed appear and reluctantly offer to help Catherine. She also wires legendary gunfighter Kid Shelleen to come and help protect her father from fast-drawing Tim Strawn, alias Silvernose, the hired killer who is threatening Frankie. Shelleen arrives, a drunken stumblebum who is literally unable to hit the side of a barn when he shoots and whose pants fall down when he draws his gun. Strawn kills Frankie, but the townspeople refuse to bring him to justice, and Catherine becomes a revenge-seeking outlaw known as Cat Ballou. She and her four associates rob a train carrying the Wolf City payroll, and Shelleen, inspired by his love for Cat (unrequited because she loves Clay), shapes up and kills Strawn. Later he casually admits that Strawn was his brother. Cat poses as a prostitute and confronts town boss Sir Harry Percival, owner of the Wolf City Development Corporation. A struggle ensues; Harry is killed; and Cat is sentenced to be hanged on the gallows. Just after the noose is placed around her neck, Uncle Jed (again as a fake preacher) cuts the rope as she falls through the trapdoor. Her gang then spirits her away in a daring rescue.\n\n\n Cast\nJane Fonda as Cat Ballou. \nLee Marvin as Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn. \nMichael Callan as Clay Boone. \nDwayne Hickman as Jed. \nNat King Cole as The Sunrise Kid and Stubby Kaye as Professor Sam the Shade. (The pair, billed onscreen simply as Shouters, intermittently narrate the story through verses of the Ballad of Cat Ballou.) \nTom Nardini as Jackson Two-Bears. \nJohn Marley as Frankie Ballou. \nReginald Denny as Sir Harry Percival. \nTucson Bar (AKA Amigo) as Drunk Horse. \n\n Influence\nCat Ballou is the favorite film of comedy directors Bobby &amp; Peter Farrelly (The Farrelly Brothers), as stated in The AFI 100 Years, 100 Laughs special. The Balladeers from There&amp;#039;s Something About Mary are inspired by the similar characters in Cat Ballou.  \nImagery from the hanging scene of Jane Fonda was used in spoofs advocating her execution for treason following her 1972 visit to Hanoi to support the communist Vietnamese in their war against the United States (after which she has been dubbed &quot;Hanoi Jane&quot;). A very brief shot from that scene was also used as part of Alex DeLarge&amp;#039;s sadistic reverie in the movie version of A Clockwork Orange. \n\n Awards and honors\n\n Awards won\n1965 Best Actor in a Leading Role - Marvin \n1965 British Academy Award Winner for Best Actor - Marvin \n1965 Golden Globe Award Winner for Best Actor - Marvin \nWinner of the Best Actor Prize at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival - Lee Marvin \n\n Nominations\nBest Film Editing \nBest Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment \nBest Music, Song - Jerry Livingston and Mack David for &quot;The Ballad of Cat Ballou&quot; \nBest Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. \n\n Honors\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Cat Ballou was acknowledged as the tenth best film in the western genre.\n\n\n Background\nNat King Cole died of lung cancer several months before the film was released. He started showing symptoms of the disease on the film.\n\nAmong many others, Kirk Douglas turned down the role of Shelleen; ironically, many years later he would play a similar double role in The Man from Snowy River. Jack Palance desperately wanted the role but was never offered it.\n\nAnn-Margret was first choice for the title role but turned it down.\n\nAt his acceptance at the Oscars, Lee Marvin opened by saying, &quot;Half of this Oscar belongs to a horse someplace out in the valley&quot;.\n\nIn the film&amp;#039;s beginning, the Columbia Pictures &quot;Torch Lady&quot; did a quick-change into a cartoon Cat Ballou, who drew and fired her sixguns into the air.\n\n\n Goofs\nNat King Cole and Stubby Kaye, who sing and play the banjo in the beginning of the film, are quite obviously not playing their instruments. \nKid Shelleen mistakenly sings &quot;Happy Birthday To You&quot; when he sees the candles on Frankie Ballou&amp;#039;s coffin. The tune was published as a kindergarten song &quot;Good Morning To All&quot; in 1893 (the movie takes place in 1894), but it&amp;#039;s doubtful the song would have spread to the wild West within a year; but, more importantly, the &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; lyrics didn&amp;#039;t appear until 1924. \nThere is a scene later in the movie in which Lee Marvin is shooting objects thrown into the air (the second time). If one pays attention to the background, right after he shoots a stick, it is possible to see a small plane in the sky.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98198a72dad277d9660702865cc8cab14aa51435","amp;dn":"Cat+Ballou+-+1965+Comedy+Lee+Marvin+-+Nat+King+Cole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98198a72dad277d9660702865cc8cab14aa51435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,25,138,114,218,210,119,217,102,7,2,134,92,200,202,177,74,165,20,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
