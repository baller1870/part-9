This is the tool i use to create \n3D Text, Titles, Logos, etc. Presentation/1st impression is an important aspect \nof graphics/design. This plugin will help you easily create 3D titles, text, \netc. Unlike most plugins, you will actually use this! For more info. refer to \nscreenshot or visit: http://www.digitalanarchy.com/3Dinvig/main.html\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Frischluft Flair Plugin Pack (v1.23)\nFlair brings 8 high quality effects, among them shine, glow and sparkle effects. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.frischluft.com/flair/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.frischluft.com/flair/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Talk-Mania Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Grafpedia Styles, Gradients, Color Pallete/Table, and Actions.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ and other personal Styles, and Actions from my personal collection.\n* I did not just install these additional plugins, but i tested for \n'Stealthiness' to ensure nothing is left behind.\n\nHow to Install More    :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ You can install more plugins by installing into:\nAdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Plug-ins.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Same goes for Styles, Actions, Filters, etc.. just install to corresponding\nfolder in AdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fonts: install on PC and Photoshop will detect. I highly recommend a font\nmanager so you don't have to install on your computer. I use 'Nexus Font' \n(freeware) because it's 'Stealth', and 'Portable'.!\n\nOptional               :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ You can delete any language you don't need to save a few mb of space.\nNavigate to: AdobePSPortable &gt; App &gt; Photoshop &gt; Locales.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ You can greatly enhance Photoshop's performance by adjusting the RAM in \nsettings.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If you experience slow startup, check your plugins, you may have too many.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ This includes the latest updates as of December 23, 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:879664f159f3d02cbb200c12d6f1e30af91c0e7b","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CS5.1+Portable+Multilingual+%28PAF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"879664f159f3d02cbb200c12d6f1e30af91c0e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,150,100,241,89,243,208,44,187,32,12,18,214,241,227,10,249,28,14,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
