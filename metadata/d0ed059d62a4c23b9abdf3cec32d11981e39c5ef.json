There is a texture contrast between crisp and smooth. The vegetables are always brightly coloured. Keeping these requirements in mind the recipes have been arranged in an orderly manner to achieve the desired results. In order to retain the colour and crunch of vegetables they have to be cut correctly, exposing the maximum surface to help them to cook faster, which keeps them crunchy. There is a special section on techniques for cutting vegetables and information on special equipment, ingredients and sauces used in Chinese cooking. Enjoy the taste of China, all cooked in a simple manner in your own kitchen!\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 4\nInternational Conversion Guide 5\nChinese Ingredients and Sauces 6\nChinese Cooking Utensils 9\nVegetable Cutting Methods 10\n\nAppetizers 12\nSweet Corn Vegetable Soup 13\nHot &amp; Sour Soup 14\nKimchi Salad 15\nChicken Spring Rolls 16\nSteamed Dimsums 18\nCorn Rolls 20\nGolden Fried Prawns 21\n\nSaucy Dishes 22\nVeggies in Szechwan Sauce 23\nAmerican Chopsuey with Vegetables 26\nSweet and Sour Vegetables 29\nSpicy Ginger Honey Fish 30\nChicken in Black Pepper Sauce 32\nChicken in Hot Garlic Sauce 33\n\nDry &amp; Stir Fried 34\nDry Chilli Chicken 35\nSpicy Honey Veggies 37\nHoisin Stir Fry Okra 39\nStir fried Snow PeasiBeans 41\nCrispy Honey Chicken 42\nChilli Garlic Noodles 44\nShrimp Egg Rice 45\n\nDessert 46\nToffee Apples 46\nGlossary of Names/Terms 48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ed059d62a4c23b9abdf3cec32d11981e39c5ef","amp;dn":"hta%27s+Chinese+Cooking+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ed059d62a4c23b9abdf3cec32d11981e39c5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,237,5,157,98,164,194,59,154,189,243,206,195,45,17,152,30,57,197,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
