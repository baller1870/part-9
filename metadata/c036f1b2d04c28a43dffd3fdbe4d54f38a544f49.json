All the world's computers are infected. Everything from cars to payment systems and, of course, computers and smart phones stop functioning, and with them go essential functions including emergency services, transportation, and the food supply. Billions may die.\n\nBut evolution never stops. The virus continues to evolve, developing intelligence, communication, and finally an entire civilization.\n\nSome may be friendly to humans, but others are not.
