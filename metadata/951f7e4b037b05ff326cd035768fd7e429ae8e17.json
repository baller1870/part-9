You will be mining resources, automating production, managing energy sources, designing the flow of items in your factory, researching technologies and defending from hostile creatures.\n\nWhat is the game inspired by?\nWe drew a lot of inspiration from Transport Tycoon-like games, Civilization and Minecraft.\n\nWhy should I care?\nThis game is made by geeks for geeks. The core of the game is building things. You can create huge almost self sufficient factories. There are machines crafting other machines. All the stuff is travelling on transport belts. There are simple means of &quot;programming&quot; the robotic arms that move things around. You also have little logistic robots that transport things among designated containers. The ultimate goal of course is to have self replicating factories:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:951f7e4b037b05ff326cd035768fd7e429ae8e17","amp;dn":"Factorio+v0.12.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"951f7e4b037b05ff326cd035768fd7e429ae8e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,31,126,75,3,123,5,255,50,108,208,53,118,143,215,228,41,174,142,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
