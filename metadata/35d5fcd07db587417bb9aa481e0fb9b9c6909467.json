Harry Angstrom--known to all as Rabbit, one of America's most famous literary characters--finds his dreary life shattered by the infidelity of his wife, Janice. How he resolves or further complicates his problems makes for a novel of the first order.\n\n&quot;Updike owns a rare verbal genius, a gifted intelligence and a sense of tragedy made bearable by wit....A masterpiece.&quot; -- Time\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nUpdike's most famous work is his Rabbit series. Both Rabbit Is Rich and Rabbit At Rest received the Pulitzer Prize. He published more than twenty novels and more than a dozen short story collections, as well as poetry, art criticism, literary criticism and children's books. Hundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in The New Yorker, starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for The New York Review of Books.\nHis novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal. He died in January 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d5fcd07db587417bb9aa481e0fb9b9c6909467","amp;dn":"RABBIT+REDUX+-+John+Updike.+Read+by+Arthur+Morey+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d5fcd07db587417bb9aa481e0fb9b9c6909467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,213,252,208,125,181,135,65,123,185,170,72,30,15,185,185,198,144,148,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
