His identity within can be kept secret as the scanning suit he dons \r\nhides his true identity. In reality, he is Bob Arctor. His assignment is \r\nto infiltrate a drug ring dealing in a hallucinogen known as Substance D, \r\nthe ultimate goal to find the source of the drug. Arctor's own use of \r\nSubstance D and moving within this drug world is making him lose his true \r\nidentity, which includes a family life with two young daughters. As Fred, \r\nhe is also assigned to monitor his own movements since one of Arctor's \r\ndrug colleagues, James Barris, has come to the authorities to report \r\nArctor's drug dealings, although Fred's superior, code named Hank, knows \r\nthat Fred in his true identity is one of the people in the drug ring being \r\nmonitored. But Hank and Hank's colleagues will do anything, even sacrifice \r\nFred/Arctor, to achieve the ultimate goal of finding the source of \r\nSubstance D.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Keanu Reeves.\r\n=&gt;-Winona Ryder.\r\n=&gt;-Robert Downey Jr.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Richard Linklater.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Sci-Fi : Mystery : Animation.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2006.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.58 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 254 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 40mn.\r\n=&gt;-A Scanner Darkly 2006......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scanner_darkly/\r\n=&gt;-A Scanner Darkly 2006......: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-scanner-darkly/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 1072.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2 121 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 199 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09e9073a62360474ead96efb9183e7ff0e07189","amp;dn":"A+Scanner+Darkly+-+Keanu+Reeves+Animation+2006+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09e9073a62360474ead96efb9183e7ff0e07189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,158,144,115,166,35,96,71,78,173,150,239,185,24,62,127,240,224,113,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
