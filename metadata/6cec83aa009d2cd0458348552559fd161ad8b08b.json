With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's signature track, &quot;Echoes&quot;. Although many of the group's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each\nmember.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.One of these days                                    [05:57]\n02.A pillow of winds                                    [05:11]\n03.Fearless                                             [06:08]\n04.San tropez                                           [03:43]\n05.Seamus                                               [02:16]\n06.Echoes                                               [23:28]\n____\n\n46:43 min\n 68,2 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cec83aa009d2cd0458348552559fd161ad8b08b","amp;dn":"Pink_Floyd-Meddle-%28Retail%29-1971-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cec83aa009d2cd0458348552559fd161ad8b08b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,236,131,170,0,157,44,208,69,131,72,85,37,89,253,22,26,216,176,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
