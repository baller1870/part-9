When he was a just an infant, he and eight other Lorien\ninfants escaped from Lorien when the planet was overrun by the marauding\nMogadorians, who killed all the other Loriens. Each of the nine was assigned\na protector warrior, John's being Henri. The nine are all on Earth, but each\nhas no idea the whereabouts of the other eight. The Mogadorians are out to\nfind and kill the nine in order, John who is number four. His and Henri's move\nto Paradise was after John felt that number three was killed, meaning that he\nwill be next. Although John is aware of his heritage, he only knows life on\nEarth as being his true history, and thus has many of those wants of the\nAmerican teenager. Their move to Paradise coincides with John beginning to\nunderstand that he has special powers, which was why he was one of the chosen\nnine. Although Henri wants him to stay under the radar, John has a less than\nan inauspicious introduction to life in Paradise, largely because of his\nassociations with classmates. One is with Sam, who is the oft picked upon\nboy, largely because his father, who long went missing, had always believed\nin extraterrestrial life, that belief which he passed onto Sam. The other is\nSarah Hart, the first girl to who John has ever been attracted. The issue\nwith Sarah is that she is the ex-girlfriend of Mark James, the football\nteam's quarterback and chief bully who still wants Sarah back despite he\nhaving bad mouthed her publicly since their break-up. John's notoriety in\ncombination with the problems of John dealing with the regular issues of\nteenaged life may make John and Henri easier to find by the Mogadorians,\nand thus place the lives of all those in Paradise in danger. All the while,\nHenri continues with his primary other mission which is to help John find\nthe remaining five, who in combination can better battle the Mogadorians.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Alex Pettyfer.\n=&gt;-Timothy Olyphant.\n=&gt;-Dianna Agron.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-D J Caruso.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre........................: Action : Adventure : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date.................: 2011.\n=&gt;-Language.....................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size....................: 1.52 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate.............: 1 983 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime................: 1h 49mn.\n=&gt;-I Am Number Four.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_number_four/\n=&gt;-I Am Number Four.............: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-number-four/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio.................: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution...................: 1920 x 1036 pixels.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.....................: 1850 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.....................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.....................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate.............: 163 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd68a5eccd24eb1ab529fe4ace03ae39366c6b65","amp;dn":"I+Am+Number+Four+-+Sci-Fi+Adventure+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd68a5eccd24eb1ab529fe4ace03ae39366c6b65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,104,165,236,205,36,235,26,181,41,254,74,206,3,174,57,54,108,107,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
