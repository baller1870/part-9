(These are discourses nr. 13, 14, 19).\r\nCorresponding original text of these discourses is in 3 attached files.\r\n\r\nHere is example of editing Question 4 in discourse nr. 14\r\n\r\noriginal Question 4\r\n\r\n&quot;BELOVED Bhagwan,\r\nI SEEM TO BE SO UNCONSCIOUS SO MUCH OF THE TIME, SO VERY UNAWARE AND JUST SIMPLY INVOLVED IN LIFE AND LOVING LIVING IT.\r\nWHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE TOTALITY AND INTENSITY OF THE SEARCH, AND HOW NOTHING ELSE REALLY MATTERS, AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO LET NOTHING BECOME A DISTRACTION, I FEAR I WILL NEVER MANAGE IT.\r\nIN MY HEART I FEEL NOTHING ELSE DOES MATTER, YET I AM NOT LIVING IN THIS AWARENESS ALL THE TIME AND IN EVERY SITUATION.\r\nWOULD IT BE GOOD FOR ME TO TRY TO BRING THIS AWARENESS TO EACH AND EVERY MOMENT, EVEN IF IT REQUIRES INTENSE EFFORT? IF YOU FEEL THIS IS GOOD FOR ME, I WILL TRY IT EVEN THOUGH I AM AFRAID I MAY LOSE SOME OF THE FUN AND SPONTANEITY AND EASE OF JUST LIVING, AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MANAGE IT.&quot;\r\n\r\nA: Maitri, the question is significant for everybody. ....\r\n.............\r\n\r\nEdited Question 4\r\n\r\n&quot;Should I try to be aware all the time even if it means loosing some of the ease just living?&quot;\r\n\r\nA:(the name of the questioner is removed)..The question is signifficant for everybody. ...\r\n.....................................................................................................\r\n\r\nI feel this is unfair to Osho and to the people who want to get his message in original form as he was giving it in his discourses.It feels to me,like cheating.\r\nWe cannot trust anymore to osho.com. They are not spreading original Osho's work. They are mixing Osho's words creating more new books just to sell. \r\nPlease share original whenever you can","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:346c9653c3ad1c39ca5dab19e58d2ab903c29bf1","amp;dn":"Osho_+Beyond+Enlightenment_%2832+files%29%28non-edited%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"346c9653c3ad1c39ca5dab19e58d2ab903c29bf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,108,150,83,195,173,28,57,202,93,171,25,229,141,42,185,3,194,155,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
