Many common chemicals when mixed improperly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whether intentionally or not Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can pose serious consequences to those who come in contact with them. Written by an author who is an experiencedhazmat-qualifiedfirst responder,forensicspecialist, and educator, Explosives and Chemical Weapons Identification provides the means to quickly identify the type of explosive or chemical weapon at hand upon arriving at the scene.\n\nA thorough and accessible reference, this book contains the identification capabilities for 468 different formulations for explosives and chemical weapons. It presents detailed descriptions for each of these formulations by breaking down their materials into five concise categories: common name, synonym, class, ingredients, and use. The materials are also indexed by common name, class, and ingredient.\n\nA handy reference packed with critical information and over 350 illustrations and photographs to aid in visual identification, Explosives and Chemical Weapons Identification is an essential resource that every first responder and forensic professional must have within reach every time.\n\n\n\n\nReview\nThe design of the book was to be a primer for the First Responder in aiding them to identify explosive and chemical weapons. Mr. Crippin has more than accomplished his goal. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦The book is 'Field Ready', i.e., it is bound in such a manner (spiral binding) that allows it to be useful in the field as a working text and not a cumbersome reference book. The glossary itself serves as an easily followed self teaching guide about explosives and chemical weapons. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦This book definitely will serve the purpose of aiding the First Responder to make better decisions in the field and save time and hopefully lives.\n-Jay Tobin, Director of Forensic Sciences Division , Department of Maryland State Police, American Society of Crime Lab Directors Newsletter \n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Explosives-Chemical-Identification-Forensic-Techniques/dp/0849333385/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Explosives-Chemical-Identification-Forensic-Techniques/dp/0849333385/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTags: Sarin, VX, Tabun, Oman, Phosghene, Chlroine, Lewisite, Mustard, Germany, Syria, organo, organophosphate, bio,toxin, CNS, acetylcholine, cholinesterase, spine, cns, nerve, agent, nbc, cbrn, wmd, Assad, Russia, Novichok, Russia, United States, treaty, pralidixome, atropine, pam, autoinjecter, mopp, mopp 3, mopp4, chemwar, usamriid, bsl2, bsl3, bsl4, bsl5, chemistry, pesticide, nazi, ndsdp, ww1, ww2\nEducation,Reference,History,Military,Science,Law,Criminal Law,Forensic Science,Medical, medicine,Books,Internal Medicine,Dermatology, Law\nMedicine,Health,Sciences,Clinical,Dermatology,Science,Mathematics,Environmental Studies,Social Sciences,Military Sciences,security studies, political science\ndomestic,national,Politics,Criminology,Professional,Technical,Engineering,Special Topics,Biological Sciences,Biology,Earth,Sciences","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86112d2a4346623a32e24b99bdb56eaa55ed7aa3","amp;dn":"Explosives+and+Chemical+Weapons+Identification+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86112d2a4346623a32e24b99bdb56eaa55ed7aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,17,45,42,67,70,98,58,50,226,75,153,189,181,110,170,85,237,122,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
