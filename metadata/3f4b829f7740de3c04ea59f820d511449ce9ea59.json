A power-hungry group of renegades has teamed up with aliens, and together they are planning to assume control of the planet. You are a one-man army whose mission is to squash the rebellion. There are four characters to choose from: Marco, Eri, Tama, and Fio. At the beginning, you've only got a gun and a few grenades, which isn't going to be enough. But as you rescue hostages, new weapons like rocket launchers, flamethrowers, bouncing shots, Molotov cocktails, and a shotgun are at your disposal. In addition to new weapons, you will also have access to a variety of vehicles including the Super Vehicle-001 mini-tank, Camel Slug, Slug Flyer, and Slugnoid, each packed with special weapons and abilities. The world is counting on you to stop the terrorist threat in Metal Slug X.\n\n\nHappy Holidays to everyone and hope you enjoy my future releases......KloWn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f4b829f7740de3c04ea59f820d511449ce9ea59","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Metal+Slug+X+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-games+by+KloW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f4b829f7740de3c04ea59f820d511449ce9ea59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,75,130,159,119,64,222,60,4,234,89,248,32,213,17,68,156,233,234,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
