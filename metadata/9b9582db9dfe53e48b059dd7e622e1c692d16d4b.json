Their goal is to see people encounter God, be transformed by His presence and empowered to make a difference in their world. While they tour internationally, the team remains based out of Planetshakers City Church, a multi-campus, 7,800-member congregation in Melbourne that is pastored by husband and wife, Russell and Sam Evans.  The church is the fastest growing church in Australian history.\n\n\n\nTrack list:\n* Let Praise Awaken\n* Put Your Hands Up\n* Rain\n* Your Name Brings Healing To Me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9582db9dfe53e48b059dd7e622e1c692d16d4b","amp;dn":"PlanetShakers+-+Limitless+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9582db9dfe53e48b059dd7e622e1c692d16d4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,149,130,219,157,254,83,228,139,5,157,215,230,34,225,198,146,209,109,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
