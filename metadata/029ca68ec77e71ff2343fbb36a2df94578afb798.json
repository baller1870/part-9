Omar Sosa's album Eggun: The Afri-Lectric Experience began as a commission from the Barcelona Jazz Festival in 2009 to create a tribute performance to Miles Davis's classic Kind Of Blue on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Inspired by the album's various musical elements and motifs, Sosa wrote a suite of music honoring the spirit of freedom in Davis's seminal work, with jazz textures enriched by the subtle and expressive use of electronic elements. Special guests on the project include guitarist Lionel Loueke and percussionists Pedro Martinez and Gustavo Ovalles. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029ca68ec77e71ff2343fbb36a2df94578afb798","amp;dn":"Omar+Sosa+-+Eggun+The+Afri-Lectric+Experience+%5Bmp3-320-2013%5D%5Btrf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029ca68ec77e71ff2343fbb36a2df94578afb798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,156,166,142,199,126,113,255,35,67,251,179,106,45,249,69,120,175,183,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
