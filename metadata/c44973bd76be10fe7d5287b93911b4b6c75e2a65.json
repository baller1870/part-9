Referring to recording errors created by some faulty equipment, Harrison jokingly remarked to Lynne, &quot;We'll bury 'em in the mix&quot;.[1][2] Thereafter, they used the term for any small error in performance and the term was used again when the group were together. Harrison suggested &quot;The Trembling Wilburys&quot; as the group's name; instead, Lynne suggested &quot;Traveling&quot;, with which the group agreed.[1]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44973bd76be10fe7d5287b93911b4b6c75e2a65","amp;dn":"The+Traveling+Wilburys-9+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44973bd76be10fe7d5287b93911b4b6c75e2a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,73,115,189,118,190,16,254,125,82,135,185,57,17,180,182,199,94,42,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
