Taylor casts his life-size statues from a special kind of cement that facilitates reef growth, and sinks them to the ocean floor. There, over time, the artworks attract corals, algae, and fish, and evolve into beautiful and surreal installations that are also living reefs. This volume brings readers face to face with these wonders and explains the science behind their creation. Ocean enthusiasts, divers, art lovers, and anyone entranced by the natural world will be instantly engrossed by this pearl of a book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7c323abf6f0a263b27aacc050e2d5a3912cf70","amp;dn":"The+Underwater+Museum+-+The+Submerged+Sculptures+of+Jason+deCair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7c323abf6f0a263b27aacc050e2d5a3912cf70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,124,50,58,191,111,10,38,59,39,170,204,5,14,45,90,57,18,207,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
