Also made available in Main Game and added to crafting table.\n    We can now individually control mass, friction and restitution per chunk type. Meaning we can make Sap, Oleite and wheels bouncy!\n    Lowering profile of warning icons\n    New Resource assets\n    Updated localisation document.\n    General polish\n\nGame Design Tweaks:\n\n    Small changes to the fabricator example base.\n    Auto aim guns now reselect new targets more regularly.\n    Added Scrapper Cost Multiplier.\n    Removed the last of the ugly world space arrows from the challenge modes.\n    Warning overlays now have a curve to determine how often they should display.\n    Removed some buttons from the pause menu.\n    New block discovery overlays now appear on all undiscovered new blocks that get detached / are available.\n    Warning overlays now revert to a blinking state after their full warning message has been read at least once.\n    Block discovery overlays now dismiss when the target item is picked up.\n    Once an overlay has been expanded and read, players can click anywhere else to dismiss it, despite the state of the overlay.\n    Invaders are now removed from play when they defeat you.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n    Fixed issue where brakes arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t released on boost unless actually boosting.\n    TechÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s with only anchors count as legitimate and so will not self destruct.\n    Fixed Tech staying kinematic after anchor removed.\n    Made sure anchored Techs are always flat and always anchor when loading them back into games.\n    Made sure detached enemy AI controllers always destruct.\n    Fixed chunk duplication bug.\n    Fixed logic fail preventing unanchored tanks from clearing kinematic.\n    Fixed AI controllers trying to beam up fixed bases.\n    Unanchoring an anchored tech causes it to fall apart.\n    Anchored blocks set as root when no controller exists.\n    Fixed delivery cannon, more robust way to cancel holding animations, allow animated item to retain velocity on animation exit.\n    Fixed booster/brakes sticking bug.\n    Various fixes to Sumo including; Sumo spawn height &amp; centred, beam enable/disable conditions, game-breaking UI logic bug &amp; block decode message.\n    Fixed bug relating to anchors applying on all parts that could when spawning Techs. Now only ones that were anchored when the Tech was saved will re-anchor.\n    Fixed the tractor pad holding beams to hold items with a bit more strength so they are not dropped all the time when moving at speed.\n    Fixes to the issues with some Attach Points not showing when they should, during rebuilds.\n    Clean-up work has gone into the chunk drag and drop logic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4056ff88a35fe73001349f6e69afd12952c6126","amp;dn":"TerraTech+v0.4.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4056ff88a35fe73001349f6e69afd12952c6126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,5,111,248,138,53,254,115,0,19,73,246,230,154,253,18,149,44,97,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
