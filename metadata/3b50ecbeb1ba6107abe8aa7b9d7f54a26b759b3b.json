In this form, the equation can be solved. But what if the 2 is replaced with any positive integer greater than 2? Would the equation still be solvable? More than 300 years ago, amateur mathematician Pierre de Fermat said no, and claimed he could prove it. Unfortunately, the book margin in which he left this prophecy was too small to contain his thinking. Fermat&amp;#039;s Last Theorem has since baffled mathematicians armed with the most advanced calculators and computers. This programme chronicles the seven-year effort of one mathematician, Andrew Wiles, who methodically works in near isolation to determine the proof for this seemingly simple equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: DivX511\nVideo Bitrate: 1741 kb/s\nVideo Resolution: 416*304\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 4:3\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384kb/s. 48khz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: 46 Minutes\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 699 MB\nRipped by Radar\n\n\nRelated Documentaries\nAbsolute Zero [1] [2] [3] \nThe Pleasure of Finding Things Out [1] [2] [3] \nDangerous Knowledge [1] [2] \nEinstein&amp;#039;s Biggest Blunder [1] [2] [3] \nParallel Universes [1] [2] [3] [4] \nAn Experiment to Save the World [1] [2] [3] [4] \nElegant Universe [1] [2] [3] \nBlack Holes [1] [2] [3] \nBlack Holes and Black Magic [1] [2] \nAtom [1] [2] \nA Brief History of Time [1] [2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b50ecbeb1ba6107abe8aa7b9d7f54a26b759b3b","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+Fermats+Last+Theorem+DivX511+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b50ecbeb1ba6107abe8aa7b9d7f54a26b759b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,80,236,190,177,186,97,7,171,232,170,123,157,127,84,162,107,117,155,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
