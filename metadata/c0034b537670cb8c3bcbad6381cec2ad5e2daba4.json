The advancement of the human species is at stake. If, in fact, our national or international space exploration programs find evidence that there are alien races living in our solar system past or present, then it is critical that this information be shared not only with the public but with the whole scientific community. Advancements in distant space travel, alternative energy, environmental protection, and universal understandings are at stake.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 40 pages\nPublisher: Red Bear Publishing (October 10, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0989615316\nISBN-13: 978-0989615310\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0034b537670cb8c3bcbad6381cec2ad5e2daba4","amp;dn":"Space+Science+Cover-Ups+-+The+Truth+about+the+Moon%2C+Mars+and+Mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0034b537670cb8c3bcbad6381cec2ad5e2daba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,3,75,83,118,112,203,140,59,203,173,99,129,206,194,173,94,45,171,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
