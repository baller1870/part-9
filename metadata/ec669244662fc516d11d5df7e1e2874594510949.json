A live album was released following the \nbroadcast.\n\n\nBackground\n\nThe special consisted of a performance of many of Orbison's hits at the then Ambassador \nHotel's Cocoanut Grove nightclub (Los Angeles) in Los Angeles, filmed on September 30, 1987, \napproximately a year before his death. Three songs, &quot;Blue Bayou&quot;, &quot;Claudette&quot;, and &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, \nwere filmed but not included in the original broadcast due to time constraints.\n\nPut together by musical director T-Bone Burnett, Orbison was accompanied by a supporting \nbacking band which included many notable musical performers. All were fans who volunteered \nto participate in the special.[citation needed] Other celebrity admirers of Orbison were in \nthe audience, including Billy Idol, Patrick Swayze, Sandra Bernhard, and Kris Kristofferson. \nThe backing band was the TCB Band, which accompanied Elvis Presley from 1969 until his death \nin 1977: Glen D. Hardin on piano, James Burton on lead guitar, Jerry Scheff on bass, and \nRonnie Tutt on drums. Male background vocalists, some of whom also joined in on guitar, were \nBruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther, and Steven Soles. \nThe female background vocalists were k.d. lang, Jennifer Warnes, and Bonnie Raitt. During the \nend credits, several of the band members are shown talking about how Orbison influenced them.\n\nThe song &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; from this performance, which features dueling guitar solos between \nSpringsteen and Burton, was nominated for a Grammy Award for best live performance. Re-released \nas part of a CD bearing the same title as the motion picture, the song won the 1991 Grammy Award \nfor Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nThe audio from this special was released as an album by Virgin Records in 1989, \ntitled A Black &amp; White Night Live.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/SWVkK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/SWVkK.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks composed by Roy Orbison; except where indicated\n\n01 - &quot;Only The Lonely&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n02 - &quot;Dream Baby&quot; (Cindy Walker)\n03 - &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n04 - &quot;The Comedians&quot; (Elvis Costello)\n05 - &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; (Dick Penner, Wade Moore)\n06 - &quot;Leah&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n07 - &quot;Running Scared&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n08 - &quot;Uptown&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n09 - &quot;In Dreams&quot; (Orbison)\n10 - &quot;Crying&quot; (Orbison, Joe Melson)\n11 - &quot;Candy Man&quot; (Fred Neil, Beverly &quot;Ruby&quot; Ross)\n12 - &quot;Go Go Go (Down the Line)&quot;\n13 - &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; (Claude Demetrius)\n14 - &quot;(All I Can Do is) Dream You&quot; (Billy Burnette, David Malloy)\n15 - &quot;Claudette&quot; (Orbison)\n16 - &quot;It's Over&quot; (Orbison, Bill Dees)\n17 - &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; (Orbison, Bill Dees)\n\nPersonnel\n\nRoy Orbison: lead vocals, guitar, harmonica\nGlen D.
