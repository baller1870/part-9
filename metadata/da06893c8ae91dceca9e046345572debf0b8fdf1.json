Hopefully for you too!\nHowever, by adding your own mods to it, you risk making it unstable.\nMost addon cars and tracks should work fine. The mod uses &quot;LE2MWM&quot;.\nStarting money are now changed from 20 000$ to 50 000$ to make the carreer mode \npossible with the new more expensive cars.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[KNOWN BUGS]\n1:\nIf you have activated the ENB function. The screen will be all blurry at startup \nand when you return from a minimized window. Just hit shift+insert to shut it \noff and re-activate it again while on the track. The problem is only in menus and garage.\n\n2:\nThe Audi RS4 Avant doesn't come with a complete engine\n\n3:\nThe steering wheel of the Old Beetle is somewhat skewered\n\n4:\nWhile loading Valo City in carreer mode, you might need to minimize your window real quick and then\nmaximize it again to get it in to the track. This problem only occurs in carreer mode for some reason.\n\n5:\nThe Jeep doesn't come with all the rear windows when you buy the whole vehicle. The Audi RS4 Avant will\nmiss its engine when you buy it. I suggest you throw in the Audi 3.0 TFSI V6!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[NEW CARS]\nAll the original cars are removed from the ingame vehicle catalog. \nYou won't find them taking up space at the dealer either.\nIF you would see them, it might be because of you adding a new car mod. \n\nThe new cars are:\n\nBMW M3 E46\nBMW M5 E39\nMercedes Benz C63 AMG\nChevrolet Avalanche\nMitsubishi Lancer EVO VI\nMitsubishi Lancer EVO X\nVolkswagen Old Beetle\nAudi RS4 Avant (updated since v3)\nPontiac GTO '69 (+ &quot;the judge&quot;)\nNissan Skyline GTR-V R35\nHonda Civic EK9\nJeep Grand Cherokee SRT8-12\nMercedes Benz 190E\nDodge RAM SRT-10\nSubaru Impreza STi\nChrysler PT Cruiser\nDodge Viper SRT-10\nHonda NSX\nBuick Regal\n\nAll cars will not be obtainable by the dealers. However they are all available through the vehicle\ncategory in the catalog. Cars that might mess up night races will not be &quot;bots&quot;, Unfortunately a lot\nof Old beetles will race in the first race club. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[New cheats]\n\n    timemachine - a day of ROC\n    fastpromotion - get you to next team\n    ilikecheating - enable cheat keys\n\n[Keyboard]\nKeys are active only on tracks!\n\n1 - Time speed down\n2 - Time speed up\n3 - Time PauseUnpause\n4 - Rotate camera mode\n0 - Mirror (it's very early alpha)\n\nTAB - ShowHide OSD\nB - Look back\nM - ShowHide Map\n\nNumpad 0-9 - Pneumatic suspension\n\nF9 - Free Camera\nPgUp, PgDn, Numpad-, Numpad+ - Free camera control\n\n[CHEAT KEYS]\nF6 - Manual repairpaint Car\nF10 - Repair, tank nitroflip car\nF11 - Get new car (you carrier car will be teleport to the carlot\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Rivals]\nSome tracks require one or more saved cars to work as intended. I included a few.\n\nHere's how to do your own!\n\nDrag Track:\nYou need to create a car and save it as DragCar for this track to work. \nThe saved car will be used by the computer AI. (Default drag tuned old beetle)\n\nCoast:\nIf you want to race against Rivals (optional thanks to the selector). \nYou need to save cars with names Coast, Coast1, Coast2 etc. (I included those, overwrite with new\nsave if you want to change it.\n\nAkagi track:\nIf you want to race with a rival, save a car named AkagiCar (Default JDM tuned Honca Civic EK9)\n\nNevada Freestyle dift track:\nIf you want to race with other cars. Create and save cars as nevabot1, nevabot2 etc. (Default Swedenring EVO6)\n\nTop gear test track:\nSave a car as STIG if you want to choose the opponent car. Default is Skyline GTR-V R35\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[ENB] - requires high end gpu! (NVIDIA is recommended)\nThis modpack includes a graphics mod. It is off by default. If you want to activate it, do like this:\nIn the slrr folder, open enbseries.ini\nIn the &quot;[GLOBAL]&quot; section, type 1 instead of 0 at &quot;UseEffect=0&quot;\nHit save and close.\nActivate or de-activate ingame using shift+insert (It will now be active ingame by default.\n\nBut first!\nCreate a custom setup in NVIDIA control panel for the Street Legal application.\n(Manage 3D settings -&gt; Program Settings -&gt; Add Street legal and do the following:\nAntialiasing gamma correction - ON\nAntialiasing Mode - Override any application setting\nAntialiasing Setting - 32x CSAA\nAntialiasing Transparency - 8x (supersample)\n\nIngame video settings for &quot;good&quot; graphics\nMake sure you have  color depth set to &quot;32&quot; in the games video settings\n1024ptx should be activated on texture details and shadow details\nplay around with the sliders as you like. Detail settings all the way up ofcourse :)\nLet &quot;Loading primary&quot; stay on default.\n\nIf you want a higher resolution than you can select ingame. \nUse MWM resoultion changer in the Street legal directory to use ex. 1650x1050. \n(i have used 2880x1800 on my Macbook retina!!)\n\nTo control the ENB ingame:\nShift + insert -&gt; Activate/de-activate ENB\nScroll lock -&gt; Activate/de-activate SweetFX (better details and lightning)\nShift F10 -&gt; Activate/de-activate SSAO (smoother shadows on details)\n\nIf you experience heavy fps-drops. Try playing with only SweetFX and the NVIDIA application settings.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[SLRR Editor]\nIf you want to use a certain engine in a car that is not supported by default, you can use SLRR editor!\nIt is included in the Street legal dir. U need .NET framework 2.0 or higher to run it.\nFire it up, choose the street legal exe and start experimenting on your own risk!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[ENGINE SCRIPT]\nIF the engine doesn't fit the cars engine bay, wich is quite often unfortunately. \nYou can use a little trick i included. Select the screwdriver (fine tuning tool) and click \non the engines oilpan. That lets you adjust the placement of the engine!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[ENGINE SOUNDS]\nOn the i4, i6 and stock v8 engines, you will hear different sounds depending on how the engines are tuned. \nThe i4 engines offers realistic blow off valve sounds and turbo whistle aswell!\n\nThe Devils V6 and V8 have a neat little option that lets you choose different sounds. \nYou choose by selecting the fine tuning tool (screw driver) \nand clicking on one of the exhaust headers on the engine.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.slrr-sweden.nu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.slrr-sweden.nu&lt;/a&gt;\nSvensk SLRR community\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da06893c8ae91dceca9e046345572debf0b8fdf1","amp;dn":"SLRR+by+Birger+v4+NEW+Street+Legal+with+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da06893c8ae91dceca9e046345572debf0b8fdf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,6,137,60,138,233,29,206,202,158,4,99,69,87,45,235,240,184,253,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
