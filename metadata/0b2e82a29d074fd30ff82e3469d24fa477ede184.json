They set unmatched standards for close, two-part harmonies and infused early rock &amp; roll with some of the best elements of country and pop music. Their legacy was and is felt enormously in all rock acts that employ harmonies as prime features, from the Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and legions of country-rockers to modern-day roots rockers like Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe (who once recorded an EP of Everlys songs together).\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-p4208/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-everly-brothers-p4208/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Michael Ribas):\n\nThe Everlys have been well served by no less than three multidisc collections in the nineties, but this extremely well-conceived set distilled the essential phases of their career onto a single CD (double LP) a full ten years before Heartaches and Harmonies appeared. It wisely starts with 12 prime Cadence hits and then continues with 11 excellent Warner Brothers singles and album tracks before winding down with the John Sebastian-penned &quot;Stories We Could Tell&quot; (from their RCA period). Along the way, the budget-conscious, non-completist fan is treated to one essential classic after another, great sound, and superb, lengthy liner notes by Mitchell Cohen. This modest little overview more than lives up to its name. &quot;Everly Brothers 101.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/24-original-classics-r6907&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/24-original-classics-r6907&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004P4XBWG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004P4XBWG&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
