Allan's backing band is almost always the Arrows (i.e., Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows), although the Arrows have never been a stable lineup.\n\nEarly Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows tracks were stereotypical instrumental surf numbers, with clear-as-a-bell guitar sounds and light, crisp drum work. Though these sides were good musically, and modestly successful commercially (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œApache '65ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ became a local radio hit), Allan would find his greatest success when his sound mutated soon thereafter.\nWhen Curb assigned soundtrack duties for biker film The Wild Angels to Allan and the Arrows, it would prove a breakthrough success. The song from the film's opening, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlues' ThemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (sometimes listed as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue's ThemeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), an aggressive, repetitive and very catchy instrumental showcasing Allan's new fuzzed-out (heavily distorted) guitar sound became their biggest hit (it was also one of the first songs Eddie Van Halen learned to play on brother Alex's guitar). The song stayed on the Billboard charts for 17 weeks (it peaked at #37); the single, backed with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBongo Party,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the soundtrack album both sold well. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8e1549eb0fcd64a67453a9bc5e05655577f6b75","amp;dn":"Davie+Allan+%26+The+Arrows+-+11+albums+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8e1549eb0fcd64a67453a9bc5e05655577f6b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,225,84,158,176,252,214,74,103,69,58,155,197,224,86,85,87,127,107,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
