This film follows the remarkable life of one giant hornet queen, as she emerges from hibernation and starts to build up a colony in an old temple garden. Her army of warriors terrorise the beautiful mountain valley in their constant struggle to find food for their hungry grubs.\n\nIn a series of dramatic pitched battles, the giant hornets massacre thousands of bees, but victory isn't always assured - one local honeybee fights back thanks to a remarkable defensive strategy, and suddenly it is the hornets that are dying. A beekeeper monk bears witness to the rising power of the giant hornet colony, and despite the hornet's attacks on his own bees, he reveals a deep respect for these incredible predators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0108822ba2290177792f92467b3eba43aaf7ba69","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+Buddha+Bees+and+the+Giant+Hornet+Queen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0108822ba2290177792f92467b3eba43aaf7ba69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,8,130,43,162,41,1,119,121,47,146,70,123,62,186,67,170,247,186,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
