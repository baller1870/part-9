Saito Yamagata thinks Mercury's position will make it an ideal orbit point for satellites that could someday create enough power to propel starships into deep space. He hires Dante Alexios to bring his dreams to life. Astrobiologist Victor Molina thinks the water at Mercury's poles may harbor evidence of life, and hopes to achieve fame and glory by proving it. Bishop Elliot Danvers has been sent by the religious sect, &quot;The New Morality&quot;, to keep close tabs on their endeavors, which threaten to produce results that contradict biblical teachings. \n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki, Arte Johnson, Moira Quirk\nLength: 10 hrs and 28 mins \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:05-06-05\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf4bf9f49247eb38ac11557934979186ce9f6914","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Mercury+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2318%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf4bf9f49247eb38ac11557934979186ce9f6914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,75,249,244,146,71,235,56,172,17,85,121,52,151,145,134,206,159,105,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
