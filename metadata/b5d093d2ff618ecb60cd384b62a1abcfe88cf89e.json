She began to study with Emilio del Rosario at the Music Institute of Chicago. Within 4 years she was enrolled for study of classical music at the Winnetka campus. Besides her extraordinary talent at the piano, Emily started to compose her own music at the age of three. At 8 years old, she had already composed more than 350 pieces, and much of her work - both composition and improvisation - is of the more difficult, 20th Century genre, including jazz. For her piece Northern Lights she won the ASCAP Foundation Morton Gould Young Composer Award for composers under 18 years of age. She also won the Rockford Area Music Industry Award (RAMI).\n\nBear has made six appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, played at the White House for President George W. Bush when she was 6, and played a complete Mozart concerto from memory with the Champaign-Urbana Symphony Orchestra.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d093d2ff618ecb60cd384b62a1abcfe88cf89e","amp;dn":"Emily+Bear+-+The+Love+In+Us+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d093d2ff618ecb60cd384b62a1abcfe88cf89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,208,147,210,255,97,142,203,96,205,56,75,98,161,171,207,232,140,248,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
