With\nthe new release of version 2.0, Microsoft has added powerful new features\nsuch as Master Pages and automatic site navigation, which make it one\nof the most powerful (yet easy-to-use) Web-development tools out there.\nAnd itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inexpensive. Although the professional versions of Visual Studio will\nset you back some, Visual Web Developer Express Edition will cost you only\nabout $100 and can be used to develop sophisticated ASP.NET applications,\nusing your choice of programming languages ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Visual Basic or C#.\nOne way to learn ASP.NET is to buy a beginning ASP.NET book. There are\nplenty of good ones out there, including (in all due modesty) my own\nASP.NET 2.0 All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies (published by Wiley, of\ncourse). But this book takes a different approach. Instead of belaboring the\nmyriad of details that go into ASP.NET programming, this book presents a\nseries of complete popular applications, such as a shopping cart and a forum\nhost, and explains in detail how these applications work. You can study these\napplications to see how real-world ASP.NET programming is done, and you\ncan even copy them to give your own applications a running start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4671512a98373af5e7229b82f668842c110321f","amp;dn":"ASP.NET+2.0+Everyday+Apps+for+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4671512a98373af5e7229b82f668842c110321f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,103,21,18,169,131,115,175,94,114,41,184,47,102,136,66,193,16,50,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
