It is complete and unabridged.\n\n\nPublisher's Summary\nA mysterious high-profile homicide in the nation's capital collides with the dark side of national security in David Baldacci's new, heart-stopping thriller. \nMason &quot;Mace&quot; Perry was a firebrand cop on the D.C. police force until she was kidnapped and framed for a crime. She lost everything - her badge, her career, her freedom-and spent two years in prison. Now she's back on the outside and focused on one mission: to be a cop once more. \nHer only shot to be a true blue again is to solve a major case on her own, and prove she has the right to wear the uniform. But even with her police chief sister on her side, she has to work in the shadows: A vindictive U.S. attorney is looking for any reason to send Mace back behind bars. \nThen Roy Kingman enters her life. Roy is a young lawyer who aided the poor until he took a high-paying job at a law firm in Washington. Mace and Roy meet after he discovers the dead body of a female partner at the firm. As they investigate the death, they start uncovering surprising secrets from both the private and public world of the nation's capital. \nSoon, what began as a fairly routine homicide takes a terrifying and unexpected turn-into something complex, diabolical, and possibly lethal.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c702b9d8b8038569f6ece51620e1d4348332a55c","amp;dn":"David+Baldacci+True+Blue+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c702b9d8b8038569f6ece51620e1d4348332a55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,2,185,216,184,3,133,105,246,236,229,22,32,225,212,52,131,50,165,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
