Then go forth and conquer the world using any and all means available to you. Exploit the New World for its cornucopia of riches and resources as you race towards imperial supremacy over the entire world. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be alone in your endeavors, however, as your Ministers are there to give useful advice whilst you retain the ultimate control over the fate of your nation and, eventually, the entire world.\n\nImperialism offers turn-based strategic gameplay in either a randomly generated world or in a scenario based on historic events. Choose from seven industrial powers including Great Britain, Hungary, Sardinia, Italy, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire and three different points of historical interest: the very beginnings of imperialism in 1820, in 1848 which was the year of tumultuous revolutions, or in 1882 and the nascent beginnings of the arms race that led up to the Great War. Take the reins of command and remake history as you dominate the world in Imperialism!\n\nMinimum system requirements: \nWindows XP or Windows Vista, 1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended), 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9, Mouse, Keyboard. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/imperialism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/imperialism&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53bed0eb903741f9f3e15f7943b141810e9ade6","amp;dn":"Imperialism+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53bed0eb903741f9f3e15f7943b141810e9ade6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,59,237,14,185,3,116,31,159,62,21,247,148,59,20,24,16,233,173,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
