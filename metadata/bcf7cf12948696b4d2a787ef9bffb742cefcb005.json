Although aimed at those with no previous knowledge, it is equally suitable for anyone wishing to brush up existing knowledge or refresh rusty 'school French' for a holiday or business trip. Key structures and vocabulary are introduced in 25 thematic units progressing from introducing yourself and dealing with everyday situations to looking for work and buying a house in France. The course covers all structures required for GCSE level and beyond. The emphasis is on communication throughout with important language structures introduced through dialogues on the accompanying recording. There are plenty of exercises to practice the language as it is introduced and tips throughout to help with pronunciation and grammar. Cultural information boxes give useful advice and information for anyone planning a trip to France. There is a revision unit at the back of the book so that learners can check their progress and review areas of difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe new edition retains the tried-and-tested structure of the lessons but has been updated to reflect changes such as the introduction of the euro and the internet. New features include an English-French vocabulary to go alongside the existing French-English vocabulary and reference to over 70 websites for sources of real French in use.\r\n\r\nThe page design has been improved and section headings given in English to make the course easier to use for the self-access learner. The accompanying recording has been increased to two accompanying cassettes or CDs amounting to approximately 150 minutes of listening material. The CDs and cassettes are available separately or in a pack with the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf7cf12948696b4d2a787ef9bffb742cefcb005","amp;dn":"Teach+Yourself+French+-+4th+Revised+Edition+%282003%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf7cf12948696b4d2a787ef9bffb742cefcb005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,247,207,18,148,134,150,180,210,167,135,239,155,255,183,66,206,252,176,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
