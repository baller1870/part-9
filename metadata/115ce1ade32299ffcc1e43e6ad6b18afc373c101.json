Weiss\n2011 | ISBN: 1861897928 | English | 176 pages | PDF | 3.25 MB\n\nBe it soft-serve, gelato, frozen custard, Indian kulfi or Israeli glida, some form of cold, sweet ice cream treat can found throughout the world in restaurants and home freezers. Though ice cream was once considered a food for the elite, it has evolved into one of the most successful mass-market products ever developed.\n\nIn Ice Cream, food writer Laura B. Weiss takes the reader on a vibrant trip through the history of ice cream from ancient China to modern-day Tokyo in order to tell the lively story of how this delicious indulgence became a global sensation. Weiss tells of donkeys wooed with ice cream cones, Good Humor-loving World War II-era German diplomats, and sundaes with names such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Over the TopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“George Washington.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Her account is populated with Chinese emperors, English kings, former slaves, women inventors, shrewd entrepreneurs, Italian immigrant hokey-pokey ice cream vendors, and gourmand American First Ladies. Today American brands dominate the world ice cream market, but vibrant dessert cultures like ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s continue to thrive, and new ones, like JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, flourish through unique variations.\n\nWeiss connects this much-loved food with its place in history, making this a book sure to be enjoyed by all who are beckoned by the siren song of the ice cream truck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:115ce1ade32299ffcc1e43e6ad6b18afc373c101","amp;dn":"Ice+Cream+-+A+Global+History+%28Food+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"115ce1ade32299ffcc1e43e6ad6b18afc373c101","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,92,225,173,227,34,153,255,204,30,67,230,173,107,24,175,195,115,193,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
