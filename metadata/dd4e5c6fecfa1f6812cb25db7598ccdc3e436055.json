I suggest listening to the recording with and without hadphones: with headphones one becomes aware of the subtle game of overdubbed parts, without, you get the beauty of the whole. What strikes me most is Evans' ability to perfectly complement HIMSELF through overdubbed takes. I strongly recommend this recording, at its time a novelty in the idea of solistic recordings.&quot;\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
