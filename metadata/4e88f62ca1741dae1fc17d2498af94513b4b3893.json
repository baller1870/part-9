You can read it here on the site.\n\nRosemary and Thyme is a notable recent example of an ITV show featuring a pair of amateur female investigators. Sparrow and Nightingale are a lot younger though. Well, they are until Nightingale blinks at an Angel.\n\nIn our universe, The Hull Times has only been Hull&amp;#039;s Hometown Newspaper since 1930.\n\nMany DVDs, including a large number of the classic Doctor Who releases, have Easter Eggs on them. However, the Doctor&amp;#039;s message to Sally hasn&amp;#039;t featured on any of them. Yet.\n\nOn average, it takes between 300-400 milliseconds to blink. Depending on the circumstances, a human blinks between 3 and 30 times a minute. If confronted by a Weeping Angel, the time endured without blinking can be increased significantly.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! was first broadcast in 1969 - the year that the Doctor, Martha and Billy were transported to by the Weeping Angels.\n\nIn addition to the Weeping Angels, the Doctor has encountered a number of other creatures which are nearly as old as the universe itself. These include the Carrionites (The Shakespeare Code), the Racnoss (The Runaway Bride), and Fenric (The Curse of Fenric). Not one of them has been friendly.\n\nCLASSIC CONNECTIONS:\n\nAlthough the Doctor only appears briefly in Blink, in the early years of the classic series there were episodes where he didn&amp;#039;t appear at all! The Doctor is entirely absent from The Keys of Marinus parts 3 and 4, Mission to the Unknown and The Massacre parts 2 and 3.\n\nFact File compiled by Peter Ware.\n\n[HerMes Digital Media]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e88f62ca1741dae1fc17d2498af94513b4b3893","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+2007+3x10+Blink+%5BHerMes%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e88f62ca1741dae1fc17d2498af94513b4b3893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,136,246,44,161,116,29,174,31,193,125,36,152,175,148,81,59,75,56,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
