Hosted by the world-renowned geneticist and environmentalist, David Suzuki, the program is in its 53rd season, a landmark by any standard.\nEvery week, the influential program presents stories that are driven by a scientific understanding of the world. Stories full of adventure, drama and insight. Our programs entertain and inspire audiences by engaging with the people and personalities behind the science.\nFrom the search for other life in the universe to the psychology of babies, from the furry animals that invade your backyard to the consequences of human progress, The Nature of Things throws open the door to the wonder and accomplishments of science.\n\n\n\n10)  The Great Butterfly Hunt \nThe Great Butterfly Hunt tells the story of incredible journeys. The first is that of the remarkable Monarch migration, which is the longest insect migration on Earth, is. The second story is that of Fred Urquhart, the determined Canadian scientist who spent 40 years trying to discover exactly where the butterflies mysteriously disappeared when they flew south for the winter. The Great Butterfly Hunt is a beautiful and colourful one-hour program that combines the spectacular visuals from Flight of the Butterflies with the production's behind-the-scenes look at how such films get made. On Thursday, January 2, when many Canadians will be groaning about the long grey winter ahead, The Great Butterfly Hunt will remind audiences of the promise of spring. And, at a time when the monarch population is in rapid decline, viewers will have an opportunity to watch one of Nature's most dramatic feats unfold.\n\n11)  Fruit Hunters Part One \nA journey through nature, commerce and adventure, The Fruit Hunters takes us from the dawn of humanity to the cutting of edge of modern agriculture - a series that will change not just the way we look at what we eat, but what it means to be human.\nThe Fruit Hunters' first episode, &quot;The Evolution of Desire,&quot; explores the origins of fruit's diversity and tells the story of humanity and fruit's intimate co-evolution. Every variety of fruit has a story, the story of the person who cultivated an individual plant, and then shared something wonderful with the world. To preserve this diversity is to retain this living memory. A passionate few, the fruit hunters, fight to preserve this diversity in a world increasingly dominated by economically driven monoculture.\n\n12)  Fruit Hunters Part Two \nSupermarkets are stocked with fruit year round in a global permanent summertime, but despite its accessibility, have we lost the diversity that makes it so special? The second episode of The Fruit Hunters will look at what happens when we abandon the Garden of Eden for an industrialized monoculture. In lush jungles of Borneo, Bala Tingang, an elder of one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes, lives of the wild fruits that are the key to his tribe's survival. And yet, all around the world, natural diversity is being replaced with monocultures, plantations of only one variety, bred for long shelf life and transportability rather than their taste or health properties. Not only is this lost of diversity impoverishing our taste buds, but it has catastrophic implications for our food security. In the vast uniform banana fields of Honduras, Juan Aguilar, a banana scientist, frantically tries to breed a banana resistant to a deadly fungus.\n\n13)  Invasion of the Brain Snatchers \nWe like to believe we're in control. But if what we're discovering about parasites is anything to go by, who is really in control is a lot more complicated, and a lot more interesting, than we ever imagined. So let &quot;The Nature of Things with David Suzuki&quot; help you get over the ick factor, and explore the world of parasites. So let &quot;The Nature of Things with David Suzuki&quot; help you get over the ick factor, and explore the world of parasites. Scientists have collected hundreds of examples of parasites that brainwash their hosts. And now researchers are starting to untangle these parasites' evolutionary tricks of the trade. In the coastal estuaries of California, Professor Kevin Lafferty of the United States Geological Survey introduces us to a flatworm that lives in three hosts - a snail, a fish and a bird. This parasite's influence is so profound that it tips the balance of the local ecosystem\n\n14)  Survival of the Fabulous \nAre gay men actually born gay? If so, what causes this and how could homosexuality have survived the evolutionary process?\nEver since openly gay filmmaker Bryce Sage came out of the closet, he has struggled to answer these fundamental questions. Bryce sets out on a cross-country and around the world journey to ferret out the answers. Along the way, he confronts his own homosexuality and family history, exploring the nature vs. nurture side of the issue. He'll bombard his brainwaves with gay and straight erotica to determine just how fundamentally gay his brain really is and he'll talk to animal biologists about their studies of homosexuality in other species. There is documented evidence of homosexuality in over two hundred. Bryce becomes an amateur detective, trying to crack the code of his genes. He discovers that in Samoa every family has a male member who is either gay or is encouraged to become more feminine to support familial needs.\n\n15)  The Pacific Rim Americas \nThis episode focuses on the Asia-Pacific side of The Pacific Rim of Fire, which stands as a living testament to the beauty and danger that powerful geologic forces can deliver. The Pacific Rim is home to half of the world's active volcanoes and ninety percent of the world's earthquakes, yet nearly 800 million people continue to live within its violent edge. Our journey begins in New Zealand, a land of volcanoes and earthquakes, where we find a 500-kilometre long slip-strike fault deep under the Pacific Ocean. Geologist Hamish Campbell will take us to the crater of White Island, the country's most active volcano. Then we'll visit the country's southern island with John Youngson, to find out how New Zealand's longest fault-line contributes to the gold industry. Finally in Japan, viewers will hike up to Mount Fuji - the iconic peak where science and legend converge, getting up-close and personal with a fault-line witnessing firsthand what it's like to discover new ways of monitoring, and hopefully one day predicting, seismic activity onboard the world's most advanced drilling vessels.\n\n16)  The Collision Zone Asia \nWelcome to the Collision Zone - the fiery unpredictability of Indonesia's volcanoes at one end, the massive Himalayas at the other and millions of years of tectonic tension in between. The collision zone of the old world is about to be the hub of the new. India, the Himalayas and the island arc of Indonesia - these lands will form the centre of the world's next supercontinent. A story unfolds-a tale of where the earth has been and what the earth shall be: a whole new world that we'll barely recognize.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/eGYvMXYy.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/eGYvMXYy.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/VzVWS3RF.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/VzVWS3RF.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/S3B1Wlk1.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/S3B1Wlk1.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/M0U5OUgw.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/M0U5OUgw.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/eTZLSWQ0.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/eTZLSWQ0.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/MGVIeTlH.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/MGVIeTlH.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/MW1qOGVj.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/MW1qOGVj.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/REdRNEJ0.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/REdRNEJ0.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/S2VWaC9G.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/S2VWaC9G.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/ZXBYRU02.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/ZXBYRU02.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/N1NyL2xT.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/N1NyL2xT.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/NGtPRlR1.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/NGtPRlR1.jpeg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;034b6a646b434f372d32&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2985 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 6\n * Run-Time: average 50mins\n * Framerate: 29 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 16\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average: 1,003 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Things&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Things&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c53d7c0c8cc3474d74a88e56688731adae47241","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Nature+Of+Things+10of16+The+Great+Butterfly+Hunt+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c53d7c0c8cc3474d74a88e56688731adae47241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,83,215,192,200,204,52,116,215,74,136,229,102,136,115,26,218,228,114,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
