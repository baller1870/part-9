The book begins by applying Lagrange's equations to a number of mechanical systems. It introduces the concepts of generalized coordinates and generalized momentum. Following this the book turns to the calculus of variations to derive the EulerÃ¢â‚¬â€œLagrange equations. It introduces Hamilton's principle and uses this throughout the book to derive further results. The Hamiltonian, Hamilton's equations, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets and HamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â€œJacobi theory are considered next. The book concludes by discussing continuous Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and how they are related to field theory. Written in clear, simple language and featuring numerous worked examples and exercises to help students master the material, this book is a valuable supplement to courses in mechanics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422263163aea6206f872c5ecdcd79c740d3a1554","amp;dn":"A+Student%27s+Guide+to+Lagrangians+and+Hamiltonians+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422263163aea6206f872c5ecdcd79c740d3a1554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,34,99,22,58,234,98,6,248,114,197,236,220,215,156,116,13,58,21,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
