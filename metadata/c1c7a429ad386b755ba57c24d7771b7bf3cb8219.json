Wim Wenders is working on his own film _Hammett (1983)_ in Hollywood, but flies to New York to help Ray realize his final wish. Ray's original intent is to make a fiction film about a dying painter who sails to China to find a cure for his disease. He and Wenders discuss this idea, but it is obviously unrealistic given Ray's state of health.\n\nFile Name .........................................:\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,153,839,104 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:26:22\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x416 (AR: 1.731)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1582 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.211 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n \n\nThanks chelsea girl for the rip.\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
