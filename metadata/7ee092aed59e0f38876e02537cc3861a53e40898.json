You need a plan to guide your business, both now and in the future, to define the long-term strategy youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll use to help you achieve your goals and mission. You need a plan to share with your employees, to show them where you want to go and how you want to get there, to motivate them and direct their day-to-day activities. You need a plan to provide to potential lenders and investors, to convince them that your business is a good risk with strong potential, and to encourage them to provide the funding you need to grow and nurture your business. The problem is how do you create an effective business plan? YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a businessperson, not a writer; you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even know what you need to know to pull the right information together and put your thoughts and strategies on paper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee092aed59e0f38876e02537cc3861a53e40898","amp;dn":"Alpha+Books-Teach+Yourself+Business+Plans+in+24+Hours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee092aed59e0f38876e02537cc3861a53e40898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,224,146,174,213,158,15,56,135,110,2,83,124,195,134,26,83,228,8,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
