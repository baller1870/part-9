For the longest time I thought there were no 720p sources, but I finally found one. In fact, I had already ripped this in 480p when I finally stumbled across this HD source and re-did the entire thing in 720p. This was one of the best movies of the entire decade. Includes Sam Shepard, Scott Glen and Ed Harris just to name a few. Also included are three extras from the 2-disc special edition DVD (though not in 720p): Realizing the Right Stuff, T Minus 20 Years and Counting, and The Real Men with The Right Stuff. I'm quite proud of this particular torrent since, as of right now, this will be the only version in 720p resolution on several sites and the only version to have any extras from the special edition DVD. Spanish and Dutch subtitles are included in a separate folder. English subs in the main folder as always. The extras were encoded in their native resolutions and DAR's @ 800kbps, are a total of 326megs between three files, and total 48m06s of extras footage.\n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\n(My 1080p encodes will still look crisp and sharp on monitors up to 28-30&quot;, and possibly larger. The above paragraph primarily applies to 720p and below.)\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d89efb882412bfa4af1ac26452c9169bae1d46","amp;dn":"The+Right+Stuff+%281983%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d89efb882412bfa4af1ac26452c9169bae1d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,216,158,251,136,36,18,191,164,175,26,194,100,82,201,22,155,174,29,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
