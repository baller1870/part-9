The San Francisco-based act, made up of Eric\nand beatmeister Gio, seem set on proving that the groove is not only in the feet\nbut in the heart as well.\n\nThe duo's debut Get Sharp, a follow-up to last year's Scrapbook EP, combines\nupbeat, electronic wizardry with often introspective lyrics. &quot;The Future,&quot; is\nperhaps the catchiest tune about nihilism ever recorded. &quot;And we die our empty\nbodies turn to dust,&quot; Eric sings. &quot;There's nothing we can do that matters/But\nthat's okay.&quot; Angels, demons, heaven and hell are all dismissed in the name of\nliving for the moment, however temporary. Standout track &quot;Very Busy People,&quot;\noffers a sardonic take on modern society's unproductive productiveness. &quot;We'll\nstay up late making mixtapes/Photoshopping pictures of ourselves/While we\nmasturbate to these pixelated videos/Of strangers fucking themselves,&quot; Eric\nsings in a matter-of-fact voice, seemingly implicating himself and the rest of\nus for our everyday acts of self-indulgence.\n\nThe title track's lyrics mockingly recite the trappings of conventional middle\nclass life, from chasing a paystub to getting the 9 to 5 cubicle-ready haircut.\n&quot;Maybe it's my slacker lack of motivation or whatever&quot; Erics sings with more\nswagger in his voice over bits and samples that sound straight out of 80's video\ngame Duck Hunt. Musically the album is all drum loops, synths, thumping bass and\nsamples, and seldom veers off into unfamiliar territory, with the exception of\ntribal beats that end &quot;Wildfire&quot; and the distorted vocal tripping of &quot;Wishing\nWell.&quot; While the music backdrop is rarely dull, more sonic experimentation could\nhave made for a more explosive overall sound.\n\nThe albums last songs ends with The Shirelles'-borrowed lines &quot;Mama said there'd\nbe days like this.&quot; While what Eric is refering to is unclear, hopefully the\nduo's next release will provide further clues. Their debut certainly has given\nplenty of food for thought.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284b547d69f6f3f99a99a859f132c3f0e374b300","amp;dn":"The+Limousines-Get+Sharp-2011-RTB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284b547d69f6f3f99a99a859f132c3f0e374b300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,75,84,125,105,246,243,249,154,153,168,89,241,50,195,240,227,116,179,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
