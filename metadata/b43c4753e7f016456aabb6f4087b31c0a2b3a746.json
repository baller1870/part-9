Companies that sell products and services on the web face unique challenges that impact their search rankings. For example, when products expire, share identifying information, or lack metadata, it can hurt your search ranking and drive down traffic to your store. That's why you need site optimization strategies and techniques specifically tailored for ecommerce. In this course, Steve Harris walks through researching your audience and competitors, setting up your site structure for success, and using SEO best practices to improve your content. He also introduces on-page optimization strategies, such as implementing breadcrumbs and product reviews and using tracking tools to measure your performance.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tHow SEO affects the buying process\r\n\tâ€¢\tResearching customers, keywords, and competitors\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing simple and long tail keywords\r\n\tâ€¢\tEliminating duplicate site content\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing rich media\r\n\tâ€¢\tDesigning landing pages to drive engagement\r\n\tâ€¢\tBlogging for SEO\r\n\tâ€¢\tA/B testing with Optimizely\r\n\tâ€¢\tMeasuring traffic with Google Analytics\r\n \r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43c4753e7f016456aabb6f4087b31c0a2b3a746","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+SEO+for+Ecommerce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43c4753e7f016456aabb6f4087b31c0a2b3a746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,60,71,83,231,240,22,69,106,171,182,244,8,123,49,192,162,179,167,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
