Madou (CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nDesigned for science and engineering students, this text focuses on emerging trends in processes for fabricating MEMS and NEMS devices. The book reviews different forms of lithography, subtractive material removal processes, and additive technologies. Both top-down and bottom-up fabrication processes are exhaustively covered and the merits of the different approaches are compared. Students can use this color volume as a guide to help establish the appropriate fabrication technique for any type of micro- or nano-machine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16ef06b2e0a3289bd0370d7d1f4b9916d8ece16","amp;dn":"Manufacturing+Techniques+for+Microfabrication+and+Nanotechnology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16ef06b2e0a3289bd0370d7d1f4b9916d8ece16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,110,240,107,46,10,50,137,189,3,112,215,209,244,185,145,109,142,206,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
