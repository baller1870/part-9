In 1978, seven years after lead singer Jim Morrison died and five years after the remaining members of the band broke up, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore reunited and recorded backing tracks over Morrison's poetry (originally recorded in 1969 and 1970). Other pieces of music and spoken word recorded by the Doors and Morrison were also used in the audio collage, such as dialogue from Morrison's film HWY and snippets from jam sessions. The album received mixed reviews and still divides critics, yet it has managed a platinum certification in the US. When the album was originally released, longtime Doors' producer Paul Rothchild labeled the album a &quot;rape of Jim Morrison&quot;. Rothchild claimed that he had heard all of the reels of master tapes from both the 1969 and the 1970 poetry sessions, insisting that the three remaining Doors failed to realize Morrison's original intent for an audio presentation of the poetry. Morrison himself, prior to leaving for Paris, had approached composer Lalo Schifrin as a possible contributor for the music tracks meant to accompany the poetry, with no participation from any of the other Doors members. In addition, he had developed some conception of the album cover art work by January 1971, and was in correspondence with artist T. E. Breitenbach to design this cover in the form of a tryptich (a three-paneled painting with various images embedded in each panel).\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide one:\n&quot;Awake&quot;\n&quot;Ghost Song&quot;\n&quot;Dawn's Highway / Newborn Awakening&quot;\n&quot;To Come of Age&quot;\n&quot;Black Polished Chrome / Latino Chrome&quot;\n&quot;Angels and Sailors / Stoned Immaculate&quot;\n&quot;The Movie&quot;\n&quot;Curses, Invocations&quot;\n\nSide two:\n&quot;American Night&quot;\n&quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;\n&quot;Lament&quot;\n&quot;The Hitchhiker\n&quot;An American Prayer&quot;\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Rock\nStyles: Psychedelic rock, spoken word, poetry, funk rock\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate : ~ 4 797-4 965 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362433470062e2a0c80415b1717f87bd87f5644b","amp;dn":"%281978%29+Jim+Morrison%2C+Music+by+The+Doors+-+An+American+Prayer+%5BVi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362433470062e2a0c80415b1717f87bd87f5644b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,36,51,71,0,98,226,160,200,4,21,177,113,127,135,189,135,245,100,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
