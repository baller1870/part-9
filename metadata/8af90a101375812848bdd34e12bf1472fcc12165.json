The film was a biography of English bank robber John McVicar, was produced by Daltrey and also featured him in the starring role. Because all members of The Who played on the album, it is often considered to be an unrecognized Who album.\n\nThe album was released in June, 1980, on Polydor PD-1-6284 in the USA. It was produced by Jeff Wayne and recorded at Advison Studios, London. Daltrey's vocals were recorded at Air Studios, Montserrat, West Indies. The album reached #22 in the U.S. charts and produced Daltrey's highest charting single, &quot;Without Your Love.&quot;\n\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. &quot;Bitter and Twisted&quot; (Steve Swindells) \n02. &quot;Just a Dream Away&quot; (Russ Ballard)\n03. &quot;Escape Pt.1&quot; \n04. &quot;White City Lights&quot; (Billy Nicholls &amp; Jon Lind) \n05. &quot;Free Me&quot; (Russ Ballard) \n06. &quot;My Time Is Gonna Come&quot; (Russ Ballard) \n07. &quot;Waiting for a Friend&quot; (Billy Nicholls) \n08. &quot;Escape Pt.2&quot; \n09. &quot;Without Your Love&quot; (Billy Nicholls) \n10. &quot;McVicar&quot; (Billy Nicholls) \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoger Harry Daltrey CBE (born 1 March 1944) is an English rock vocalist, songwriter, and actor, best known as the founder and lead singer of English rock band The Who. He has maintained a musical career as a solo artist and has also worked in the film industry, acting in a large number of film, theatre and television roles and also producing films.\n\nEarly years:\n\nRoger Harry Daltrey was born in the Hammersmith area of London, but was raised in Acton, the same working class suburban neighbourhood that produced fellow Who members Pete Townshend and John Entwistle. He was one of three children born to parents Irene and Harry Daltrey, and grew up with two sisters, Gillian and Carol. Harry Daltrey worked for a water closet manufacturer, and Irene Daltrey was told she would be unable to have children because of losing a kidney in 1937. Nevertheless, she went into labour during a World War II air raid and gave birth to her son at the nearby Hammersmith Hospital, West London. At the age of three, the young Roger swallowed a rusty nail which had to be surgically removed, leaving a visible scar. At the age of five, the rust from the nail caused an ulcer in his stomach which required him to be hospitalised.\n\nDaltrey attended Victoria Primary School and then Acton County Grammar School for boys along with Pete Townshend and John Entwistle. He showed academic promise in the English state school system, ranking at the top of his class on the eleven plus examination that led to his enrollment at the Acton County Grammar School. His parents hoped he would eventually continue on to study at university, but Daltrey turned out to be a self-described &quot;school rebel&quot; and developed a dedicated interest in the emerging rock and roll music scene instead.\n\nHe made his first guitar from a block of wood and formed a skiffle band called The Detours. When his father bought him an Epiphone guitar in 1959, he became the lead guitarist for the band and soon afterward was expelled from school for smoking. Describing the post-war times, Pete Townshend wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Until he was expelled, Roger had been a good pupil. Then he heard Elvis and transmogrified into a Teddy Boy with an electric guitar and a dress-sneer. Was it simply rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll? It was obvious to a young man as intelligent as Roger that there was no future in conforming any more.&quot;\n\nDaltrey became a sheet metal worker during the day, while practicing and performing nights with the band at weddings, pubs and men's clubs. He invited schoolmate John Entwistle to play bass in the band, and on the advice of Entwistle, invited Pete Townshend to play guitar. At that time, the band consisted of Daltrey on lead guitar, Pete Townshend on rhythm guitar, John Entwistle on bass, Doug Sandom on Drums and Colin Dawson on lead vocals. After Colin Dawson left the band, Daltrey switched to vocals and played harmonica as well, while Townshend became the lead guitarist. In 1964 drummer Doug Sandom left the band, and Keith Moon became the drummer. Lately, Daltrey has played acoustic guitar on some songs during concerts.\n\nEarly on, Daltrey was the band's leader, earning a reputation for using his fists to exercise control when needed, despite his small stature (his height is reportedly 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m). According to Townshend, Roger &quot;ran things the way he wanted. If you argued with him, you usually got a bunch of fives.&quot; He generally selected the music they performed, including songs by The Beatles, various Motown artists, James Brown, and other rock standards.\n\nIn 1964 the group discovered another band working as The Detours and discussed changing their name. Pete Townshend suggested &quot;The Hair&quot; and Townshend's roommate Richard Barnes suggested &quot;The Who.&quot; The next morning, Daltrey made the decision for the band, saying &quot;It's The Who, innit?&quot;\n\nDuring 1964, band manager Peter Meaden renamed the band The High Numbers as part of a move to establish the band as Mod favourites. The name was a reference to the T-shirts with &quot;numbers&quot; that the Mods used at the time. Pete Meaden composed Mod songs for them (in fact, the songs were almost copies of Mod hits at the time, with changed lyrics) and they released just one single, &quot;I'm The Face/Zoot Suit&quot;, by Fontana Records. After this single was unsuccessful, the band changed their name back to The Who.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af90a101375812848bdd34e12bf1472fcc12165","amp;dn":"Roger+Daltrey+-+%5C%27McVicar%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af90a101375812848bdd34e12bf1472fcc12165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,249,10,16,19,117,129,40,72,189,211,78,18,191,20,114,252,193,33,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
