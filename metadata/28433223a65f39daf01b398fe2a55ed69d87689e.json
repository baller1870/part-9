When teenager Ren and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small town in the West, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. There is one small pleasure, however: Ariel, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. and a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and &quot;Let's Hear It for the Boy.&quot; \nDirector: Herbert Ross\nStars:         Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer and John Lithgow\nimdb:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/&lt;/a&gt;   \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/442/vlcsnap2011120115h19m27.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/442/vlcsnap2011120115h19m27.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/638/vlcsnap2011120115h20m02.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/638/vlcsnap2011120115h20m02.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/vlcsnap2011120115h20m44.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/vlcsnap2011120115h20m44.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/21/vlcsnap2011120115h21m25.png/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/21/vlcsnap2011120115h21m25.png/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         VISIT MY BLOG   or           for fb page links\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28433223a65f39daf01b398fe2a55ed69d87689e","amp;dn":"Footloose+%281984%29+720p_BRrip_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28433223a65f39daf01b398fe2a55ed69d87689e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,67,50,35,166,95,57,218,240,27,57,143,226,165,94,214,157,135,104,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
