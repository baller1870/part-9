There's no passing up a serious job right now, and no time to be choosy about clientele. In fact, his new client isn't giving him a choice, and there's a chance he knows something the Killer wants: the answer to what went wrong in Paris. The stakes are rising, but the Killer's ready to play the game: keeping his head and putting holes in everyone else's.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a155d129e063ee0a0ce49da23fed6264d39485","amp;dn":"The+Killer+Vol.+2+-+The+Debt+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a155d129e063ee0a0ce49da23fed6264d39485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,161,85,209,41,224,99,238,10,12,228,157,162,63,237,98,100,211,148,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
