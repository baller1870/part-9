Not everyone supports his ideals, however, and having offended the pope by welcoming Jews and heretics into England, David is summoned to Canterbury to explain himself.\n\nBut when information comes to light that reveals the accusations against him have less to do with religion than with power and wealth, David finds himself on familiar groundÃ¢â‚¬â€and at the center of a conspiracy that stretches from Ireland to Italy. Facing excommunication, a fickle populace, and a rebellion even by his fellow time travelers, he must decide what his throne is worth, and what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to sacrifice to keep it.\n\n\nProduct Details:\nPublisher: The Morgan-Stanwood Publishing Group\nFile size: epub 274 Kb mobi 374 Kb\nLanguage: English\n\n\nWarden of Time is the eighth novel in the After Cilmeri series.\n\nDaughter of Time (prequel)\nFootsteps in Time (Book 1)\nWinds of Time (novella)\nPrince of Time (Book 2)\nCrossroads in Time (Book 3)\nChildren of Time (Book 4)\nExiles in Time (Book 5)\nCastaways in Time (Book 6)\nAshes of Time (Book 7)\nWarden of Time (Book 8)\n\nNote: The rest of the series can be found in the highlander romance time travel No. 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db7bfd700e6e1ababa7c1fad7f38a4cb11fc05d","amp;dn":"Warden+of+Time+ebook+by+Sarah+Woodbury+After+Cilmeri+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db7bfd700e6e1ababa7c1fad7f38a4cb11fc05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,183,191,215,0,230,225,171,171,167,193,250,215,243,138,76,177,31,192,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
