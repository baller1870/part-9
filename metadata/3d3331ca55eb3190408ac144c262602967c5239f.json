The album was recorded at Escape Studios, Kent, with additional recording and mixing at AIR Studios, London, and is the band's biggest selling album, having sold two million copies worldwide.[citation needed]\n\nAfter three albums with Deep Purple's Roger Glover producing, Manny Charlton stepped into that position, one he filled for several subsequent albums.\n\nIt was Nazareth's first big hit album (aside from the minor success of Razamanaz), including classics such as the title track, &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (on the US version, but not the Canadian/European, it replaced the original &quot;Guilty&quot;), &quot;Beggars Day&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Judas Me&quot;.\n\nThe album title is often considered to be a shortened form of the phrase describing a folk hangover cure, &quot;the hair of the dog that bit you&quot;. However, according to Dan McCafferty, the title is a play on &quot;heir of the dog&quot;, i.e. a &quot;son of a bitch&quot;. This was the title the band had intended for the album, but the label did not approve and had the name changed.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n    Hair Of The Dog\n    Miss Misery\n    Love Hurts\n    Changin' Times\n    Beggars Day - Rose In Heather\n    Whisky Drinkin' Woman\n    Please Don't Judas Me\n    Guilty\n\n\nBand members\n\n    Dan McCafferty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, talk box on &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;\n    Manny Charlton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, synthesizer\n    Pete Agnew Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, backing vocals\n    Darrell Sweet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, backing vocals\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Max Middleton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano on &quot;Guilty&quot;\n    Simon Phillips - tabla on &quot;Please Don't Judas Me&quot;\n    Vicki Brown, Liza Strike, Barry St. John Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals on &quot;Guilty&quot;\n    Vicky Silva Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals on &quot;Please Don't Judas Me&quot;\n\n\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3331ca55eb3190408ac144c262602967c5239f","amp;dn":"Nazareth+-+Hair+Of+The+Dog+%28+Remasterd+Edition+2011%29a4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3331ca55eb3190408ac144c262602967c5239f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,51,49,202,85,235,49,144,64,138,193,68,194,98,96,41,103,197,35,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
