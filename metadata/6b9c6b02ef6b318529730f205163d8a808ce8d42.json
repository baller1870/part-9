Every year, readers, sportswriters, and critics alike look forward to these collections. In 2014, Booklist observed, â€œThis annual series detailing the year in boxing should be a highlight, not only for fans of the sport but also for those who appreciate journalistic acumen and stylish prose.â€\r\n\r\nOther sportswriters have called Hauser â€œthe dean of fightwritersâ€ (TheSweetScience.com) and â€œour craftâ€™s most celebrated practitionerâ€ (15Rounds.com).
