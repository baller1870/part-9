It is produced by Frederator Studios, for the cable network Nickelodeon, where it is currently one of the most popular shows (second only to SpongeBob SquarePants). The television series is also distributed outside the United States by the Canadian animation company Nelvana, the same as Danny Phantom (also created by Hartman). The show makes heavy use of satire and slapstick, and is full of pop culture references. The show is currently airing its sixth season.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14aba3cae1fe69d71cbdacc1239aab3a36258aa","amp;dn":"The.Fairly.OddParents.5.Seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14aba3cae1fe69d71cbdacc1239aab3a36258aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,74,186,60,174,31,230,157,113,203,218,204,18,57,170,179,163,98,88,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
