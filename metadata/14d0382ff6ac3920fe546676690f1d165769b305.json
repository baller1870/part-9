Within a couple of months they had teamed up with Jon Watson (bass) and Pablo Labritain (drums) and 999 were officially born. It was with this line up that all the tracks on this CD were recorded. Their first gig was at the Northampton Cricket Club in January 1977. Interest in the band was immediate and constant gigging around London brought with it critical acclaim and a hard core following of supporters from Southall, calling themselves 'The Crew'. These ranks were soon swollen by the Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Munich! Vienna, Zagreb, Stockholm, Oslo, Berlin, New York, LA, Toronto, Philadelphia, and San Francisco 'Crews' each proving as dedicated as the last.\n\nThe frenzy and raw energy of the early days were captured by their debut single 'I'm Alive' on the bands own Labritain label and sold well enough to become a minor hit. Next through their association with United Artists records the second and third singles, 'Nasty Nasty' and the now classic 'Emergency' were released both scaling the lower reaches of the charts and confirming 999 to be one of the major forces in the British New Wave movement. The first album titled simply '999' was released and was greeted with impressive sales and critical acclaim. Extensive touring took them throughout Britain and Europe where they now encountered full houses.\n\nThe second album 'Separates' was released and immediately the single 'Homicide' leapt straight into the UK top forty, without any radio airplay, but was banned because of the title and lyrical content.\n\nEarly 1979 saw the band embarking on their first US tour which was an achievement in itself, as they were still without a record deal in America at the time. Response to the band was ecstatic, all the venues being filled and import albums being sold out in a rush of enthusiasm. The band were immediately booked for a return trip.\n\nSince leaving United Artists, 999 have recorded another nine albums. Jon Watson was replaced in 1986 on bass by Danny Palmer and to date the band have completed 13 US tours, 72 London gigs, 15 UK tours and 13 European tours, visiting Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Belgium, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Yugoslavia. 999 will see the band touring England, Europe and hopefully for the first time Japan.\n\nMost of the singles and many of the tracks here are still used by 999 in their current stage performance. Also included here are two extra tracks 'Action' and 'Waiting', available before only as a very limited 12'' single given away with the first copies of the 'Separates' album.\n\n                                                                                                                                    - NICK CASH\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D7SRqkV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D7SRqkV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
