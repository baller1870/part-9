Directed by Yves Simoneau. Starring Molly Parker, John C. McGinley and Piper Laurie.\n\nSource: TV so quality isn't great, but it's decent and I don't think this was ever released on video or dvd. Pretty intense at times with fine acting, in particular by John C. McGinley. I haven't read the book so I can't vouch for how close this is to the Dean Koontz's original story.
