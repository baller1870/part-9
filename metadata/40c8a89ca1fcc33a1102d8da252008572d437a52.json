Be it a kid looking for success in the music business or any life-challenging endeavor that someone would 'run away' from in life, I'm certain that everyone can relate to this story one way or another. It's another kid 'chasing the dream' and trying to survive it in the process. We've all been there.&quot;\n\n&quot;Golgotha&quot; track listing:\n\n\n01. Scream\n\n       02. Last Runaway\n\n03.
