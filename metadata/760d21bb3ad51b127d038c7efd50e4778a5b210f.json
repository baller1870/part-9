Prototypes help you to flesh out design ideas, test assumptions, and gather real-time feedback from users. With this book, Todd Zaki Warfel shows how prototypes are more than just a design tool by demonstrating how they can help you market a product, gain internal buy-in, and test feasibility with your development team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:760d21bb3ad51b127d038c7efd50e4778a5b210f","amp;dn":"Prototyping%3A+A+Practitioner%27s+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"760d21bb3ad51b127d038c7efd50e4778a5b210f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,13,33,187,58,213,27,18,125,3,140,126,253,80,228,119,138,91,33,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
