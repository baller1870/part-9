Ã¢â‚¬Å“Network Signal Info ProÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides detailed \n\ninformation on your currently used network, regardless whether you are using WiFi or \n\na cellular connection. \n\nRequirements: Android Device OS 2.1 and above \n\n\nThe Pro version (compared to the free version) has no ads, more widgets, a &quot;mobile-\n\nsignal-lost-service&quot; (beta) and a in the background running log function. \n\nNow with widgets: 1x1, 2x1 and 2x2 in 3 different styles. \n\n(If you can't find widgets, please copy the app to phone memory) \n\nI have especially worked on the visualization of the WiFi and mobile signal \n\nstrength. They have received special importance. Normally they are only divided \n\ninto weak, good and excellent signals. Graphically there are mostly &quot;only&quot; three to \n\nfive bars shown as a mobile signal and three &quot;waves&quot; shown as a WiFi connection. \n\nMy app differentiates the signal strength into a total of 14 bars. This will give \n\nyou a quick visualized and detailed information on your signal strength. \n\nIn addition to the more sophisticated graphical representation of the signal \n\nstrength you will also be able to see some more interesting information. \n\nFurthermore, there is a log function in csv-file format for wireless and mobile \n\nsignal strength available (for e.g. Excel import). \n\nWith &quot;Mobile Signal&quot;: \n\n\nNetwork operators, sim provider, phone type, network type, network strength in dbm \n\nand ASU, data state, data activity, country code of the mobile phone, device ID, IP \n\naddress (internal und external), roaming state. \n\nIn &quot;WiFi signal&quot;: \n\n\nWiFi-Name (SSID), BSSID, MAC address, maximum WiFi speed, IP address, external IP \n\naddress, net capability, net channel, subnet mask, Gateway IP address, DHCP server \n\naddress, DNS1 and DNS2 address.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c6a791a7568427c78742c31d364a377b1b1cd3","amp;dn":"Network.Signal.Info.Pro.1.80.2.Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c6a791a7568427c78742c31d364a377b1b1cd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,198,167,145,167,86,132,39,199,135,66,195,29,54,74,55,123,27,28,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
