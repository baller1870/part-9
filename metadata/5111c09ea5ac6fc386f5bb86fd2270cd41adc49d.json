It was released on August 6, 1976. The album was recorded around the same time as Parliament's Mothership Connection and Funkadelic's Let's Take It To The Stage at United Sound Systems in Detroit, Michigan. The album was produced by Collins and George Clinton. Collins co-wrote all of the album's seven songs (two with Clinton, one with vocalist Leslyn Bailey and four with Clinton and other band members) and did the arrangements (horn arrangements in collaboration with Fred Wesley). Since its original release, Stretchin' Out in Bootsy's Rubber Band has been reissued and remastered several times.\n\n01 Stretchin' Out (In a Rubber Band) William Collins, George Clinton\t6:53\n02 Psychoticbumpschool W.
