It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach #5 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two singles &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.\nThe title of the album was taken from an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, &quot;it's got them Disraeli Gears&quot;, meaning to say &quot;derailleur gears,&quot; but instead alluding to 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick's turn of phrase, the album would simply have been entitled &quot;Cream.&quot;\n\nThe original 11-track album was remastered in 1998, and then subsequently released as a two-disc Deluxe Edition in 2004.\n\nIn 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time in 2001.\n\nThe &quot;Disraeli Gears Deluxe Edition&quot; includes the complete album in both mono and stereo, demos, alternate takes and tracks taken from the band's live sessions on BBC radio. Included an outtake of &quot;Blue Condition&quot; with Eric Clapton on lead vocals and demos of the songs &quot;Weird of Hermiston&quot; and &quot;The Clearout&quot; which were not released until Jack Bruce's first solo album &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCd1 (Stereo)\nOriginal album - Tracks 1-11\n\n1.Strange Brew (Eric Clapton, Felix Pappalardi, Gail Collins Pappalardi)\n2.Sunshine of Your Love (Clapton, Jack Bruce, Pete Brown) \n3.World of Pain (Pappalardi, Gail Collins) \n4.Dance the Night Away (Bruce, Brown)\n5.Blue Condition (Ginger Baker)\n6.Tales of Brave Ulysses (Clapton, Martin Sharp) \n7.Swlabr (Bruce, Brown) \n8.We're Going Wrong&quot; (Bruce) \n9.Outside Woman Blues&quot; (Blind Joe Reynolds,Clapton) \n10.Take It Back&quot; (Bruce, Brown) \n11.Mother's Lament&quot; (Tradicional, arreglos: Clapton, Bruce, Baker)\n\nOut-takes\n12.Lawdy Mama - version 1 (Traditional, arr.
