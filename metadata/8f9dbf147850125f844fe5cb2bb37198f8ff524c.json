With not one but two songs dubbed &quot;Heavy Metal,&quot; it&amp;#039;s pretty obvious where A Catholic Education is coming from; the title track (also here in duplicate) is a surprisingly snarky attack on the church (at least for a band not exactly renowned for its political agenda), while the great &quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s Fool&quot; is a merciless scenester put-down without any of the gentle sarcasm that characterizes similarly themed efforts like Bandwagonesque&amp;#039;s &quot;Metal Baby.&quot; Regardless, for all its glaring differences in attitude and approach, there&amp;#039;s no mistaking the effortless melodicism that remains the hallmark of all Teenage Fanclub records -- in particular, the opening &quot;Everything Flows,&quot; for all its meandering abrasiveness, is still as good as anything the band ever recorded, and that&amp;#039;s saying something.\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (McGinley)\n   2. &quot;Everything Flows&quot; (Blake)\n   3. &quot;Catholic Education&quot; (Blake)\n   4. &quot;Too Involved&quot; (Blake/McGinley)\n   5. &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Need a Drum&quot; (Blake/McGinley)\n   6. &quot;Critical Mass&quot; (Blake)\n   7. &quot;Heavy Metal II&quot; (Blake/McGinley)\n   8. &quot;Catholic Education II&quot; (Blake)\n   9. &quot;Eternal Light&quot; (Blake)\n  10. &quot;Every Picture I Paint&quot; (Blake/McGinley)\n  11. &quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s Fool&quot; (Blake/Love/McGinley) ?\n\nEnjoy!\n/T.DUck!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9dbf147850125f844fe5cb2bb37198f8ff524c","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+Teenage+Fanclub+-+A+Catholic+Education+%5B1990%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9dbf147850125f844fe5cb2bb37198f8ff524c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,157,191,20,120,80,18,95,132,79,229,203,43,179,113,152,248,255,82,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
