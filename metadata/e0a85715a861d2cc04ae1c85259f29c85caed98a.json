The music very much has the feel of a jam session and, other than a themeless blues, all of the songs are veteran standards.  Highlights of this fine effort include &quot;I Can't Give You Anything but Love,&quot; &quot;The Gypsy,&quot; &quot;Scrapple from the Apple,&quot; &quot;Easy Does It&quot; and &quot;I Remember You.&quot;  Lots of cooking music. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nSonny Stitt (Alto and Tenor Saxophone) \nOscar Peterson (Piano) \nRay Brown (Double Bass) \nEd Thigpen (Drums ) - 1-8 \nHerb Ellis (Guitar) - 9-11 \nStan Levey (Drums) - 9-11 \n\nSonny Stitt  - Sits in With Oscar Peterson Trio Tracks:\n01   I Can't Give You Anything But Love (Dorothy Fields/Jimmy McHugh) 4:04 \n02   Au Privave (Charlie Parker) 4:00 \n03   The Gypsy (Billy Reid) 3:27 \n04   I'll Remember April (Don Raye/Gene DePaul/Patricia Johnston) 4:43 \n05   Scrapple from the Apple (Charlie Parker) 4:21 \n06   Moten Swing (Bennie Moten) 7:09 \n07   Blues for Pres, Sweets, Ben &amp; All the Other Funky Ones (Sonny Stitt) 6:05 \n08   Easy Does It (Trummy Young/Sy Oliver) 5:24 \n09   I Didn't Know What Time It Was (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) 3:27 \n10   I Remember You (Johnny Mercer/Victor Schertzinger) 3:46 \n11   I Know That You Know (Annie Caldwell/Vincent Youmans) 4:40 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a85715a861d2cc04ae1c85259f29c85caed98a","amp;dn":"Sonny+Stitt++-+Sits+in+With+Oscar+Peterson+Trio+%281957%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a85715a861d2cc04ae1c85259f29c85caed98a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,168,87,21,168,97,210,204,4,174,28,133,37,159,41,200,92,174,217,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
