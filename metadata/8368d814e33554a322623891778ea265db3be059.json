In The Universe Within, with his trademark clarity and exuberance, Shubin takes an even more expansive approach to the question of why we look the way we do. Starting once again with fossils, he turns his gaze skyward, showing us how the entirety of the universeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourteen-billion-year history can be seen in our bodies. As he moves from our very molecular composition (a result of stellar events at the origin of our solar system) through the workings of our eyes, Shubin makes clear how the evolution of the cosmos has profoundly marked our own bodies.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8368d814e33554a322623891778ea265db3be059","amp;dn":"%5BNEW%5D+The+Universe+Within+-+History+of+Rocks%2C+Planets%2C+and+Peopl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8368d814e33554a322623891778ea265db3be059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,104,216,20,227,53,84,163,34,98,56,145,119,142,162,101,219,59,224,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
