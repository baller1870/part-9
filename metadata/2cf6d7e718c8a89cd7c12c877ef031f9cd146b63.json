Daniel Victor performs all musical instruments, with most of his songs featuring guest singers. The idea behind Neverending White Lights is to present a sampling of different voices, styles, and artists, while retaining the 'focused' sound characteristic of a band.\n\n\n\n\n\nAct I: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies 2005\n\n\nAct 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies is a 2005 multi-artist collaborative album by Neverending White Lights. Conceived by Daniel Victor, it features lead vocal performances by members of different bands, including several well known Canadian acts, such as Our Lady Peace, Finger Eleven, Alexisonfire, The Watchmen, Creeper Lagoon, and Age of Electric.\n\nSonically, the album mixes diverse ambient textures and symphonics with drum loops and melancholic vocal melodies creating a style of ambient indie-pop/rock much different and more experimental than other acts in the same class. It was Victor's debut album as a writer, producer and performer. The album as a whole took 4 years to realize from start to finish and proved very trying to finish.\n\nThe first single off the album, &quot;The Grace&quot;, features Dallas Green, and was originally entitled &quot;Grace of a Happy Death&quot;.[citation needed] The single was a big hit in Canada (hitting # 1 on the video charts and # 3 on the radio charts) and brought the project into the mainstream almost over night. Two more singles were released afterward (&quot;Angels &amp; Saints&quot; and &quot;Age of Consent&quot;). A series of connecting videos were coincided with the singles (known as the NWL video trilogy) where Victor played a dream-like Victorian character searching for an angel love interest (played by Canadian singer-songwriter Emm Gryner).\n\nTracks that were to appear on Act I include another track sung by Daniel Victor entitled &quot;Head Down&quot;, &quot;Throwing Chairs&quot; featuring Jonathan Foreman of Switchfoot, &quot;John Dies at 56&quot; featuring Mogwai, &quot;Shipbuilding&quot;, an Elvis Costello cover featuring Andy Yorke, and &quot;This Is My Fate&quot;, another track featuring Dallas Green. They were all cut for various reasons.\n\nThe album led Victor to many award nominations and wins, including &quot;Favourite Single of the Year&quot; (Indie Awards) and &quot;Favourite Group of the Year&quot; (Radio Music Awards) in 2007. It also gave Victor his first Juno nomination for &quot;New Artist of the Year&quot; (at the 2007 Juno Awards).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\nI: The Hour Arrives\n\n1. &quot;From What I Once Was&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55\n2. &quot;Angels &amp; Saints&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n3. &quot;Age of Consent&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n4. &quot;Ending of a Story&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n5. &quot;Return Our Lives&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:00\n\n\n\nII: My Angel, My Queen, My Death, My Treasure\n\n6. &quot;I Hope Your Heart Runs Empty&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23\n7. &quot;A Littlepiece&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n8. &quot;This Longing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:43\n9. &quot;Of All the Things You've Done Wrong&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n10. &quot;Tired of Saving Souls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20\n11. &quot;How Could I Survive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n12. &quot;The Grace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19\n\n\n\nIII: A Pale Nation Sleeps in Misery\n\n13. &quot;First Days of Spring&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n14. &quot;Liar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n15. &quot;Life Is a Dead Scene&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n16. &quot;Our Final Hymn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf6d7e718c8a89cd7c12c877ef031f9cd146b63","amp;dn":"Neverending+White+Lights+-+Act+I%3A+2005+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf6d7e718c8a89cd7c12c877ef031f9cd146b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,246,215,231,24,200,168,156,215,193,44,135,126,240,49,249,205,20,107,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
