They later formed Sublime with Brad Nowell. The Long Beach Dub Allstars (LBDAS for short) were founded after Brad died in 1996 of a heroin overdose.\n\nThe band released their debut recording called Right Back, issued in 1999 and their second album was Wonders of the World in 2001.\n\nIn 2002 rumors that the band had broken up began to surface. Apparently the band had taken a hard-drug-free vow and some of the band's members had broken this vow, which caused Bud Gaugh to quit. On January 14, 2003 Gaugh was arrested for the possession of marijuana.\n\nEric Wilson and RAS-1 formed Long Beach Shortbus along with two new members. Bud Gaugh and Opie Ortiz formed Dubcat. Shortbus has had slightly more success than Dubcat, but neither band has sold nearly as well as LBDAS.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:553ebb54b3b7583838796b474807dc1848d38edc","amp;dn":"Long+Beach+Dub+Allstars+-+Wonders+of+The+World%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"553ebb54b3b7583838796b474807dc1848d38edc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,62,187,84,179,183,88,56,56,121,107,71,72,7,220,24,72,211,142,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
