I am happy to be able to share the materials that follow, such as they are, in the hope that they may be of some use and benefit to others.\n\n The simple teaching device I used was three-fold: 1. Make a note of an idiom/expression\n 2. Define and explain it in understandable words (including synonyms.)\n 3. Give at least three sample sentences to illustrate how the expression is used in context.\n\n For instance,\n Idiom: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt's a done deal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n Definition: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe agree. Everything has been decided. We're ready to sign the contract.\n\n Examples:\n 1. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe bank has confirmed the loan agreement, so It's a done deal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n 2. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe court has approved the restructuring plan, so it's a done deal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n 3. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Senior Partner has signed my promotion papers, so it's a done deal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n If a student came to me with an idiom he wanted explained, like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa rotten egg ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa little stinker,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we would follow the above formula, and we would work it through together, discussing and explaining the words and situations as we went along, to the point where we could finally get the student using the expression in sample sentences referring to life situations of his own...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80aebe6dd8da69e1963c45392a1a84730defcf43","amp;dn":"Idioms+and+Expressions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80aebe6dd8da69e1963c45392a1a84730defcf43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,174,190,109,216,218,105,225,150,60,69,57,42,26,132,115,13,239,207,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
