In this Unreported World, which transmits three days before that critical date, Ade Adepitan travels to Kenya to hear allegations of continued doping and corruption. Kenyan long-distance runners often dominate at the Olympics, at World Championships and on the professional marathon circuit. As Adepitan says, 'Running to Kenyans is like football to Brazilians: they absolutely love it.' But Adepitan finds Kenyan athletics in crisis. Since 2012 more than 40 athletes have failed doping tests. The International Association of Athletics Federations, run by Sebastian Coe, has suspended the CEO of Athletics Kenya as a result of allegations - which he denies - that he's requested bribes from athletes to suppress positive doping results. The World Anti-Doping Agency has given Kenya a succession of deadlines to show it's tackling doping, all of which have been missed.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/16/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/The-Betrayal-of-Kenya-s-Athletes-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~3052Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 550 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0d76dbbee67723124e763f9880c8e2c96d582f","amp;dn":"Ch4+Unreported+World+2016+The+Betrayal+of+Kenyas+Athletes+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0d76dbbee67723124e763f9880c8e2c96d582f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,13,118,219,190,230,119,35,18,78,118,63,152,128,200,226,201,109,88,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
