Full-color layouts presenting painters, street artists, sculptors, cartoonists, and photographers are featured along with interviews, rare portfolios, sketches, and reviews. Juxtapoz is the brainchild of Robert Williams, world-renowned artist and father of the widely popular school of cartoon surrealism. Target audience is teens to hip adults.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24407f6e8a630c3d6ec2a85074c11ce6a316b9a3","amp;dn":"Juxtapoz+Art+%26amp%3B+Culture+Magazine+-+July+2014++USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24407f6e8a630c3d6ec2a85074c11ce6a316b9a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,64,127,110,138,99,12,61,110,194,168,80,116,193,28,230,163,22,185,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
