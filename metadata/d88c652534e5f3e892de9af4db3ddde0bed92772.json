Abandoned by all but its captain, OdysseyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sacrifice covered the withdrawal of countless troops as the Drasin assault ravaged the planet. When Captain Eric Weston finally emerges from the rubble, impossibly alive thanks to the mysterious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gaia,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he knows with the Drasin itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kill or be killed.\n\nBut not all of the heavens have proven hostile. The Priminae have felt the full brunt of Drasin aggression on their own home world, and they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave humanity to face annihilation alone. Together with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left of the crews of the Odyssey and other starships, they race to join Weston and his group of Earth-bound survivors for a desperate last stand.\n\nThe final battle of the Drasin War brings bestselling author Evan CurrieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Odyssey One series to its shattering conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88c652534e5f3e892de9af4db3ddde0bed92772","amp;dn":"Evan+Currie+-+Out+of+the+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88c652534e5f3e892de9af4db3ddde0bed92772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,140,101,37,52,229,243,232,146,222,154,244,219,61,221,224,190,217,39,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
