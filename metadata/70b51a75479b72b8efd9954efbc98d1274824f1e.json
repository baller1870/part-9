This new edition builds on that legacy while addressing cutting-edge trends in the chemistry laboratoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including forensic chemistry and environmental and green chemistry.\n \nAs always, the new edition of Chemistry in the Laboratory offers precise, easy-to-follow instructions, helpful illustrations, and an emphasis throughout on laboratory safety. Again, throughout, a Consider This feature encourages users to expand the principles of the experiment into interesting applications, open-ended experiments, or unexplored corners. Most experiments in the manual can be completed in one lab session, but some can be linked or extended for a multi-lab project.\n\n\n# 550 pages\n# Publisher: W. H.
