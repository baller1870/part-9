Every time you open Picasa, it automatically locates all your pictures (even ones you forgot you had) and sorts them into visual albums organized by date with folder names you will recognize. You can drag and drop to arrange your albums and make labels to create new groups. Picasa makes sure your pictures are always organized.\n\nPicasa also makes advanced editing simple by putting one-click fixes and powerful effects at your fingertips. And Picasa makes it a snap to share your pictures, you can email, print photos home, make gift CDs, instantly share your images and albums, and even post pictures on your own blog.\n\nThe latest version includes Web Albums (along with other improvements), but requires that you request an account from Google.\n\n[img]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/3527/xlu6ncekv.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762c48fbbf035f3bc76d7693fc5ef9222f269de2","amp;dn":"Picasa+3.9+setup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762c48fbbf035f3bc76d7693fc5ef9222f269de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,44,72,251,191,3,95,59,199,109,118,147,252,94,249,34,47,38,157,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
