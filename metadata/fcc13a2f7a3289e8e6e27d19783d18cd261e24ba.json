Animal bones were consulted as oracles to answer the great questions of life and death, and ancestral spirits were thought to roam the earth, negotiating with the gods on behalf of the living. From the legends of the Eight Immortals to the teachings of Confucius, &quot;Chinese Mythology A to Z, Second Edition&quot; provides a refreshing, insightful look at the stories and myths that open a window onto this civilization. Coverage of this title includes: Buddhist deities and legendary characters; animal stories, such as the fox legends; important locations, such as shrines and sacred places; allegorical figures, such as the Jade Emperor, the Rain Master, and the Lord of the Granary; and, more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcc13a2f7a3289e8e6e27d19783d18cd261e24ba","amp;dn":"Chinese+Mythology+A+to+Z+-+Jeremy+Roberts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcc13a2f7a3289e8e6e27d19783d18cd261e24ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,193,58,47,122,50,137,232,230,226,125,25,120,61,24,205,38,30,36,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
