(Pocket Monsters: FireRed &amp; LeafGreen) are enhanced remakes of the original PokÃƒÂ©mon Red and Blue video games, which were released in 1996. The new titles were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released to North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles.\n\nFireRed and LeafGreen are members of the PokÃƒÂ©mon series of role-playing video games. As in previous games, the player controls the player character from an overhead perspective, and participates in turn-based combat encounters. However, new features such as a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access have also been added. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises PokÃƒÂ©mon for use in battle.\n\nThe games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, PokÃƒÂ©mon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12 million copies worldwide.\n\nInstall notes: Double-click the setup package. Menu entry, desktop shortcut and uninstaller will be created automatically.\n\nHave fun playing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a27c99a13a7fab2bc94eade61cd4f6a92184cbd0","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Fire+Red+And+Leaf+Green+%5BHyperdrive25%5D.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a27c99a13a7fab2bc94eade61cd4f6a92184cbd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,124,153,161,58,127,171,43,201,78,173,230,28,212,246,169,33,132,203,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
