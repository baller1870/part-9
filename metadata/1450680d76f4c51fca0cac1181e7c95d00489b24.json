This compilation contains many of the songs that established her as a major star, beginning with She's in love the boy - a song that enabled Trisha to become one of the few ladies in the history of country music to top the American country chart with their first single.\n\nTrisha's other country number one hits featured here include Thinking about you and An American girl (X's and O's). Many of the other songs were country top ten hits for Trisha. How do I live was a huge country hit for Trisha, but it was LeAnn Rimes who had the American pop hit (she also had a big UK pop hit with the song) - but Trisha's version was also a big hit in some other countries around the world, as well as being a minor UK hit. I love both versions of the song but I slightly prefer Trisha's version to LeAnn's. Really, there's not much to choose between them.\n\nOne of my particular favorites is The song remembers when - about how you remember particular events in your life when you hear a particular song. There are many other fine songs including Wrong side of Memphis, Walkaway Joe, The woman before me and a duet with Garth Brooks (In another's eyes).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrisha Yearwood - Songbook: A Collection of Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: \nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997 08 26\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 59 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 257kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
