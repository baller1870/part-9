One of the elder statesmen of the Irish literary world, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest contemporary writers of short stories in the English language and has been described as &quot;the most astute observer of the human condition currently writing in fiction&quot; (Tim Adams, The Observer).\n\nOver the course of his long career Trevor has written several novels and hundreds of short stories, for which he is best known.  He has won the Whitbread Prize three times and has been nominated five times for the Booker Prize, most recently for his novel LOVE AND SUMMER (2009), which was also shortlisted for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2011.  He was awarded an honorary CBE in 1977 for &quot;services to literature&quot;, and was made a Companion of Literature in 1994.
