We are releasing this maintenance shortly after our initial 2014.09 release to fix problems with the NVIDIA driver, and to include a first fix for the Bash shell vulnerability. We also updated Samba file sharing, Kontact accounts and language pack installation. Laptop Mode Tools was replaced by the new TLP to give you better control of your power consumption and achieve a longer battery life with your laptop. With the 2014.09 version we updated Netrunner Rolling to the latest software updates from Manjaro, including Linux kernel 3.14.18 with lots of bugs fixed and new driver support. KDE SC was updated to version 4.14.&quot; See the full release announcement for more information and screenshots.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6507b72897f0416ce0c9bfaa166d2c3c089cb2e1","amp;dn":"Netrunner+Rolling+2014.09.1+KDE4+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6507b72897f0416ce0c9bfaa166d2c3c089cb2e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,7,183,40,151,240,65,108,224,201,191,170,22,109,44,60,8,156,178,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
