Using MatchMover we can find the movements of a real life object and move a 3D object to match. We will begin this project by manually tracking our sequence in MatchMover and exporting it for use in Maya. We will then take our solved camera into our Maya scene and move our object into place. We will then learn how to capture our 3D environment reflections and create some helpful matte layers. Once we have rendered our Maya sequence, we will learn how to combine all of our images in After Effects. We will learn about processing our background footage to capture traveling mattes, as well as many different ways to combine our various mattes to create effects. We will finish by adding a silhouette and color correcting our images.\nTutor\nChris Glick\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/5427/wyoa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img844/5427/wyoa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a3ce4f8035e7573f5b89e1f4a2ffa227068af0","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Object+Tracking+in+MatchMover+and+After+Effects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a3ce4f8035e7573f5b89e1f4a2ffa227068af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,163,206,79,128,53,231,87,63,91,137,225,244,162,255,162,39,6,138,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
