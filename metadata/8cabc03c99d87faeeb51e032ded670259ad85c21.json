He also has written and directed feature films. He won the 2014 Man Booker Prize.\n\nHis first novel, Death of a River Guide (1994), is the tale of Aljaz Cosini, river guide, who lies drowning, reliving his life and the lives of his family and forebears. It was described by The Times Literary Supplement as &quot;one of the most auspicious debuts in Australian writing&quot;. His next book, The Sound of One Hand Clapping (1997), which tells the story of Slovenian immigrants, was a major bestseller, selling more than 150,000 copies in Australia alone. Flanagan's first two novels, declared Kirkus Reviews, &quot;rank with the finest fiction out of Australia since the heyday of Patrick White&quot;.\n\nGould's Book of Fish (2001), FlanaganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third novel, is based on the life of William Buelow Gould, a convict artist, and tells the tale of his love affair with a young black woman in 1828. It went on to win the 2002 Commonwealth Writers' Prize. Flanagan has described these early novels as 'soul histories'. His fourth novel was The Unknown Terrorist (2006), which The New York Times called &quot;stunning ... a brilliant meditation upon the post-9/11 world&quot;. His fifth novel, Wanting (2008) tells two parallel stories: about the novelist Charles Dickens in England, and Mathinna, an Aboriginal orphan adopted by Sir John Franklin, the colonial governor of Van Diemen's Land, and his wife, Lady Jane Franklin. As well as being a New Yorker Book of the Year and Observer Book of the Year, it won the Queensland Premier's Prize, the Western Australian Premier's Prize and the Tasmania Book Prize.\n\nHis most recent novel is The Narrow Road to the Deep North (2013). The life story of Dorrigo Evans, a flawed war hero and survivor of the Death Railway, it has been hailed by The Australian as &quot;beyond comparison ... An immense achievement&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by The Guardian. It won the 2014 Man Booker Prize.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Death of a River Guide (1994)\n\n* The Sound of One Hand Clapping (1997)\n\n* Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish (2001)\n\n* Wanting (2008)\n\n* The Narrow Road to the Deep North (2013)\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Flanagan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Flanagan&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/business/media/richard-flanagan-wins-man-booker-prize-for-tale-of-world-war-ii-pow.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/business/media/richard-flanagan-wins-man-booker-prize-for-tale-of-world-war-ii-pow.html?_r=0&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/15/richard-flanagan-i-lit-the-barbie-with-old-drafts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/15/richard-flanagan-i-lit-the-barbie-with-old-drafts&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.themonthly.com.au/transcript-richard-flanagan-conversation-ramona-koval&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.themonthly.com.au/transcript-richard-flanagan-conversation-ramona-koval&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc745fbe-5547-11e4-b750-00144feab7de.html#axzz3JaFrexhP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc745fbe-5547-11e4-b750-00144feab7de.html#axzz3JaFrexhP&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cabc03c99d87faeeb51e032ded670259ad85c21","amp;dn":"Richard+Flanagan+-+Man+Booker+Winner%2C+2014+%285+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cabc03c99d87faeeb51e032ded670259ad85c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,171,192,60,153,216,127,174,235,81,224,50,222,214,112,37,154,216,92,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
