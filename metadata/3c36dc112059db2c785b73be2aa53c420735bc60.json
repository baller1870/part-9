Ireland's history and literature are well known to many Americans, but the extraordinary collections of her National Gallery have been experienced by relatively few. The exhibition, of which this publication is the accompanying catalogue, includes splendid works by great masters like Claude, David, Hobbema, Poussin, Reynolds, Ruisdael and Velazquez along with important pictures bv lesser known masters such as Drost, Duyster, Faber, Mvtens, Schalcken and Weenix. These paintings, sumptuously illustrated in this full-colour catalogue, will both surprise and delight, and will lead to an appreciation of the range and quality of the collections from the National Gallery of Ireland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c36dc112059db2c785b73be2aa53c420735bc60","amp;dn":"Master+European+Paintings+from+the+National+Gallery+of+Ireland+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c36dc112059db2c785b73be2aa53c420735bc60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,54,220,17,32,89,219,44,120,91,115,190,42,165,60,66,7,53,188,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
