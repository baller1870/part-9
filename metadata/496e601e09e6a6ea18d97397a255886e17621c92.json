Until\nthat point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences.\nHis act, which included his own song &quot;Respect&quot; and a version of the\nRolling Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, was well received by the audience.\nRedding and his backing band\n(Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with\nCooke's &quot;Shake&quot; before he delivered an impulsive speech in which he\nasked the audience if they were the &quot;love crowd&quot;, looking for a big\nresponse. The ballad &quot;I've Been Loving You&quot; followed. The last song\nwas &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, including an additional chorus.\n\n&quot;I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go&quot;, said Redding and left the\nstage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones,\n&quot;I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were\nincluded in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were\nthere? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of\nthe things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it\nbrought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey.&quot;\nAccording to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and\nJimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau\nwrote in Esquire, &quot;The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens\n\n\n\n\n\nLive in Europe is a live album from soul singer Otis Redding. It was\nRedding's first live album as well as the only live album released\nduring his lifetime, issued exactly five months before his death on\nDecember 10, 1967. The album was recorded during the Stax/Volt tour\nof Europe and Redding is backed by Booker T. &amp; the MG's. Recorded at\nthe Olympia Theatre, Paris; March 21, 1967.\n\nThe album is currently available on CD, digitally remastered by\nBill Inglot and Dan Hersch as part of the Atlantic &amp; Atco Remasters\nSeries. In 2003, the album was ranked number 474 on Rolling\nStone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/55183413921731895800.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.geotorrents.com/images/55183413921731895800.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLive In Europe 1967\n\n1.
