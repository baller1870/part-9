His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years oldâ€”when in actuality, heâ€™s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and heâ€™s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his powerâ€”plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irishâ€”to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0268e496af6e82ad8b3bb10ee43898ebacf48e42","amp;dn":"Kevin+Hearne%3A+The+Iron+Druid+Chronicles+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0268e496af6e82ad8b3bb10ee43898ebacf48e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,104,228,150,175,110,130,173,139,59,177,14,228,56,152,235,172,244,142,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
