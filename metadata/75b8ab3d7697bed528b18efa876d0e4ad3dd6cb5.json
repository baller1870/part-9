Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?\n\nThe Casual Vacancy is J.K. RowlingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first novel for adults.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b8ab3d7697bed528b18efa876d0e4ad3dd6cb5","amp;dn":"The+Casual+Vacancy+by+JK+Rowling+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b8ab3d7697bed528b18efa876d0e4ad3dd6cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,184,171,61,118,151,190,213,40,177,142,250,135,109,14,74,211,221,108,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
