Simak (1904-1988). When the Science Fiction Writers of America began bestowing their Grand Master awards, Simak was the third writer so honored. Only Robert Heinlein and Jack Williamson preceded him, and he received his award before such luminaries as Fritz Leiber, Isaac Asimov, and Ray Bradbury. Simak earned this distinction by producing, over a long period of time, a significant body of popular, respected, often award-winning work, including his classics City and Way Station, and many shorter works, eight of which are contained in this collection.\n\nReaders unfamiliar with Simak are in for a treat. More than half of the stories here were among the best stories of their respective years. &quot;The Big Front Yard&quot; (1958) won a Hugo. &quot;A Death in the House&quot; (1959) was selected by Judith Merril for Year's Best SF: Fifth Annual Edition. &quot;Over the River and Through the Woods&quot; (1965) made the cut for World's Best Science Fiction: 1966 edited by Donald Wollheim.\n\nContents:\n\nA Death in the House\nThe Big Front Yard\nGoodnight Mr. James\nDusty Zebra\nNeighbor\nOver the River &amp; Through the Woods\nConstruction Shack\nGrotto of the Dancing Deer\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\n[tape rip]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2eb99a92fa3277383017bd36464c0d014e0a8f0","amp;dn":"Clifford+D.+Simak+-+Over+the+River+and+Through+the+Woods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2eb99a92fa3277383017bd36464c0d014e0a8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,235,153,169,47,163,39,115,131,1,123,211,100,100,192,208,20,224,168,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
