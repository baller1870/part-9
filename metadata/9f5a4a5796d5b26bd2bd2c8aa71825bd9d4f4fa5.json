The four short films of its portmanteau structure demonstrate Borowczyk&amp;#039;s superb eye for painterly compositions, unusual framing/fragmenting of the body, subtle lighting, and the transformative power of his surreal approach to objects. &quot;I want each object to be something other than neutral,&quot; he told Carlos Clarens in Film Comment. &quot;I want it to take part, because we choose objects in life and we live with them. Through objects you discover human nature.&quot; This is Borowczyk the idiosyncratic animator talking, who, in his meticulous use of lighting, framing and editing, somehow brings objects to life even in his live-action films, encouraging us to think about and question the significance of our tactile/perceptual relationships to them.\n\nTaboo subjects (for the time) like fellatio, masturbation, sex &amp; death (the latter prominent in the vampiric &amp;#039;ErzsÃƒÂ©bet Bathory&amp;#039;), and incest (&amp;#039;Lucrezia Borgia&amp;#039;) are given historical settings. Candlesticks, a wooden doll, ecclesiastical vestments, organ pipes, cucumbers, robes, prayer books, antique erotic drawings (most of these in &amp;#039;ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se Philosophe&amp;#039;) and the sea (&amp;#039;La MarÃƒÂ©e&amp;#039;), assume as important a role in the finely detailed, eroticised mise-en-scÃƒÂ¨ne as the tableau-like human figures. Erotic gestures are ritualised, sexual and religious ecstasy conflate, and the sacred and profane become inseparable. As in much of Borowczyk&amp;#039;s feature work, sex/sexuality becomes a disruptive, primal force engendering obsessive, even subversive, behaviour which threatens the social/moral stability of a particular community.\n-www.btinternet.com-\n\nIn Memoriam, Walerian Borowczyk (21/10/1923 - 3/2/2006)\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\n... simply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f5a4a5796d5b26bd2bd2c8aa71825bd9d4f4fa5","amp;dn":"Walerian+Borowczyk+-+Contes+Immoraux+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f5a4a5796d5b26bd2bd2c8aa71825bd9d4f4fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,90,74,87,150,213,178,107,210,189,44,138,167,24,37,189,157,79,79,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
