The project is backed by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen[1]. RockMelt integrates a unique technique for surfing the web that focuses on Google Search and Social Media, in particular Facebook and Twitter[2]. The browser launched in private beta on November 8, 2010[3]; in order to download it, users are required to connect their facebook account to the website to receive an invitation email[4], RockMelt supports Windows and Mac OS X platforms.\nRockMelt is based on Google's open-source project Chromium, a cross-platform family of browsers (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that use the open-source web layout engine WebKit[5]ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½jointly built by Apple, Google and the open-source communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but have the JavaScript engine replaced by Google's own V8, also open-source. Version 3+ of Flock, an older social web browser project and therefore a primary competitor to Rockmelt, is also based on Chromium.\n\n\nscanned with Bitdefender  + SuperAntiSpyware + Malwarebytes = Malware FREE\n\nENJOY\n       scuba-doo\n\n\nshare the wealth and seed, comments are more then welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2961fc66dd085d080c0ea1cb7804563ca7d1eb52","amp;dn":"Rockmelt+web+browser+%28scuba-doo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2961fc66dd085d080c0ea1cb7804563ca7d1eb52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,97,252,102,221,8,93,8,12,14,161,203,120,4,86,60,167,209,235,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
