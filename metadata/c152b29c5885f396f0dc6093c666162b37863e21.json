One ill-fated day, Kagome locates an ancient well near her home and is abruptly transported through the well and into a feudal Japan, inhabited by demons. There, she encounters Inuyasha, son of a powerful demon father and a human mother, who is pinned to a tree by an enchanted arrow.\n\nKagome frees Inuyasha from the tree before she learns that all of the demons, including Inuyasha, are after the Shikon jewel in her possession. To prevent the jewel from being stolen, Kagome accidentally shoots it with the enchanted arrow, shattering it into thousands of pieces. New allies, Kagome and Inuyasha, join forces with Shippo, a small fox-demon, Miroku, a monk, and Sango, the sole surviving demon-hunter, in order to combat the evil Naraku and recover the fragments of the &quot;Jewel of Four Souls&quot;. But that's just just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nPevious Animation Series Uploaded:\nDeath Note\nFlame Of Recca\nFull Metal Alchemist\nYu Yu Hakusho\nAir Gear\nAvatar\nHellsing Series\nSwat Kats\nSamurai Champaloo\n\nOngoing Series:\nNaruto Eng Dubbed\nBleach Eng Dubbed\nGet backers\nDragon Ball Z\n\nFind these and more at :   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/soagg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/soagg&lt;/a&gt;       \n\nComing next : Season 1 of the series Episodes 015 - 027\nI will upload the whole series as far as I know :)\n\nPlease seed and do write some comments on the quality!!\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c152b29c5885f396f0dc6093c666162b37863e21","amp;dn":"Inuyasha+Season+1%28001-014%29+English+Dubbed+DvDrip-soagg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c152b29c5885f396f0dc6093c666162b37863e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,82,178,156,88,133,243,150,240,220,96,147,198,102,22,43,55,134,62,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
