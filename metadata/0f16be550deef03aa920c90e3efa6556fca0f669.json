The Real Garden of Eden.\nCan we find the Garden of Eden? Bible scholar Dr Francesca Stavrakopoulou thinks so. In the final episode of her series re-examining conventional readings of the Bible, she argues that the Garden of Eden has nothing to do with the origins of humanity, but is rather a story concealing dramatic events about a particular figure in a particular place, two and half thousand years ago. Marshalling compelling evidence from archaeology, Islam and the Bible text itself, she identifies and visits the exact site of Eden. It's a revolutionary theory which challenges some of the most cherished preconceptions about Eden in both Christianity and western culture.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800:1\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 730 MB\nSource: HDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f16be550deef03aa920c90e3efa6556fca0f669","amp;dn":"BBC+Bibles+Buried+Secrets+3of3+HDTV+Xvid+AC3+MVGroup+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f16be550deef03aa920c90e3efa6556fca0f669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,22,190,85,13,238,240,58,169,32,201,14,62,250,101,86,252,160,246,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
