The series depicts an alternate Marvel universe, its characters drawn and portrayed in a Manga-like style. Three volumes were published for the series, two of which were connected by a continuing story arc with multiple Marvel characters, while the third and fourth series each started a new story and focused on a single character, which were Spider-Man Mangaverse and Jean Grey of an alternate version of X-Men Mangaverse.\n\nInstead of trying to further summarize this tangled web of books, here's a read order for volume 1 from tradereadingorder.com: New Dawn 1, Avengers 1; Ghost Rider 1; Fantastic Four 1; Punisher 1; Spider-Man 1; X-Men 1; Eternity Twilight 1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c9be32b05fe690d56196d269fca918c7582e69b","amp;dn":"Marvel+Mangaverse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c9be32b05fe690d56196d269fca918c7582e69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,155,227,43,5,254,105,13,86,25,109,38,159,202,145,140,117,130,230,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
