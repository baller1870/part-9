Worse yet, heâ€™s relegated to his grandfatherâ€™s old house and rambling scrapyard. To complicate things, the women in his life are pulling from every direction. But Itâ€™s through a bizarre turn of events that Jason is led to a dried up subterranean aquifer hundreds of feet below ground. Here he discovers an advanced alien spacecraft, one that will propel his life in a new direction.\r\n\r\nThe adventure beginsâ€¦ and with it new troubles for Jason: The Craing, an unstoppable interstellar threat, is headed right for Earth. A desperate situation goes from bad to worse as the Alliance crumbles.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Jasonâ€™s unorthodox and impetuous nature seems to work in his favor as he moves up to the captainâ€™s chair. First order of business is to reconnect with his SEAL team compatriots and face this enemy head on. What's at stake? The very survival of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - Scrapyard Ship\r\n02 - Hab 12\r\n03 - Space Vengeance\r\n04 - Realms of Time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984b6c109f8ac08b4705b61f07ca840df140d036","amp;dn":"Mark+Wayne+McGinnis+-+Scrapyard+Ship+%5B1-4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984b6c109f8ac08b4705b61f07ca840df140d036","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,75,108,16,159,138,192,139,71,5,182,31,7,202,132,13,241,64,208,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
