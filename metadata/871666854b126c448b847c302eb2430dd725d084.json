The boxed set of the second season (which debuted in 1985), contains all 21 episodes.\r\n Spielberg himself was very hands-on in the series, and directed many episodes and wrote most, and some themes from his later films show up here.\r\n\r\n Spielberg's visceral direction of the wartime violence, camaraderie, and anxiety is pitch-perfect, and presages some of the most moving moments in Saving Private Ryan.\r\n Part of the fun of this collection is seeing the stars and guest directors Spielberg cajoled into service, including Martin Scorsese, Sam Waterston (with a head of bushy '80s hair), Tim Robbins, Clint Eastwood, Harvey Keitel, and John Lithgow.\r\n The storytelling is crackerjack, and the trip down TV memory lane - priceless!!\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS:\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the links below into your browser to see more screenshots.

On Amazon, the current Season 2 release I see is a listed Japanese set at $438.13!!!!\r\n\r\nThe Complete First Season (DVD) was released on July 18, 2006, in the US.[15] The second season of the series has not been released on DVD in the US yet, but is available in Japan (Region 2, NTSC) and was released there on July 8, 2009. The full series was also released on DVD in Germany (Region 2, PAL) with both English and German dubbed audio as 11 single DVDs or a boxset containing all episodes, which was released on November 20, 2009.\r\n\r\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
