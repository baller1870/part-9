Robert Lifton constructs these case histories through personal interviews and outlines a thematic pattern of death and rebirth, accompanied by feelings of guilt, that characterizes the process of &quot;thought reform.&quot; In a new preface, Lifton addresses the implications of his model for the study of American religious cults.\n\nPublisher \tUniversity of N.
