They were the sinners who taught little Jimmy how to correct the AV so he (and they) could pose as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“final authorityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“uninformedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Christians. All there is in the entire book is seventy-nine lies, manufactured out of thin air, to bring you to the conclusion that they are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“final authority.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nA real Bible believer could not imagine a more non-Scriptural, pagan, pantheistic, un-Biblical, humanistic fairy tale than WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, if he sat up all night with Pinnochio, Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, and the Billy GoatsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gruff. James White actually tells his clientele that no one should take offense at the NIV stealing Jesus ChristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title from Him in Revelation 22:16 and giving it to the Devil (Isa. 14:12).\nWhat you must keep in mind from start to finish, when reading James White, is that neither he nor any of his friends, peers, mentors, promoters, relatives, or colleagues have any higher authority on this earth than their own opinions.\nWe will prove Ã¢â‚¬Å“beyond the reasonable shadow of a doubtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that they, all of them, without one exception, are totally incompetent to even suggest how a passage, verse, or word in the New Testament should be translated, interpreted, or taught: let alone Ã¢â‚¬Å“corrected.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c95094a581c35454708e16b76d53419e8a48def","amp;dn":"The+Scholarship+Only+Controversy+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c95094a581c35454708e16b76d53419e8a48def","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,149,9,74,88,28,53,69,71,8,225,107,118,213,52,25,232,164,141,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
