Suitable for both undergraduates and postgraduates, it focuses on laboratory techniques rather than computer-simulated data. It also guides the reader through the process of communicating experimental results in a variety of formats, including posters, oral presentations and project reports.\n\nSplit into three main areas, the following topics are covered in detail: \n\nPreparation for Experimental Pharmacology\n\nLegal aspects\nFundamentals of Pharmacology\nDefinitions, calculations and statistics\nExperiments in Pharmacology\n\nMicrotitre-based techniques using isolated cells\nIn vitro techniques using isolated tissues and organs\nBiochemical techniques using cell-free systems\nCommunicating experimental results\n\nData presentation\nHow to write scientific reports\nPharmacological literature\nSupported with numerous questions throughout the text, as well as step by step instructions for practical experiments, this book presents an approach to learning pharmacology through an appreciation of authentic experimental data.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2f5de13091a635f575bc791db52fdbafcfc7bb","amp;dn":"Practical+Pharmacology+for+the+Pharmaceutical+Sciences+%5BPDF%5D%7ESto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2f5de13091a635f575bc791db52fdbafcfc7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,47,93,225,48,145,166,53,245,117,188,121,29,181,47,219,175,207,199,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
