Very much to my complete amazement, somebody has one graded 9.6 on ebay right now with a $129 buy it now price. lol Comic collecting is a funny thing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Floyd Farland, Man of the Future'\n\nEclipse Books, 1987, 51 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Chris Ware\n\nVisually, this books is NOTHING like any of Ware's later work. Done in a large blocky black style, none of the intricacies and detail of his later books is apparent here. It's well-written, though, and funny, even if his apparent belief that most everything kind of sucks and none of us are achieving our full potential is already clear. Oh... and he's already saying, 'god...', which made me laugh.\n\nOther books by Chris Ware...\n\nBuilding Stories &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8639320/Chris_Ware_-_Building_Stories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8639320/Chris_Ware_-_Building_Stories&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe ACME Novelty Library &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7588673/The_Acme_Novelty_Library_(Restored)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7588673/The_Acme_Novelty_Library_(Restored)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7719750/The_Acme_Novelty_Library_19-20_(Add-On)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7719750/The_Acme_Novelty_Library_19-20_(Add-On)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4556aa98f6f187163e44af5673cd72f6ecefd2d3","amp;dn":"Chris+Ware+-+Floyd+Farland%2C+Man+of+the+Future+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4556aa98f6f187163e44af5673cd72f6ecefd2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,86,170,152,246,241,135,22,62,68,175,86,115,205,114,246,236,239,210,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
