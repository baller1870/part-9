A man of his age (73 years old) proves he knows his stuff.\n\nHe talks about many things (the &quot;new vacuum ab tech that is hot now...they were doing in the 60's and earlier), supplements, bodybuilding here and now and, other stuff.  Even a bit about his cardio he did.\n\nA truely intellegent man with still plenty of knowledge to pass along.  I got this vid from a bud of mine who bought it when he was in Maine at a gym.\n\nThe quality (video/audio) is okay.  However, the interviewer should have left the man talk more and, perhaps had said a bit less.  The camera operator should be ashamed with the work done (not the best) however, the knowledge and the subjected interviewed is great.\n\nLooking to up some Sergio next, Mr. HeavyDuty himself (Mike Mentzer) and others ASAP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:034cbfe283fa25104c61ce727c7a564f2954effb","amp;dn":"Bodybuilding+video+-+Frank+Zane+Interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"034cbfe283fa25104c61ce727c7a564f2954effb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,76,191,226,131,250,37,16,76,97,206,114,124,122,86,79,41,84,239,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
