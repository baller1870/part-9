While I am more able to provide current issues, IF I can find what you are looking for I will try and post it for you.  Nemesis43 on KAT has far more resources than I and is a better bet, but I will do what I can to help the communities.  Please message me privately for requests so as not to clutter up comment sections with unrelated material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December, 2010, Boom! Studios announced they would be publishing a new Hellraiser miniseries, written by Clive Barker and Christopher Monfette, beginning March 2011, and would also be reprinting select Epic Comics under the title Hellraiser: Masterworks. Boom! has continued to release new Hellraiser comics and have plans for more in the future, including Hellraiser: Bestiary #1 which is set to be released August 2014. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis collection was gathered from other torrents.  If anyone knows who the scanner or group source are of untagged comics, please let me know and I will give proper credit.
