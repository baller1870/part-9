Who was the couple prior? John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Nearly five years since the release of their last collaborative album Kasey and Shane have braved the perils of a married-couple-locking-themselves-into-a-small-space and have recorded Wreck &amp; Ruin, the highly anticipated follow up to their 2008 platinum #1 hit album RattlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bones.\n\nKasey and Shane said Ã¢â‚¬Å“Having been almost five years since we made RattlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bones we thought it was time to 'Tempt Fate' and challenge our marriage by making another album together! Ã¢â‚¬Å“We have both made solo albums in between but in the back of our minds we always knew we would end up making music together again. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The writing process fell into place easier than we had planned so we grabbed some musician friends and recorded us all jamming the songs on a farm for a week. Wreck &amp; Ruin was born and gave us a chance to revisit the sounds of music that we love to make together where it can be 'traditional' but not 'conventional'Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe cover artwork for Wreck &amp; Ruinwas commissioned from UK based Australian artist Kerry Evans. The album is co-produced by Nash Chambers, Shane Nicholson and Kasey Chambers and was recorded at Foggy Mountain Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d9e354ed3ffc90870e55fc27588a705d1db5615","amp;dn":"Kasey+Chambers+-+Wreck+%26amp%3B+Ruin+%5BZypheiron%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d9e354ed3ffc90870e55fc27588a705d1db5615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,158,53,78,211,255,201,8,112,229,95,194,117,136,167,5,209,219,86,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
