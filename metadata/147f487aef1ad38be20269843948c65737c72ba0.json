(Pro) provides many advantages over the standard adb \n\nscreenrecord utility. Some of the highlights include:\nÃ¢â€“Âª No need to be tied to your computer while recording.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Longer screen recording with Audio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ record for up to 1 hour.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Audio recording via the mic.\nÃ¢â€“Âª A beautiful user interface Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no more messing with the command \n\nline/terminal.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Save your favourite configurations as Presets.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Automatically show screen touches for the duration of your recording.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Customisable countdown timer so that you can get your screen \n\nrecording set-up perfectly.\nÃ¢â€“Âª Shake your device, or simply switch your screen off, to stop your \n\nrecording early.\n\n\nFAQs:\n* Why can't I install Rec. on my device?\nYour phone/tablet must be running Android 4.4 Kit Kat or higher. You \n\nalso need a rooted device for Rec. to function correctly/at all.\n* Can Rec. record audio?\nYes! Audio is recorded via the mic.\nRec. Pro users can record video + audio for up to 1 hour, whereas Rec \n\n(free) users can try out recording with audio for 30 seconds in order to \n\ntest whether it works properly on their device before purchasing the \n\nupgrade.\n* Why is the recording laggy and slow on my Samsung Galaxy \n\nS2/S3/Note/...?\nThis seems to be an issue with Exynos-based devices not playing nicely \n\nwith the native screenrecord function, so there's not a lot I can do \n\nabout it right now (I also don't have access to any Samsung devices). \n\nSorry!\n* Does Rec. work with Intel x86 based devices?\nI have no idea! Unfortunately, I don't have access to any x86 devices \n\nrunning Android 4.4+, but if you try it, please let me know how you get \n\non.\n* Are there any other known issues?\nEnabling the Audio option may cause the recording to fail on the LG G2. \n\nI will attempt to resolve this as soon as I have access to an LG G2 \n\ndevice to test with.\n\n\nTop Tips:\n1. Disable notifications in your Superuser app to prevent the \n\nnotifications from appearing in the beginning of your recordings.\n2. Switch the Size width/height values to flip the recording orientation.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\nTested on a Nexus 5/7, running stock rooted 4.4 Kit Kat, but it has been \n\nreported to work fine on other ROMs and devices also.\nUnfortunately, I do not have the time or resources to test any other \n\ndevice/ROM combinations, so your mileage may vary.\n\nFeel free to get in touch if you have any problems though.\n\n\nBy Doug Stamper","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147f487aef1ad38be20269843948c65737c72ba0","amp;dn":"Rec.+Screen+Recorder+%28+APK+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147f487aef1ad38be20269843948c65737c72ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,127,72,122,239,26,211,139,226,2,105,132,57,72,198,87,55,199,43,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
