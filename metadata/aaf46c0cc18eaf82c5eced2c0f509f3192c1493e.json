Theatrically on \npar with The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miz is drawn from the Victor Hugo \nnovel of the same name. The story chronicles the life of Jean Valjean, a \nsimple Frenchman who was arrested as a youth for stealing a loaf of bread. \nAfter serving five years for that crime, as well as an additional 14 for \nattempted escape, Valjean is released on parole. Upon changing his name \nand eluding his parole officer, Valjean becomes the surrogate father of a \nyoung girl and a mayor as the French Revolution sets in. As the war rages, \nhe finds that he cannot change the man he is. Les Miserables is typical of \ntheater in the '80s, with extravagant effects and large full-cast numbers. The \nbeautiful score is full of emotion and humor, including such memorable and \nnoteworthy songs as &quot;Look Down,&quot; &quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?,&quot; &quot;Bring \nHim Home,&quot; &quot;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,&quot; and the ubiquitous &quot;On My \nOwn.&quot; The original London cast recording is considered by many to be \nsuperior to various other releases of Les Miz, including the Broadway cast. \nColm Wilkinson and Frances Ruffelle originate here the roles they played in \nthe Broadway cast, joined by Patti LuPone and Michael Ball. An important \naddition to a collection for those who want a nearly complete version but who \ndon't need the full symphonic version.\n\nProduct Details\nRelease Date: 6/1/2004\nLabel: First Night (Red)\nCatalog Number: 73362\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf46c0cc18eaf82c5eced2c0f509f3192c1493e","amp;dn":"Original+London+Cast+Recording+-+Les+Miserables+%281985%29+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf46c0cc18eaf82c5eced2c0f509f3192c1493e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,244,108,12,193,142,175,130,197,236,237,44,15,80,159,49,146,193,73,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
