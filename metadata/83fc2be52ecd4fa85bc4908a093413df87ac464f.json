It was the final album released by the band until their 1994 reunion Far From Home. The album featured Jim Capaldi on drums, keyboards and vocals; Rosko Gee on bass guitar; Steve Winwood on guitar, keyboards, and vocals; and Chris Wood on flute and saxophone. (Percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah was fired prior to the album's completion, but his contributions are heard on two of its tracks.) The album uses a broader variety of keyboard instruments than previous Traffic albums, adding Moog and Mellotron to their repertoire.\n\nWhen the Eagle Flies was the band's fourth consecutive studio album to reach the American Top Ten and have gold album status. It was far less successful in the United Kingdom, where it entered the charts at number 31 only to drop off the following week. Traffic toured to support the release, but they disbanded in the middle of the tour in 1974.\n\nThe Chris Wood composition &quot;Moonchild Vulcan&quot; was recorded for the album, but ultimately left out in favour of &quot;Memories of a Rock N' Rolla&quot;.[3] The song was played on the supporting tour for the album, however, and a live recording by Traffic was later released on Wood's 2008 solo album Vulcan.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3] [2008 Japanese SHM-CD]\n\n\n    &quot;Something New&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Dream Gerrard&quot; (Steve Winwood, Vivian Stanshall) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:03\n    &quot;Graveyard People&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:05\n    &quot;Walking in the Wind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:48\n    &quot;Memories of a Rock N' Rolla&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:50\n    &quot;Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:24\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83fc2be52ecd4fa85bc4908a093413df87ac464f","amp;dn":"Traffic+-+When+The+Eagle+Flies+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83fc2be52ecd4fa85bc4908a093413df87ac464f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,252,43,229,46,205,79,168,91,196,144,138,9,52,19,223,135,172,70,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
