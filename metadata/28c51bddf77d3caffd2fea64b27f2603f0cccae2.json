Without warning, the Serpent King Orochi has begun an invasion. Using the immense power, allowing for break time and space, Orochi kidnapped the strongest warriors and bravest of Ancient China and Feudal Japan to test their skills in battle with the best soldiers. None of the armies could not resist authority Orochi. In the field remains less than the heroes, who continued to resist the King Snake. 96 characters instead of 79 in the original, all new old costumes optional, new campaigns, new game modes, new items. In general, all publishers would normally be only a supplement, but Koei served as the third part of the WMO.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c51bddf77d3caffd2fea64b27f2603f0cccae2","amp;dn":"Musou+Orochi+Z+%5BMULTI2%5D%5BPCDVD%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c51bddf77d3caffd2fea64b27f2603f0cccae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,197,27,221,247,125,60,175,253,47,234,100,178,127,38,3,240,204,202,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
