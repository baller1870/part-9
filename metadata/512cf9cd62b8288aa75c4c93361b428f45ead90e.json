In Becoming Kuan Yin, Levine's first new book in many years, he turns to the legend of Kuan Yin, the Bodhistitva venerated by East Asian Buddhists for her compassion.\n\nIn Becoming Kuan Yin, Levine shares the tale of Miao Shan, born centuries ago to a cruel king who wanted her to marry a wealthy but uncaring man. This is the story of how Miao Shan refused to follow the path her father had in mind and, instead, became Kuan Yin, the first acknowledged female Buddha who watches over the dying and those who work with them.\n\nLevine weaves together story and practice and helps readers discover their own infinite capacity for mercy and compassion under difficult circumstances. This book will have resonance for Kuan Yin's millions of followers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Good news: the cosmos is compassionate, and Stephen Levine is a trustworthy guide to the Universal Portal.
