Copy the content(3 files) from the SKIDROW folder (where you mounted or burned) to your\n  installation directory (C: Program Files (x86) (if you have win 64 bit)ChessBase/ChessProgram12) and overwrite\n5.

Browse and locate it, when you're being asked to insert the TALK or VIDEO CD.\n  You can also select custom/complete install during setup. To get around that issue.  \n\nWhy in rar? Because iso is 4.32 GB.\nRared is only 3.80 GB. So why not save 500 MB ;-)\nI downloaded it from a private site.\nCredits deserved by all who keep seeding it.
