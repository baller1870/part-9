Recorded over several live performances in February 1978, the album is an interesting departure from the jazz fusion which both keyboardists specialize in playing.\n\n\n Since Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock had by 1978 spent several years mostly playing electric keyboards, their acoustic duet tour surprised many listeners who thought that they would always specialize in fusion. This double album contains many fine performances including lengthy versions of &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; and &quot;La Fiesta&quot; but it is the striding by Corea and Hancock on &quot;Liza&quot; that is most unique.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n CD1 #01 - Someday My Prince Will Come\n CD1 #02 - Liza (All The Clouds'll Roll Away)\n CD1 #03 - Button Up\n\n CD2 #01 - February Moment\n CD2 #02 - Maiden Voyage\n CD2 #03 - La Fiesta","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a20400a950162340c75d185492fe1bf75cb632f","amp;dn":"Herbie+Hancock%2C+Chick+Corea+-In+Concert+%281978%2F2013%29+24%2F96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a20400a950162340c75d185492fe1bf75cb632f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,32,64,10,149,1,98,52,12,117,209,133,73,47,225,191,117,203,99,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
