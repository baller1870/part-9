It recognises that hazards, like poverty, will always be with us but that concerted and organised societal response can prevent a hazard becoming a disaster. By bringing together geoscientists, social scientists and those concerned with the administration of international science and international disaster reduction, this book details the state-of-the-science as well as the state-of-the-response in natural hazards.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9f07cb6cdacecf62642f351ceea79cedb647f6","amp;dn":"Geophysical+Hazards%3A+Minimizing+Risk%2C+Maximizing+Awareness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9f07cb6cdacecf62642f351ceea79cedb647f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,159,7,203,108,218,206,207,98,100,47,53,28,238,167,156,237,182,71,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
