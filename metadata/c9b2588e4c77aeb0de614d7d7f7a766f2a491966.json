(orangecow.org)\n\n  Mark 4 (Recobbled Cut Mk4) September 2013 work in progress 1080p HD H.264 file.\n\n   Nearly 30 years in the making, a labor of love by a team of animation greats,\n this was to be the masterpiece of Williams' career, perhaps the most ambitious \nindependent animated film ever conceived. Williams funded the film over the \nyears with his millions of dollars of his own money, until after Roger Rabbit, \nWarner Brothers decided to fund the film. The Thief was the inspiration for \nDisney's film Aladdin, which proved to be its undoing. After over two decades of \nwork, the film was taken away from Williams when he couldn't meet his deadline. \nIt was eventually recut and destroyed, bought by Disney and destroyed further.\n\nDirected by Richard Williams\nScreenplay by Richard Williams and Margaret French\nMaster animator Ken Harris\nProduced by Imogen Sutton and Richard Williams\n\n&quot;Animation among the most glorious and lively ever created.&quot; - The New York Times\n\nThis is Garrett Gilchrist's restoration of Richard Williams' unfinished animated\nclassic. Still a work in progress, this has been &quot;cobbled&quot; together from the many\nexisting cuts (and rare footage) to bring the film much closer to its intended form.\n\nNearly the entire film has been carefully restored frame by frame in Photoshop,\nAfter Effects, Final Cut Pro and other programs, with scenes recreated to tell\nthe story like never before. Dirt and splices have been removed and new special\neffects created.\n\nThe aim of the Recobbled Cut is to provide the most complete and watchable version\nthat is faithful to Richard Williams' vision, using the best available quality\naudio and video. This latest version includes 30 minutes of scenes in HD from\n35mm film, as well as new artwork and a great deal of dirt removal.\n\nVisit orangecow . org / board for more information.\n\nOr the Facebook group at Facebook . com / groups / thiefandthecobbler\n\n&quot;It is written among the limitless constellations of the celestial heavens, and \nin the depths of the emerald seas, and upon every grain of sand in the vast \ndeserts, that the world which we see is an outward and visible dream, of an \ninward and invisible reality ... Once upon a time there was a golden city. In \nthe centre of the golden city, atop the tallest minaret, were three golden \nballs. The ancients had prophesied that if the three golden balls were ever \ntaken away, harmony would yield to discord, and the city would fall to \ndestruction and death. But... the mystics had also foretold that the city might\n be saved by the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things. In the\n city there dwelt a lowly shoemaker, who was known as Tack the Cobbler. Also in\n the city... existed a Thief, who shall be ... nameless.&quot;\n\nAlso known (in horrifically butchered form) as Arabian Knight and The Princess \nand the Cobbler.\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b2588e4c77aeb0de614d7d7f7a766f2a491966","amp;dn":"The+Thief+and+the+Cobbler+Recobbled+Cut+Mark+4+%28Sept+13+Mk4+WIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b2588e4c77aeb0de614d7d7f7a766f2a491966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,178,88,142,76,119,174,176,222,97,77,125,127,122,118,111,42,73,25,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
