Her name became an adjective: Beattiesque. Subtle, wry, and unnerving, she is a master observer of the unraveling of the American family, and also of the myriad small occurrences and affinities that unite us. Her characters, over nearly four decades, have moved from lives of fickle desire to the burdens and inhibitions of adulthood and on to failed aspirations, sloppy divorces, and sometimes enlightenment, even grace.\n\nEach Beattie story, says Margaret Atwood, is &quot;like a fresh bulletin from the front: we snatch it up, eager to know whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening out there on the edge of that shifting and dubious no-manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-land known as interpersonal relations.&quot; With an unparalleled gift for dialogue and laser wit, she delivers flash reports on the cultural landscape of her time. Ann Beattie: The New Yorker Stories is the perfect initiation for readers new to this iconic American writer and a glorious return for those who have known and loved her work for decades","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad5ba764f410c87cba131fcbff2335b7568364b","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+Stories+by+Ann+Beattie+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad5ba764f410c87cba131fcbff2335b7568364b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,213,186,118,79,65,12,135,203,161,49,252,191,242,51,91,117,104,54,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
