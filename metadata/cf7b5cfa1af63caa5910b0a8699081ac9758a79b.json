It is a \ngood reference for most things if you want a quick \nbrief on Jewish topics. \nEach article ends with a bibliographical note (further \nreading references like books or other sources). \nThe text of a volume can be searched with the search \noption in Acrobat Reader. \n\nOf course, as is often the case with long running \nencyclopedias (this one was started in Germany in the \nlate 1920ies) they tend to be slightly conservative. \nFor instance the &quot;hot potatoe&quot; issue of revising \nthe history of Israel's founding in 1948 (connected \nwith the movement of the &quot;New Historians&quot; and &quot;Post-\nZionism&quot;) is not mentioned in a seperate article, \nnor any the individual new historians themselves (Benny \nMorris, Ilan Pappe, Avi Shlaim, Tom Segev). \n\nWith some heavy competion from online sources like \nWikipedia and Wikisources which are expanding daily \nthis encyclopedia faces an uphill battle. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7b5cfa1af63caa5910b0a8699081ac9758a79b","amp;dn":"Jewish+Encyclopedia+%282007%2C+PDF%29+People+-+Culture+-+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7b5cfa1af63caa5910b0a8699081ac9758a79b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,123,92,250,26,246,60,170,89,16,176,168,105,144,129,172,151,88,167,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
