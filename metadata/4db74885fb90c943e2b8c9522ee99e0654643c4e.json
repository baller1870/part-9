In a tenacious daze, he leaves the city and relocates to a small town in the American heartland. But what is this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œescapeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ really about?\n\nAs the story unfolds, moving between the present and the past, we begin to understand this confounding yet fascinating character, and how heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gotten to where he is. And isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. And we meet Hana: a sweet, smart, first-generation Japanese American artist with whom he had made a blissful life. But now sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gone. Did Asterios do something to drive her away? What has happened to her? Is she even alive? All the questions will be answered, eventually.\n\nIn the meantime, we are enthralled by MazzucchelliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extraordinarily imagined world of brilliantly conceived eccentrics, sharply observed social mores, and deftly depicted asides on everything from design theory to the nature of human perception.\n\nAsterios Polyp is David MazzucchelliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterpiece: a great American graphic novel.
