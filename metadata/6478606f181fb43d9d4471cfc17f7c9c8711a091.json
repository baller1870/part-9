As the film opens, we see him dispatching two of the miscreants during a driving rainstorm. Though the victims are deserving of their fate, the script is careful to detail the moral deterioration of Scott, who'd quit his sheriff's job to go on this unauthorized death hunt. Also turning up is Bill Master (Lee Marvin), not one of the bandits per se but actually a villain from Stride's past who happens upon the situation and sees a chance to make off with some loot. This film marked one of the few Randolph Scott/Budd Boetticher collaborations not released by Columbia Pictures. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049743/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049743/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-49743/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-49743/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:18:02\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 592x336 16/9\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1128 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6478606f181fb43d9d4471cfc17f7c9c8711a091","amp;dn":"Seven+Men+from+Now+%281956%29+Randolph+Scott+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6478606f181fb43d9d4471cfc17f7c9c8711a091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,120,96,111,24,31,180,61,157,68,113,207,193,127,124,156,135,17,160,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
