Their music is demonstrative of high levels of compositional and improvisational skill.\n\nBeing one of the groups most frequently associated with both fusion and jazz-rock may be seen as ironic, as Joe Zawinul once said in a Down Beat interview he &quot;did not understand what fusion meant&quot; and Pat Metheny once revealed he and Jaco Pastorius sometimes used to talk about how much they disliked that musical style called &quot;jazz-rock&quot;.\n\n\n[b]Brought to you by TQMP.
