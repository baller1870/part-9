Bittinger\nEnglish\nISBN: 0321466209 \nedition 2007 \nPDF \n1062 pages \n22.3 MB\n\n\nThese authors have created a book to really help students visualize mathematics for better comprehension. By creating algebraic visual side-by-sides to solve various problems in the examples, the authors show students the relationship of the algebraic solution with the visual, often graphical, solution. In addition, the authors have added a variety of new tools to help students better use the book for maximum effectiveness to not only pass the course, but truly understand the material.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d4690c346cdde109e923acebb63b2a40cb477b","amp;dn":"Algebra+and+Trigonometry-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d4690c346cdde109e923acebb63b2a40cb477b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,212,105,12,52,108,221,225,9,233,35,172,235,182,59,42,64,203,71,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
