Since his hip-hop beginnings and his part in the TTC adventure (and the Institubes record label), Para One has not worried too much about classifications and genres, wide gaps having been his trademark. He is a solo artist on Ã¢â‚¬Å“EpiphanieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a milestone of 2.0 french touch) or Ã¢â‚¬Å“PassionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (his last album, more pop mid-tempo and introspective), a cinema composer (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Naissance des pieuvresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by CÃƒÂ©line Sciamma), a producer of seemingly distant projects for Birdy Nam Nam or Micky Green, a record company boss (the fantastic Marble Music), a director in his spare time, and even an actor, but, more than ever, he is a DJ capable of switching from hip-hop to house or techno, from UK garage to old school vibes and future turbines.\n\n    Among a thousand projects, Para One is back on the dance floor with Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a new album which was not meant to be one, but believe it or not: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serious stuff! Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ã¢â‚¬ËœPassionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album is the background for this, as I decided to reshape it for my live act, explains Para One. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve rebuilt the tracks entirely, making live versions for festivals and bigger clubs. Then I found myself with a totally different album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a live album. The tracks have been modified and reinterpreted. Subtlety was not really an option, it had to hit kind of hard. The tracks had to sound real in a club situation and people are now meant to dance to them! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtreasure huntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kind of record with many references. It sounds like my DJ sets, when I mix many things and styles, old and new, because thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how a club should sound. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a place where memories belong.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n    The pop, melancholic and highly danceable Ã¢â‚¬Å“PassionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, was meant to be listened to at home or on quiet dance floors, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ only retains the melodies and vocal hooks. It smells like sweat, joy and abandoned bodies. Packed with English acid house piano, huge beats, elegiac vocals, references to UK Garage, filtered french touch and house, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dives into the heart of dance music. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 3.0 rave emblem, a daring record to make people dance without selling out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c891fe5ce1c127f4ae0e83f667a4298644c60995","amp;dn":"Para+One+-+Club+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c891fe5ce1c127f4ae0e83f667a4298644c60995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,145,254,92,225,193,39,244,174,14,131,246,103,164,41,134,68,198,9,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
