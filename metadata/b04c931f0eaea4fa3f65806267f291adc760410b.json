This is the inner route from the self to the Self. The subjective states of the mystic are of great interest, but historically never have been clarified to the degree presented in this semi-autobiographical account that also provides the means by which to identify their rare occurrence, and thus describe the core characteristics of Spiritual Truth. Devoid of ecclesiastical doctrine or religious belief systems, the pristine essence of all spiritual Truth is revealed in its purity with unprecedcented clarity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04c931f0eaea4fa3f65806267f291adc760410b","amp;dn":"Discovery+of+the+Presence+of+God-+Hawkins+%5BEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+PDF%5D+%5BSto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04c931f0eaea4fa3f65806267f291adc760410b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,76,147,31,14,174,164,250,63,101,128,98,103,242,145,173,199,96,65,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
