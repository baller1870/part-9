It's a relief to leave the Bourne identity \nbehind, but Jason soon finds himself in a life-or-death confrontation \nin which every move might be his last.\n\nSpecter tells him that a former student and son of his old friend was \nkilled by Muslim extremists known as the Eastern Brotherhood. Their \nleader is a man named Semian Icoupov, and he must be stopped because \nhis next terrorist target is believed to be right here in America.\n\nWhile Jason is busy pursuing Icoupov in Russia, he's become a target \nhimself.\n\nInside CI, a battle is brewing for control over the agency.
