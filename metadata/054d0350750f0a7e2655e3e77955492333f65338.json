Blue House contains eight gems of swamp boogie fusion delivered in Ball's supple, slinky voice. Listen to &quot;The Facts of Life,&quot; a slow, sensual, worldly piece of Louisiana soul with an irresistible melody. It takes some living to write this kind of song, and considerable skill to give it this memorable delivery. Consider &quot;St. Gabriel,&quot; a song that sounds so much like a lost blues classic that you'll check the credits to see what Delta legend penned it. Surprise! It's Marcia Ball. Her covers on Blue House are unusually well chosen -- &quot;Fingernails&quot; fits her so well that it's hard to believe it's a Joe Ely tune, and her piano work on &quot;Red Beans&quot; does the song proud. And if her slightly subdued performance on &quot;If This Is Love&quot; isn't quite up to the energy level that the song deserves, it's one cut out of 12, and the other 11 are stellar. Blue House is a marvelous album with plenty of personality and character, and highly recommended. (AllMusic)\n\n01. Red Beans\n02. The Facts Of Life\n03. Down The Road\n04. Blue House\n05.
