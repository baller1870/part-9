It was initially released on Polydor Records in 1979 as a cassette and LP and was re-released as a compact disc in 1993 and 2000. The album was dedicated to Peter Meaden, a prominent Mod and first manager of The Who, who had died a year prior to the album's release.\n\nThe album contains ten of the seventeen tracks from the original rock opera Quadrophenia (as not all of the tracks were used in the film). These are different mixes than those that appear on the 1973 album as they were remixed in 1979 by John Entwistle. The most notable difference is the track &quot;The Real Me&quot; (used for the title sequence of the film) which features a different bass track, more prominent vocals and a more definite ending. Most of the tracks are also edited to be slightly shorter. The soundtrack also includes three tracks by The Who that did not appear on the 1973 album - &quot;Four Faces, &quot;Get Out and Stay Out&quot; and &quot;Joker James.&quot; The latter two songs marked Kenney Jones's first on-record appearance with the Who after taking over on drums for the late Keith Moon.\n\n2000 CD Reissue Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\nA version of the album was released on CD in 2000 (as Music from the Soundtrack of the Who Film Quadrophenia) restoring the track listing to its original configuration, and adding &quot;I'm The Face&quot; to the running order.\n\n    &quot;I Am the Sea&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:03\n    &quot;The Real Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n    &quot;I'm One&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n    &quot;5:15&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:50\n    &quot;Love Reign O'er Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:11\n    &quot;Bell Boy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n    &quot;I've Had Enough&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:11\n    &quot;Helpless Dancer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:22\n    &quot;Doctor Jimmy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:31\n    &quot;Zoot Suit&quot; (The High Numbers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:00\n    &quot;Hi-Heel Sneakers&quot; (Cross Section) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n    &quot;Get Out and Stay Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:26\n    &quot;Four Faces&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n    &quot;Joker James&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n    &quot;The Punk and the Godfather&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:21\n    &quot;Night Train&quot; (James Brown) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n    &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (The Kingsmen) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:41\n    &quot;Green Onions&quot; (Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:46\n    &quot;Rhythm of the Rain&quot; (The Cascades) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:28\n    &quot;He's So Fine&quot; (The Chiffons) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:52\n    &quot;Be My Baby&quot; (The Ronettes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n    &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; (The Crystals) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:09\n    &quot;I'm the Face&quot; (The High Numbers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c879d48e7a3c4ed6a72a1a15c51d7373af77cb30","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Quadrophenia+Original+Movie+Soundtrack+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c879d48e7a3c4ed6a72a1a15c51d7373af77cb30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,121,212,142,122,60,78,214,167,42,26,21,197,29,115,115,175,119,203,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
