ZEROES AND ONES - one of the BEST albums from 2006 - is their first release in over 6 years... but it is brilliant and well worth the wait. \n\nFROM THE ALLMUSIC GUIDE \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;...One of the most resilient and criminally underappreciated bands to rise from the Midwestern underground community, the career of Eleventh Dream Day was a textbook study in alt-rock endurance; despite a nightmarish major-label tenure, the group persevered, ultimately emerging as elder statesmen of the flourishing Chicago music scene,,, In a better world, Eleventh Dream Day would be universally acknowledged as indie rock elder statesmen and one of America\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s great post-punk guitar bands... They built their reputation on blistering live shows and released a string of albums that rocked as hard as anyone in the late \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;80s and early \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;90s. Zeroes and Ones is their first release in six years, but they haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t lost a step. Band leader Rick Rizzo delivers paint-peeling guitar work throughout as well as being the primary writer and vocalist. Doug McCombs (also a founder and member of Tortoise) bass work is as muscular and melodic as ever, driving tracks like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Dissolution\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Lost in the City.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Drummer Janet Bean only takes one lead vocal, but her paired vocals with Rick Rizzo have always been a key part of their sound. Zeroes and Ones is probably the album that best showcases all sides of Eleventh Dream Day, and might just be their best album yet. Let\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s just hope it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s not another six years until the next one...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4071ccb2dc3dbb863e513bbb583ea58bfdee92d1","amp;dn":"ELEVENTH+DREAM+DAY+-+ZEROES+AND+ONES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4071ccb2dc3dbb863e513bbb583ea58bfdee92d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,113,204,178,220,61,187,134,62,81,59,187,88,62,165,139,253,238,146,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
