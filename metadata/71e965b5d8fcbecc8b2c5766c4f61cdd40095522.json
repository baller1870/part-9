This movie features Doris Day and Rod Taylor as the main entertainers, with assistance from actors Arthur Godfrey and Paul Lynde. It is also known as The Spy in Lace Panties.\n\nStarring:\nDoris Day, Rod Taylor, Arthur Godfrey, Dom DeLuise\n\nAxel Nordstrom manages a glass-bottom boat tourist operation in the waters of Santa Catalina Island, California. His widowed daughter, Jennifer Nelson, occasionally helps by donning a mermaid's costume and swimming underneath his boat for the passengers' amusement.\n\nOne day, Jennifer accidentally meets Bruce Templeton when his fishing hook snags her costume. He reels in the bottom half of her mermaid costume, leaving the irate Jennifer floating in the water without pants. Jennifer later discovers that Bruce is the main manager of her part-time place of employment, an aerospace research laboratory.\n\nMr. Templeton later sees Jennifer again at work and recognizes her, and with a hidden purpose, he hires her for a new full-time assignment: to be his &quot;biographer&quot; and to write his life story. His hidden purpose is to make an attempt to win Jennifer's affections. There is a problem. The laboratory's security chief, Homer Cripps, concludes that Jennifer is a Soviet spy, and to prove his suspicions, he has Jennifer surveilled. When she learns of the notion, Jennifer disproves the bumbling Cripps.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : The Glass Bottom Boat (1966).mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 364 MiB\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nOverall bit rate : 481 Kbps\nMovie name : The Glass Bottom Boat (1966)\nEncoded date : UTC 2012-01-07 10:21:52\nWriting application : mkvmerge v5.2.0 ('I can't explain') built on Dec 29 2011 19:29:57\nWriting library : libebml v1.2.3 + libmatroska v1.3.0\n\nVideo\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;612c00080f212d524f51&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nNominal bit rate : 417 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 254 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.457\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.105\nWriting library : x264 core 120 r2120 0c7dab9\n\nAudio\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nFormat settings, SBR : Yes\nFormat settings, PS : No\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nDuration : 1h 45mn\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\nText\nFormat : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\n\nScreens:\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e965b5d8fcbecc8b2c5766c4f61cdd40095522","amp;dn":"The+Glass+Bottom+Boat+%281966%29+MKV+Opt.+English+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e965b5d8fcbecc8b2c5766c4f61cdd40095522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,233,101,181,216,252,190,204,139,44,87,102,196,246,28,221,64,9,85,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
