Starting off with the song that made them stars -- the good-time oldies staple &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; -- and ending up with Tommy James' first solo hit, &quot;Dragging the Line,&quot; this 12-track collection rounds up the group's hits and spotlights the dual nature of their career. The disc is pretty much split between the good-time frat rock staples that the band began their career with (the dramatic &quot;I Think We're Alone Now,&quot; &quot;Mirage,&quot; and the guaranteed dancefloor-filler &quot;Mony Mony&quot;) and the slightly more psychedelic pop sounds they experimented with (the amazing &quot;Crimson and Clover,&quot; &quot;Sweet Cherry Wine,&quot; and &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot;). The cool thing about the band was that their attempts to broaden their sound were just as popular as their simple party songs. That is a rare occurrence in rock; James managed to pull it off by always finding killer hooks and melodies. Just try getting the chorus of &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot; or &quot;Dragging the Line&quot; out of your head after hearing them. Due to the lack of rarities or unusual tracks, devoted fans of Tommy James &amp; the Shondells don't really need this disc. It is aimed at the casual music fan who wants the hits and only the hits, and on that count it certainly succeeds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ec0dde7606c3b35cd80ebb1e923e7850e05aea","amp;dn":"Tommy+James+and+the+Shondells+-+The+Essentials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ec0dde7606c3b35cd80ebb1e923e7850e05aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,236,13,222,118,6,195,179,92,216,14,187,30,146,62,120,80,224,90,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
