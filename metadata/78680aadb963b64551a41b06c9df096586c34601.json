About three quarters of the jobs created in the United States since the great recession pay only a bit more than minimum wage. Still, the United States has more millionaires and billionaires than any country ever, and we continue to mint them.\n\n In this eye-opening book, renowned economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen explains that phenomenon: High earners are taking ever more advantage of machine intelligence in data analysis and achieving ever-better results. Meanwhile, low earners who havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t committed to learning, to making the most of new technologies, have poor prospects. Nearly every business sector relies less and less on manual labor, and this fact is forever changing the world of work and wages. A steady, secure life somewhere in the middleÃ¢â‚¬â€averageÃ¢â‚¬â€is over.\n\n With The Great Stagnation, Cowen explained why median wages stagnated over the last four decades; in Average Is Over he reveals the essential nature of the new economy, identifies the best path forward for workers and entrepreneurs, and provides readers with actionable advice to make the most of the new economic landscape. It is a challenging and sober must-read but ultimately exciting, good news. In debates about our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic future, it will be impossible to ignore. \n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78680aadb963b64551a41b06c9df096586c34601","amp;dn":"Average+Is+Over%3A+America+Beyond+Great+Stagnation+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78680aadb963b64551a41b06c9df096586c34601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,104,10,173,185,99,182,69,81,164,27,6,201,223,9,101,134,195,70,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
