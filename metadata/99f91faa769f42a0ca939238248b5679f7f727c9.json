Written by Agatha Christie; Full-cast dramatisation starring June Whitfield as Miss Marple.\n\nGwenda Reed arrives from New Zealand, travelling ahead of her husband with the task of finding the perfect place to make their base. In the quiet village of Dilmouth, she finds a house with immediate appeal. A few renovations will convert it into her ideal home. Then things get very strange indeed. Wanting porch stairs, Gwenda hires a builder to put them in - only to find some old steps, covered up by bushes. She decides on a connecting doorway between the drawing-room and the dining-room, but discovers one already there, now plastered over. When she opens the painted-over doors of an old cupboard to find wallpaper exactly the same as she had imagined, she begins to wonder if she is going mad. It takes Miss Marple to realise that an unsolved murder is behind Gwenda's apparent intuition - but even she does not suspect the murderer will strike again...
