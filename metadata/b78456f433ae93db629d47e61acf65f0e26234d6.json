The trio have worked together for years as Pale 3, composing music for several films directed by Tykwer, most notably Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, and The International. Work on the score for &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; began months before shooting commenced on the film. The orchestra was recorded in Leipzig, Germany with the MDR Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Leipzig Radio Chorus.[38]\n\nThe soundtrack has received praise from critics. Film Music Magazine critic Daniel Schweiger described the soundtrack as &quot;a singular piece of multi-themed astonishment... Yet instead of defining one sound for every era, Klimek, Heil and Tykwer seamlessly merge their motifs across the ages to give Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cloud AtlasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ its rhythms, blending orchestra, pulsating electronics, choruses and a soaring salute to John Adams in an astonishing, captivating score that eventually becomes all things for all personages...&quot;[39] Erin Willard of ScifiMafia described the soundtrack as &quot;cinematic, symphonic, and simply, utterly, exquisitely beautiful... in the wrong hands the opening theme, which is picked up periodically throughout the entire soundtrack, could easily have become cloying or twee or sappy, but happily this hazard was avoided entirely.&quot;[40]\n\nThe soundtrack contains approximately 1.2 hours of music. WaterTower Music released the digital download on October 23, 2012 and the physical CD on November 6, 2012.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 Prelude: The Atlas March 1:15 \t\n2 Cloud Atlas Opening Title 3:46 \t\n3 Travel To Edinburgh 1:42 \t\n4 Luisa's Birthmark 3:00 \t\n5 Cavendish In Distress 1:23 \t\n6 Papa Song 4:15 \t\n7 Sloosha's Hollow 2:59 \t\n8 Sonmi-451 Meets Chang 3:33 \t\n9 Won't Let Go 4:09 \t\n10 Kesselring 1:54 \t\n11 The Escape 5:43 \t\n12 Temple Of Sacrifice 2:03 \t\n13 Catacombs 1:35 \t\n14 Adieu 4:15 \t\n15 New Direction 1:46 \t\n16 All Boundaries Are Conventions 2:38 \t\n17 The Message 2:13 \t\n18 Chasing Luisa Rey 4:53 \t\n19 Sonmi's Discovery 3:23 \t\n20 Death Is Only A Door 3:48 \t\n21 Cloud Atlas Finale 4:17 \t\n22 The Cloud Atlas Sextet For Orchestra 4:57 \t\n23 Cloud Atlas End Title 7:56 \t\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThis is not my rip, but it includes the original extraction log, to which I added cover art, and I also ran the album through Audiochecker to verify that it is 100% CDDA, the audiochecker log and a screenshot are included.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n===================================================================================\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Our lives are not our own.
