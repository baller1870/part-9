His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers, sees Highway as a relic of an old styled military. HighwayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring, the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-luckyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091187/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091187/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Comedy | Drama | War\niMDB Rating: 6,6/10 from 18 489 users\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\nStarring: Clint Eastwood, Marsha Mason, Everett McGill\n\nLength: 02:09:57\nVideo info: H264, 928 kbps, 1000 fps\nAudio info: AAC , 143 kbps , 48000 Hz\n\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/9CUX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/9CUX.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/awDF1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/awDF1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/iY6tJ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/iY6tJ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/cxzdr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/cxzdr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MWRzB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MWRzB.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MAZLY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MAZLY.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15230c58220a764d2e8fade43bacbff120287da7","amp;dn":"Heartbreak+Ridge+1986+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15230c58220a764d2e8fade43bacbff120287da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,35,12,88,34,10,118,77,46,143,173,228,59,172,191,241,32,40,125,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
