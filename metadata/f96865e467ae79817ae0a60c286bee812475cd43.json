The book takes readers inside the lives of real officers struggling with the daily quest to remain mentally healthy in the face of often-gruesome crime scenes. The actual experience of police work is illustrated through case studies and vignettes, and the text offers a template of best practices for those who practice police psychology.\n\nOther insights in this book reveal the practical side of policing, examining the use of psychology in hostage negotiation, interview and interrogation, threat assessment, and criminal profiling. Readers go behind the scenes to watch as police apply psychological principles in actual cases, and then are given the opportunity to match wits with a simulated foe themselves.\n\n\nHardcover: 171 pages\nPublisher: Praeger; 1 edition (May 3, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0313387281\nISBN-13: 978-0313387289","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96865e467ae79817ae0a60c286bee812475cd43","amp;dn":"Police+Psychology+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96865e467ae79817ae0a60c286bee812475cd43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,104,101,228,103,174,121,129,122,224,166,12,40,107,238,129,36,117,205,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
