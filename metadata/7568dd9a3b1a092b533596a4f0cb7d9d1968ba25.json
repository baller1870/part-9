All the books are completely readable, and I think all but the 4th book includes the artwork from inside the book (but I might be wrong; I haven't read these in a long time. Let us know in the comments if you have the time to find out). I didn't make any of these, I just brought them together from different sites around the web. \n\nThe books are:\n1- Fablehaven\n2- Rise of the Evening Star\n3- Grip of the Shadow Plague\n4- Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary\n5- Keys to the Demon Prison\n\nNo RARs or other compression, just 5 great PDF books in a folder. Get a free copy of Adobe Acrobat to read these (Google should find it easily) or grab thethingy's torrent of the full version. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7568dd9a3b1a092b533596a4f0cb7d9d1968ba25","amp;dn":"Brandon+Mull-+Complete+Fablehaven+Series+%281-5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7568dd9a3b1a092b533596a4f0cb7d9d1968ba25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,104,221,154,59,26,9,43,83,53,150,164,240,203,125,157,25,104,186,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
