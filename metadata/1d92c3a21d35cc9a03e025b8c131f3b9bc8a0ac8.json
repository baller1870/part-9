This set contains the solo piano works of Bela Bartok (although I've not organized them by CD; I've instead organized them by work).\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d92c3a21d35cc9a03e025b8c131f3b9bc8a0ac8","amp;dn":"Bartok+-+Solo+Piano+Works+%28Kocsis%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d92c3a21d35cc9a03e025b8c131f3b9bc8a0ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,146,195,162,29,53,204,154,3,224,37,184,193,49,243,185,188,138,10,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
