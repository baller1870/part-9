Lie To Me [0:04:04.72]\n\nOn his two previous Nashville, Tenn.-recorded solo albums, Darius Rucker proved he could gain acceptance from contemporary country music fans. On new album &quot;True Believers,&quot; he proves he can do more than create formulaic radio hits: Finding a country voice and sound of his own, Rucker shows he can leave a distinctive mark on 21st century country music.\n\nWith the funk-country rhythms of &quot;Radio,&quot; &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Lost In You,&quot; he combines the beach-music sound of his native South Carolina with the breezy, catchy side of current Nashville hits. With powerful originals like the roots-rocking &quot;Heartbreak Road&quot; and the raw emotions of &quot;Miss You,&quot; Rucker makes great use of the expressive capabilities of his baritone voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which had been so important to the success of his rock band, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish.\n\nRucker writes 10 of the 12 songs on &quot;True Believers,&quot; yet adds momentum to the collection with two well-chosen songs by others. He faithfully covers Old Crow Medicine Show's Americana hit, &quot;Wagon Wheel,&quot; and nicely handles a duet with Sheryl Crow on &quot;Love Without You,&quot; written by Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally.\n\nAltogether, &quot;True Believers&quot; suggests the 47-year-old has found a home on the country charts where he can settle down for a long spell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ca3d41a332961ced9755c2f47541ca67b4b8f3","amp;dn":"Darius+Rucker+-+True+Believers+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ca3d41a332961ced9755c2f47541ca67b4b8f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,202,61,65,163,50,150,28,237,151,85,194,244,117,65,202,103,180,184,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
