The first issue featured Black Cross on the cover and was notable for the first appearance of Paul Chadwick's Concrete. The title became successful thanks to the increasing popularity of Concrete who quickly became the regular cover feature for much of the first few years of the title.\n\nConcrete eventually spun into its own title and this was something which would happen to several characters and stories appearing in Dark Horse Presents. The most notable of which being Frank Miller's Sin City stories which first appeared in Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special as well as Dark Horse Presents #51.\n\nThe title was Dark Horse's longest running title and provided a mix of material from established and new creators. The title ended with issue 157 in September 2000.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47e0a9071e3df7c6116d26da51fa771ed7cb49b3","amp;dn":"Dark+Horse+Presents+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47e0a9071e3df7c6116d26da51fa771ed7cb49b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,224,169,7,30,61,247,198,17,109,38,218,81,250,119,30,215,203,73,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
