You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.\r\nYou will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base in a harsh environment, where you are always one step away from total failure.\r\nEven if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\r\nFour different planets with different conditions and increasing difficulty.\r\nMine and produce raw resources, process them, manufacture goods, and establish a production chain.\r\nGrow your colony from a few initial pioneers to a vibrant planetbase with hundreds of colonists.\r\nMechanize your base by creating your own bots that will help with the more arduous tasks.\r\nSurvive disasters like meteors, sandstorms or solar flares and defend your base from intruders.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 2 GHz Dual Core \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 512 MB VRAM (Shader Model 3) \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nStorage: 600 MB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18006dada4bca6abae74742e335de3cc48636754","amp;dn":"Planetbase+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18006dada4bca6abae74742e335de3cc48636754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,0,109,173,164,188,166,171,174,116,116,46,51,93,227,204,72,99,103,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
