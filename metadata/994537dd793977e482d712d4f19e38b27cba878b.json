But TormÃƒÂ© picked the songs, ranging from Jerome Kern and P.G. Wodehouse's &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; from 1917 to Duke Ellington and Paul Webster's &quot;I've Got It Bad and That Ain't Good&quot; from 1941.\n \nThe 15-piece orchestra assembled by his accompanist Al Pellegrini backed the singer, and Pellegrini, Sandy Courage, AndrÃƒÂ© Previn, Marty Paich, and Russ Garcia wrote the arrangements. \nTormÃƒÂ© sang with delicate precision, caressing the lyrics. \n\nRecorded and released around the time he turned 30, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It's a Blue WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ marked a turning point in Mel TormÃƒÂ©'s recording career.\nOne of the finest vocal jazz album.\n\n\n\n\nMel TormÃƒÂ©\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Blue World\n\n1955\n\n\n\n  CD / 1995 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n1.
