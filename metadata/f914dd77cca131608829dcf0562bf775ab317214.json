It's great creating maps, analyzing data for land use studies and other reports, and preparing data for use in an application or database. Let Adam Wilbert show you how to display, analyze, and illustrate geospatial data with ArcGIS. He explores how to import data from multiple sources, manage it with the ArcGIS catalog, and then start making maps. Learn how to lay out your data in the ArcMap component; add symbols, scale bars, and legends; and get your maps out of ArcGIS and into the real world, whether it's for printing or export to another application.\nTopics include:\n\n    Understanding vector vs. raster data\n    Modifying metadata\n    Adding data to a map\n    Importing data from online providers\n    Labeling features\n    Joining data\n    Clipping data to a study area\n    Working with map layouts\n    Creating a legend\n    Printing and exporting the map to a file\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f914dd77cca131608829dcf0562bf775ab317214","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Up+and+Running+with+ArcGIS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f914dd77cca131608829dcf0562bf775ab317214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,20,221,119,204,161,49,96,136,41,220,240,86,43,247,117,171,49,114,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
