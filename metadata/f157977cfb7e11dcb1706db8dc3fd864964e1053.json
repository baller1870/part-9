It is another sterling example of the very best Japanese animation has to offer. At its core, this movie is a love letter to classical music and pre-war rural Japan, but is so much more. I&amp;#039;ve often wondered what it would be like if Isao Takahata made a movie like Miyazaki&amp;#039;s My Neighbor Totoro. I think he has.\n\nGauche the Cellist carries a lightwieght, dreamy realism, blessed with the same flights into imagination that brought a mythic romanticism to Anne of Green Gables and later in Omohide Poro Poro. Unlike Miyazaki, who also masterfully fuses fantasy and realism, Takahata&amp;#039;s fantasy sequences have a special intimacy; hallowed moments where you share another person&amp;#039;s heart and soul. It&amp;#039;s intensely personal, and there has never been another filmmaker, animated or otherwise, who does it better.\n\n-- http://www.danielthomas.org/pop/film_reviews/goshu.htm \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f157977cfb7e11dcb1706db8dc3fd864964e1053","amp;dn":"Gauche+The+Cellist+-+1982+DVDrip+Ghibli+%28Sero+Hiki+no+Goshu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f157977cfb7e11dcb1706db8dc3fd864964e1053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,87,151,124,251,126,17,220,177,112,109,184,220,63,216,100,150,78,16,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
