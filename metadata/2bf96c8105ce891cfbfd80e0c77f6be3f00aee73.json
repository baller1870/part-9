Bensalah (InTech, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nTaking into account that corrosion is costly and dangerous phenomenon, it becomes obvious that people engaged in the design and the maintenance of structures and equipment, should have a basic understanding of localized corrosion processes. The Editor hopes that this book will be helpful for researchers in conducting investigations in the field of localized corrosion, as well as for engineers encountering pitting and crevice corrosion, by providing some basic information concerning the causes, prevention, and control of pitting corrosion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf96c8105ce891cfbfd80e0c77f6be3f00aee73","amp;dn":"Pitting+Corrosion+-+N.+Bensalah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf96c8105ce891cfbfd80e0c77f6be3f00aee73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,249,108,129,5,206,137,28,251,253,128,224,199,127,107,227,240,10,238,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
