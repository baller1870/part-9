First, visit Kyoto, where you will discover 1,000 years of history from the ancient love story the Tale of Genji to the traditional tea ceremony. Then head to Tokyo to experience JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cutting-edge capital, where the 21st-century kawaii culture collides with landmarks like the Kabuki-za Theater and the Imperial Palace. For a different perspective, venture outside the city to the seaside towns of Tohoku, the region largely affected by the 2011 tsunami disaster. Written by local expert Sumiki Kajiyama and illustrated in lively animation style, this book introduces readers to JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s national heroes and must-see places from a uniquely Japanese perspective. Informative, entertaining and useful, Cool Japan is an ideal introduction for any traveler looking for a deeper understanding of Japanese culture, past and present.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a563efcc20cad88b1c764ac07edbbbe2c646a05","amp;dn":"Cool+Japan+-+Sumiko+Kajiyama.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a563efcc20cad88b1c764ac07edbbbe2c646a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,86,62,252,194,12,173,136,177,199,100,172,7,237,187,190,44,100,106,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
