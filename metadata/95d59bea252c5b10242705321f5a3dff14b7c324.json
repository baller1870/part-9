I tried to make the translations as literal as possible but if i screwed something up please leave a comment so i know :)\n\nSecond, the image sizes are fairly large and down scaling them to kindle size or smaller may make some of the smaller fonts the original translators used illegible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d59bea252c5b10242705321f5a3dff14b7c324","amp;dn":"Elfen+Lied+-+Full+Manga+-+12+Volumes+-+English+-+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d59bea252c5b10242705321f5a3dff14b7c324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,213,155,234,37,44,91,16,36,39,5,50,31,90,61,255,20,183,195,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
