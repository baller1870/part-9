And in the case of werewolves Anna Latham and Charles Cornick, they mate. The son-and enforcer-of the leader of the North American werewolves, Charles is a dominant alpha. While Anna, an omega, has the rare ability to calm others of her kind. \nNow that the werewolves have revealed themselves to humans, they can't afford any bad publicity. Infractions that could have been overlooked in the past must now be punished, and the strain of doing his father's dirty work is taking a toll on Charles. \nNevertheless, Charles and Anna are sent to Boston, when the FBI requests the pack's help on a local serial killer case. They quickly realize that not only the last two victims were werewolves-all of them were. Someone is targeting their kind. And now Anna and Charles have put themselves right in the killer's sights...\n \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284735260a519ee55506239f4309d79e872d5335","amp;dn":"Patricia+Briggs+-+Fair+Game%2C+%28epub+%2B+mobi%29+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284735260a519ee55506239f4309d79e872d5335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,71,53,38,10,81,158,229,85,6,35,159,67,9,215,158,135,45,83,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
