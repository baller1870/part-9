While it is truly an electric jazz fusion record, it is also the only solo recording of Corea's on which he attempted to truly explore the Latin side of his musical heritage. My Spanish Heart marks a full-scale, yet thoroughly modern, exploration in the musical lineage Corea sprang from. Making full use of synthesizer technology, a string section, and synth-linked choruses -- of two voices, his own and that of Gayle Moran -- as well as percussionist Don Alias, drummer Steve Gadd, a full brass section, and the sparse use of Jean Luc Ponty (&quot;Armando's Rumba&quot;) and bassist Stanley Clark, Corea largely succeeded in creating a Spanish/Latin tapestry of sounds, textures, impressions, and even two suites -- &quot;Spanish Fantasy&quot; and &quot;El Bozo.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\n01 - Love Castle.flac\n02 - The Gardens.flac\n03 - Day Danse.flac\n04 - My Spanish Heart.flac\n05 - Night Streets.flac\n06 - The Hilltop.flac\n07 - The Sky.flac\n08 - Wind Danse.flac\n09 - Armando's Rhumba.flac\n10 - Prelude To El Bozo.flac\n11 - El Bozo, Part I.flac\n12 - El Bozo, Part II.flac\n13 - El Bozo, Part III.flac\n14 - Spanish Fantasy, Part I.flac\n15 - Spanish Fantasy, Part II.flac\n16 - Spanish Fantasy, Part III.flac\n17 - Spanish Fantasy, Part IV.flac\n18 - The Clouds.flac\n\nNMR.
