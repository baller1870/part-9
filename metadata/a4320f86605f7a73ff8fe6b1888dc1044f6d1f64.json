My first \r\nMcCartney since 1990.  Video is pretty \r\ngood.  Seats are very cramped with knees \r\nhitting the rail in front so I had to \r\nreadjust often as you will see.  Good news \r\nis that I was in the middle of the row and \r\nin first row so nobody in fron and no \r\nbathroom people walking in front of me.  \r\nI havent had time to watch and won't because \r\nI have a busy weekend planned and wanted \r\nto post for you all.  Sound is never great \r\nfrom my camera but video is usually pretty \r\ngood.  As always, do whatever you want with \r\nmy videos.  Post them, share them, dub audio, \r\neat them or screw them!  Just tray and enjoy!\r\nMy GF Sue took the pics while I did video so thanks to her!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4320f86605f7a73ff8fe6b1888dc1044f6d1f64","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+2016-08-18+The+Q%2C+Cleveland%2C+Ohio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4320f86605f7a73ff8fe6b1888dc1044f6d1f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,50,15,134,96,95,122,115,255,143,230,177,136,141,193,4,79,109,31,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
