Mostly, we love stories about good men making hard decisions in unforgiving circumstances.\n\nWHY YOU'LL LOVE IT: HIT is a dark crime drama filled with murderers, rapists, and drug lords...and the men who will stop at nothing to bring them to justice. If you're a fan of CRIMINAL, PARKER, and TUMOR, then HIT is the series for you.\n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT: Los Angeles. It's 1955. It's dark; it's sexy. It's dangerous. Everyone has an angle. And while infamous gangster Mickey Cohen rots in a prison cell, Los Angeles ignores the blackest parts of the city's heart...where clandestine groups of LAPD detectives moonlight as sanctioned hitmen knows as &quot;Hit Squads&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6714f28d6acc8a84c9859e325e0418dc840bdd3","amp;dn":"Hit+01+%28of+04%29+%282013%29+%283+Covers%29+%28Digital%29+%28Darkness-Empire%29%28-+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6714f28d6acc8a84c9859e325e0418dc840bdd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,113,79,40,214,172,200,168,76,152,89,227,37,224,65,141,200,64,189,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
