When an apocalyptic event decimates her Louisiana hometown, Evie realizes her hallucinations were actually visions of the futureÃ¢â‚¬â€and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still happening. Fighting for her life and desperate for answers, she must turn to her wrong-side-of-the-bayou classmate: Jack Deveaux.\n\nBut she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do either alone.\n\nWith his mile-long rap sheet, wicked grin, and bad attitude, Jack is like no boy Evie has ever known. Even though he once scorned her and everything she represented, he agrees to protect Evie on her quest. She knows she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t totally depend on Jack. If he ever cast that wicked grin her way, could she possibly resist him?\n\nWho can Evie trust?\n\nAs Jack and Evie race to find the source of her visions, they meet others who have gotten the same call. An ancient prophesy is being played out, and Evie is not the only one with special powers. A group of twenty-two teens has been chosen to reenact the ultimate battle between good and evil.
