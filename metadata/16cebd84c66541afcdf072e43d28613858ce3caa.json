The band's discography has grown to thirty-seven albums, including fifteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.\n\nPioneers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After Death, 1986's Somewhere in Time and 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their latest studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 different countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.\n\nDespite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The New York Times reporting in 2010 that they have sold over 85 million records worldwide.[3] The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, &quot;Eddie&quot;, who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16cebd84c66541afcdf072e43d28613858ce3caa","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+1982-1992+8+Albums%2C+10LP%27s+vinylrip+24bit-192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16cebd84c66541afcdf072e43d28613858ce3caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,206,189,132,198,101,65,175,205,240,114,228,61,40,97,56,88,206,60,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
