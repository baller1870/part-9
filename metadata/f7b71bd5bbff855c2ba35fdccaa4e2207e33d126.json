The group comprises four Northern Irish members; Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Nathan Connolly (guitar, backing vocals), Jonny Quinn (drums), Johnny McDaid (piano, guitar, backing vocals), and Scottish member Paul Wilson (bass guitar, backing vocals). Initially an indie rock band, their first three records, the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997), and the studio albums Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent labels Electric Honey and Jeepster. The band signed on to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.\n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998-2011\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded:............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n1998 - Songs For Polarbears\n\n2001 - When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up (2006 Reissue)\n\n2003 - Final Straw\n\n2006 - Eyes Open (Special Edition)\n\n2008 - A Hundred Million Suns\n\n2009 - Up To Now\n\n2011 - Fallen Empires\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b71bd5bbff855c2ba35fdccaa4e2207e33d126","amp;dn":"Snow+Patrol+-+Discography+%281998-2011%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7b71bd5bbff855c2ba35fdccaa4e2207e33d126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,183,27,213,187,255,133,92,43,163,95,220,202,164,226,32,126,51,209,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
