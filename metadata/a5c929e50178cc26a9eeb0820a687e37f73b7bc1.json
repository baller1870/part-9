It presents a unique libertarian view of morality, government, society, and human nature. Part I identifies the mental traps that are so easy to fall into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ traps that prevent you from being as free as you could be. Part II provides specific techniques you can use today to obtain greater freedom from government, from societal restrictions, and from business, personal, and family problems. Part III shows how to make necessary changes to a freer life right now.\n\nWhile Harry waited and hoped for a free society, he made sure that his own life was as free and happy as possible. Using the same libertarian principles that would underlie a free society, he created a successful and joyous life for himself and his family. He put these principles and techniques into his book, How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World. In the book youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find ways to obtain greater freedom from government, freedom from social restrictions, freedom from business problems, personal problems, family problems, and freedom from the treadmill.\n\nHow I Found Freedom in an Unfree World will not only put you on the path to a freer, happier life, it will inspire almost anyone to take greater responsibility for his own life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to quit focusing on the shortcomings of others and use the sovereignty one does have to take control of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own life and make the most of it. How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World can make your life much freer and happier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c929e50178cc26a9eeb0820a687e37f73b7bc1","amp;dn":"How+I+Found+Freedom+In+An+Unfree+World+By+Harry+Browne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c929e50178cc26a9eeb0820a687e37f73b7bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,201,41,229,1,120,204,38,169,238,176,130,10,104,126,55,247,59,123,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
