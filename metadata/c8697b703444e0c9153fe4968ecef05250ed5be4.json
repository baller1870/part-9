The cuts Papa Won't Leave You Henry, I Had A Dream Joe, and Brother My Cup Is Empty get the adrenaline pumping. When I First Came To Town is a melancholy ballad that whispers darkly of rejection and of revenge to come. John Finn's Wife is a tense and sexy story. Of the two romantic songs on the CD, The Loom of the Land is the most haunting. But the romantic feeling it engenders is suddenly dashed as the album closes with the anti-romantic Jack the Ripper. It is deep, it is wild, and it is sheer insanity. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 14\nArtist: Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds\nAlbum: Henry's Dream\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8697b703444e0c9153fe4968ecef05250ed5be4","amp;dn":"Nick+Cave+-+Henry%5C%27s+Dream+%5BFLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8697b703444e0c9153fe4968ecef05250ed5be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,105,123,112,52,68,224,201,21,63,228,150,142,206,240,82,80,237,91,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
