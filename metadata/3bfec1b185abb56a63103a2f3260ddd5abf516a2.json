The boy who fell for the emotional resonance of bone-disintegrating sub-bass only after years of playing piano privately came out against the American version of guys like Skrillex (whom he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even be bothered naming). Such performers, Blake contended, appealed strictly to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“testosterone-driven, frat-boy marketÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be more different from the Feist-and-Joni covers and Bon Iver duets pouring out of the Londoner whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just turned 23. Blake argued that his music was not only more egalitarian-- appealing to women and men equally-- but was also a purer representation of dubstep as an idea. It was a misrepresentation of American dubstepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s audiences and a presumptuous statement about What Women Want, sure, but at the same time, it was hard to fault Blake for forcefully trying to stake his claim to a patch of land within a genre broad enough to incorporate a rave resurgence and a brooding folkie.\nBy Eric Harvey\nFull Review: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17842-james-blake-overgrown/\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Electronica, post-dubstep, soul\nQuality: FLAC/tracks+.cue\n\nTracklist:\n01.
