On the other hand, modern construction economics has a wider focus with stronger links to mainstream economics, reflecting an increased interest in a range of theoretical issues in construction economics, both at the macro and micro level. In Modern Construction Economics: Theory and Application, a variety of approaches are used to present a coherent vision of synthesis between industry economics and project economics. ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€šÂ¬\n\nTopics covered include:\n\n    * developing construction economics as idustry economics\n    * competition and barriers to entry in construction\n    * innovation in construction\n    * theory testing in construction management research\n    * collusion and corruption in the construction sector.\n\nIncluding contributions from academics in the UK, Sweden, Hong Kong, and Australia, this is a truly global review of a core issue for the construction industry worldwide. The result is a unique book that will push toward the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework of construction economics. This is a must-read for all serious students of construction economics, and all practitioners looking for a deeper understanding of their industry.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGerard de Valence teaches in the undergraduate and postgraduate construction and property courses in the School of the Built Environment at the University of Technology, Sydney.
