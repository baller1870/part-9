As described by Sackett and colleagues ( Evidence-Based Medicine: How to Practice and Teach EBM , 2nd ed, London, 2000, Harcourt Publishers Limited), evidence-based practice is a combination of three elements: the best available evidence, clinical experience, and patient values. Sackett has further reported that Ã¢â‚¬Å“when these three elements are integrated, clinicians and patients form a diagnostic and therapeutic alliance which optimizes clinical outcomes and quality of life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Each element contributes signifi cantly to the clinical reasoning process by helping to identify a diagnosis or prognosis or establish an eff ective and effi cient plan of care. Unfortunately, the evidence-based approach confronts a number of barriers that may limit the clinicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to utilize the best available evidence to guide decisions about patient care, most signifi cantly a lack of time and resources. Given the increasing prevalence of new clinical tests in the orthopaedic setting and the frequent omission from textbooks of information about their diagnostic utility, the need was clear for a quick reference guide for students and busy clinicians that would enhance their ability to incorporate evidence into clinical decision making.\n\nThe purpose of NetterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Orthopaedic Clinical Examination: An Evidence Based Approach is twofold: to serve as a textbook for musculoskeletal evaluation courses in an academic setting and to provide a quick, user-friendly guide and reference for clinicians who want to locate the evidence related to the diagnostic utility of commonly utilized tests and measures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb398eb6520e804cb6bd1012db3420295991372","amp;dn":"Cleland+2011+Netter+Orthopaedic+Clinical+Examination+2nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb398eb6520e804cb6bd1012db3420295991372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,179,152,235,101,32,232,4,203,107,209,1,45,179,66,2,149,153,19,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
