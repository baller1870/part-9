The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist and backing vocalist Alex Lifeson, and drummer, percussionist, and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through several re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first United States tour.\n\nSince the release of the band's self-titled debut album in March 1974, Rush has become known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. Rush's music style has changed over the years beginning with blues-inspired heavy metal, then encompassing progressive rock and a period with heavy use of synthesizers. Their musical style returned to a more guitar-oriented sound in 1989.[1] Their latest studio album, Clockwork Angels (2012) won the Album Of The Year Award from Progressive Music Awards.[2] The supporting tour ran from September 2012 to August 2013.\n\nAccording to the RIAA Rush ranks 80th with sales of 25 million units in the United States.[3] Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, several industry sources estimated Rush's total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units as of 2004. The group has been awarded 24 gold, 14 platinum, and 3 multi-platinum albums.[4]\n\nRush has received seven Grammy award nominations, although they have never won a Grammy.[5] However, the band has gone on to win several Juno Awards, was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994, and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.[6][7] Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls.\n\nAlbumlist:\n1976 - All The World's A Stage (US Mercury Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SRM-2-7508)[Vinyl 24-192]\n1976- 2112 (UK Mercury 9100 03) [VINYL 24-192]\n1978 - Archives 3 first albums(US, Mercury Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SRM-3-9200 ) [VINYL 24-192]\n1978 - Hemispheres (Japan, Epic 25Ã¢â‚¬Â¢3P-269 )  [VINYL 24-192]\n1978 - Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI, 12.01.78\n1980 - Permanent Waves (Japan, Epic,  25Ã¢â‚¬Â¢3P-221)[VINYL 24-192]\n1981  - Moving Pictures (South Korea, Mercury 8207-L4663-9) [VINYL 24-192]\n1981 - Exit...Stage Left (US, Mercury  6337 194-5) [VINYL 24-192]\n1982 - Signals (Japan, Epic  25Ã¢â‚¬Â¢3P-378)[VINYL 24-192]\n1984 - Grace Under Pressure (Japan Epic-Sony Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 25 3P-505)[VINYL 24-192]\n1985 - Power Windows (US, 422 826 098-1 M-1)[VINYL 24-96]\n1987 - Hold Your Fire (Japan, Epic-Sony 28.3P-847)[VINYL 24-192]\n1989 -  Presto  (ANL 1059 , Canada)[VINYL 24-192]\n1991 - Roll The Bones (Europe Atlantic Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7567-82293-1 ) [Vinyl 24-96]\n2004 - Feedback (US, Atlantic 83728-1) [VINYL 24-96]\n2007- Snakes &amp; Arrows (US, Atlantic Ã¢â‚¬Å½Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 177084 )[VINYL 24-96]\n2012 - Clockwork Angels ( US, Roadrunner Records) [Digital 24-96]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b152c50b38797ac1af3f2092220470d0547f04","amp;dn":"Rush+Vinyl+19+Albums+1974-2012+24bit%2F96+%26amp%3B+24bit%2F192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b152c50b38797ac1af3f2092220470d0547f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,177,82,197,11,56,121,122,193,175,63,32,146,34,4,112,208,84,127,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
