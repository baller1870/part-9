Five singles were released from the album: &quot;The Day I Tried to Live&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot;, &quot;Spoonman&quot;, and &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, the latter two of which won Grammy Awards and helped Soundgarden reach mainstream popularity. In 1995, the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. The album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA in the United States and has sold around 9 million copies worldwide and remains Soundgarden's most successful album.
