I won't bring out the hyperboles when others have written with greater knowledge and style on the Duke, but I do want to focus on one of the exemplary tracks on the disc: 'Going Up', which is a real beauty, a shimmeringly clear classic of progressive jazz movement. From this tiny claw one could hypothetically infer the lion (that is the Duke). The recording has a great wide sound, simple stereo; great virtuoso flute riff-tripping and striding buoyant bass. The track has got it all, simple structure hiding a nicely complex call and response, subtle behind-the-scenes leadership with a dexterous piano lead: very active and involved (even by Duke's standards), very on top of it knowing everyone is &quot;on&quot;, and almost every other solo ends on a refrain. Real working-band stuff, intimate yet professional. Great interplay with a slightly tensed-chorus and relaxed and loosed-up solos. And plenty of space in the middle of the mix to lend it all an air of clean abstraction - just the ride cymbal with the bass below it, and all them horns in wide stereo, an exercise in group swing genius. There is so much familiarity and bright ease in the whole movement that you get a taste of the power of the Duke at work. ~ Rino Breebaart\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 04 - Duke Ellington Tracks:\n01  Take The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Train 2:55\n02  La Plus Belle Africaine 13:58 \n03  Flirtibird 3:05 \n04  Diminuendo In Blue And Blow By Blow 7:39\n05  Loveless Love 7:08\n06  Going Up 4:53 \n07  St. Louis Blues 5:46\n08  Stompy Jones 6:41\n09  Caravan 3:55 \n10  Total Jazz 3:26 \n11  Perdido 4:37\n12  Jam With Sam 4:09\n13  RockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ In Rhythm 4:14 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5501f4d30f64eac2dfd2a51dc8d690dd2c289f44","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+04+-+Duke+Ellington+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160%5D%5Bh3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5501f4d30f64eac2dfd2a51dc8d690dd2c289f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,1,244,211,15,100,234,194,223,210,165,29,200,214,144,221,44,40,159,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
