Now a race begins between computers (HAL) and man (Bowman) to reach the monolith-placers, the winner will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be. \n\n\n\n\n A Clockwork Orange (1971)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Thriller\nUser Rating: 8.5/10 (139,582 votes)\nTop 250: #50\n\nRelease Date: 2 February 1972\nCountry: UK\nLanguage: English\nCompany: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nCast: \nMalcolm McDowell ... Alex\nPatrick Magee ... Mr. Alexander\nMichael Bates ... Chief Guard\nWarren Clarke ... Dim\nJohn Clive ... Stage Actor\nAdrienne Corri ... Mrs. Alexander\nCarl Duering ... Dr. Brodsky\nPaul Farrell ... Tramp\nClive Francis ... Lodger\n\nPlot: Stomping, whomping, stealing, singing, tap-dancing, violating, Derby-topped teddy-boy hooligan Alex has his own way of having a good time. He has it at the tragic expense of others. Alex&amp;#039;s journey from amoral punk to brainwashed proper citizen forms the dynamic arc of Stanley Kubrick&amp;#039;s future-shook vision of Anthony Burgess&amp;#039;s novel. Unforgettable images, startling musical counterpoints, the fascinating language used by Alex and his pals - Kubrick shapes them into a shattering whole. Hugely controversial when first released, A Clockwork Orange won the New York Film Critics Best Picture and Director honors and earned four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The power of its art is such that it still entices, shocks, and holds us in its grasp.\n\n\n\n Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\nGenre: Comedy | Drama\nUser Rating: 8.7/10 (119,997 votes)\nTop 250: #24\n\nRelease Date: 29 January 1964 (USA)\nCountry: UK\nLanguage: English  | Russian\nCompany: Hawk Films\n\nCast: \nPeter Sellers ...

The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot; which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Premier and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that &quot;such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious&quot;. Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world ?\n\n\n\n Eyes Wide Shut (1999)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\nGenre: Drama | Mystery | Thriller\nUser Rating: 7.1/10 (70,970 votes)\nRelease Date: 16 July 1999\nCountry: UK  | USA\nLanguage: English\nCompany: Hobby Films\n\nCast: \nTom Cruise ...

The result of this amazing film has been the emergence of one of the great talents in contemporary cinema, the master whose greatest work was yet to come.\n\n\n\n Spartacus (1960)\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\nGenre: Action | Adventure\nUser Rating: 8.0/10 (36,266 votes)\nTop 250: #209\n\nRelease Date: 7 October 1960\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nCompany: Bryna Productions\n\nCast: \nKirk Douglas ...
