The record company, which had formed in 1982, had achieved modest success with Dance-themed multi-artist compilation albums with notable successes in the genre including the Dance Mix collections of 1987 and 1988 and The Best Of House '88. What was initially unique about the Deep Heat collections was that they contained exclusive 12&quot; Remixes of recent Club Hits, instead of Extended versions of Chart Hits featured on similar collections such as Now Dance 89 which was charting around the same time as the first Deep Heat albums. The success of the series was partly due to the CD boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s and it was the first time full 12&quot; Mixes could be commercially bought on Compact Disc. Tracks on the first and longest running release kicked-off with Adeva 's version of 'Respect' while Underground favourites such as 'Break 4 Luv' by Raze and Hithouse's 'Jack To The Sound Of The Underground (Acid Mix)' ensured the album reached the top of the newly created Compilation Chart, the first of many.\n\nDuring 1989, Telstar saw each of their 5 Deep Heat compilations reach the Compilation Top 5, the first four peaked at either #1 or #2, all gaining Gold BPI Awards for UK sales over 250,000. The December release Fight The Flame collected the biggest hits of the year and became one of Telstar's four Platinum selling albums of 1989. An influx of similar releases appeared on rival labels, including Stylus collections, The Right Stuff ~ Remix 89 and Where's The House? who also teamed up with another rival K-Tel for Hip House ~ The Deepest Beats in Town. Both companies had disappeared by the end of 1990.\n\nAn interesting addition to Telstar's marketing of the Deep Heat series was the release of a Megamix of the biggest hits from two albums; Feed The Fever and The Sixth Sense. This was the first time the Megamix had been used to promote a Compilation series.\n\n\nAlso unique to the Deep Heat Compilations was that there would often be 'Exclusive Remixes' of tracks, such as the previously mentioned Megamix of Technotronic's biggest hits. This appeared on Deep Heat 7 ~ Seventh Heaven several months before it was commercially released, while &quot;Exclusive Deep Heat Mix&quot;s of tracks by The KLF featured on later editions.\n\nThe packaging of each album was also a factor of the album's popularity, with often a striking design gracing the front and interior packaging. Earlier themes revolved around fire, heat, flames, temperatures and burning - metaphorically suggesting the tracks will make the dancefloor burn (an idea used again later with the Megabass track.) Later releases, such as Deep Heat 6 ~ The Sixth Sense used mystic symbols as a theme; Deep Heat 7 ~ Seventh Heaven cools down the collection with heavenly blue skies and Angelic artwork; Deep Heat 9 ~ Ninth Life Kiss The Bliss features Egyptian monuments praising heavenly skies and Deep Heat 10 ~ The Awakening contains graphics of an alien being.
