Palmer is backed by The Meters and Lowell George of Little Feat. Multiple reviewers have commented that Robert sings confidently on this album despite being backed by more accomplishedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“at the timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“musicians such as Lowell George, Art Neville and New Orleans singer-songwriter Allen Toussaint.Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley is funky, blue-eyed soul as opposed to the slicker pop music that Robert created in the 1980's.\n\nThe title song &quot;Sneakin' Sally Through The Alley&quot; was covered by the jam band Phish.\n\n\nReview\tby Vik Iyengar\n\nBefore becoming a slick, sharp-dressed pop star in the 1980s, Robert Palmer was a soul singer deeply rooted in R&amp;B and funk. Those influences are on full display on his debut album Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley. With a backing band including members of Little Feat and the Meters, the music has a laid-back groove whether Palmer's covering New Orleans legend Allen Toussaint (the title track) or singing originals (&quot;Hey Julia,&quot; &quot; Get Outside&quot;). While the music is tight and solid, it is Robert Palmer's voice that is revelatory -- he sounds supremely confident among these talented musicians, and they seem to feed off his vocal intensity. Fans of the Meters or people who want to discover the funky side of Robert Palmer should check this one out. \n\n\n\n\n1. (02:42) - Sailing Shoes\n2. (02:25) - Hey Julia\n3.
