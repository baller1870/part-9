Time to update your library. This is some laid back listening of real music from a gifted artist. - Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nBy Amanda Richards VINE VOICE\n\n\nA die-hard Neil Diamond fan might like this album from the first listen, but for younger music fans it may take a few repeats to get into it. The simplicity of the man singing to the accompaniment of a guitar might seem quite unusual in this era of loud backing music, but this is Neil Diamond, one of the few who can carry it off in style.\n\nThis is a slow, laid-back Sunday afternoon sort of album, with some of the tracks sounding like vintage Diamond of the &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; and &quot;Song Sung Blue&quot; era.\n\nSongs to take note of are &quot;Evermore&quot;, &quot;Delirious Love&quot;, &quot;Hell Yeah&quot;, &quot;What's It Gonna Be&quot; and &quot;Captain of a Shipwreck.&quot;\n\nWith this album, we can almost forgive him for that awful rendition of &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer&quot;, but unfortunately it will probably be best remembered as one of the last of the infamous Sony spyware discs, and that would be doing the album a great disservice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aceb5957afa9d2e2fa4def698d8b128c8e26532","amp;dn":"Neil+Diamond+-+12+Songs+%2B+2+Bonus+Tracks+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aceb5957afa9d2e2fa4def698d8b128c8e26532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,206,181,149,122,250,157,46,47,164,222,246,152,216,177,40,200,226,101,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
