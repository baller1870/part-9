Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution:\n                   Modern Physics for Non-Scientists.\n\nDescription\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEinstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Non-Scientists\n(24 lectures, 30 minutes/lecture). Taught by Richard Wolfson, Dartmouth College.\n   \nNoww you can learn the basic ideas behind the theory of relativity and quantum physics from 24 lectures that require no special background in math or science. \n\nProfessor Richard Wolfson teaches the awe-inspiringÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹and even, at times, mind-bendingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹concepts of modern physics in ways that anyone interested in learning can readily master.\n\nWith scientists perhaps on the verge of unlocking the deepest secrets of the universe and with breaking news of discovery after discovery, an understanding of this fascinating subject has never been so important.\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles:\n01. Time Travel, Tunneling, Tennis, and Tea \n02. Heaven and Earth, Place and Motion \n03. The Clockwork Universe \n04. Let There Be Light! \n05. Speed c Relative to What? \n06. Earth and the EtherÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹A Crisis in Physics \n07. Einstein to the Rescue \n08. Uncommon SenseÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹Stretching Time \n09. Muons and TimeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹Traveling Twins \n10. Escaping Contradiction-Simultaneity Is Relative \n11. Faster than Light? Past, Future, and Elsewhere \n12. What about E=mc2, and Is Everything Relative? \n13. A Problem of Gravity \n14. Curved Spacetime \n15. Black Holes \n16. Into the Heart of Matter \n17. Enter the Quantum \n18. Wave or Particle? \n19. Quantum UncertaintyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹Farewell to Determinism \n20.
