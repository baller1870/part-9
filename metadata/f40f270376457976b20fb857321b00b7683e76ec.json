They get a bank to issue a one million pound note (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1,000,000), which they present to Adams in an envelope (only telling him that it contains some money). Oliver believes that the mere existence of the note will enable the possessor to obtain whatever he needs, while Roderick contends that it would actually have to be spent for it to be of any use.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f40f270376457976b20fb857321b00b7683e76ec","amp;dn":"The+Million+Pound+Note","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f40f270376457976b20fb857321b00b7683e76ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,15,39,3,118,69,121,118,178,15,184,87,50,27,0,183,104,62,118,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
