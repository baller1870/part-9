It is remarkable with terrific tracks and a seemingly natural flowing feel about it. From the opening track, you are transported to Brazil and have the feel of the music and the inspiration of the new movement and the next generation of Brazilian musicians and stars.\nThe biggest standout track to me is Joyce's &quot;Aldeia de Ogum&quot;. It displays her range and the shows how she could use her voice as an instrument just like the other top divas of Sarah Vaugh and Flora Purim. Other notable artists were Edu Lobo, Marcos Valle, Eumir Deodoto and Milton Banana Trio. \n\nAfter giving it a listen, you wonder why Sergio Mendes version of Ponteio wasn't included. But it doesn't stop you from enjoying it. I recommend this CD. ~ bordersj2\n\nTo talk about Brazil is to evoke the musical paradise per excellence, the untiring joy, the delirious football, its dreamy beaches, its eternal sun. that successful cornucopia has allowed to nourish an intense musicality as well musical styles, including Joven Guarda in the 50?s, samba and MPB in the 60's and 70's. That impressive crossroads of cultures; European, African and Indian. Furthermore, Brazil has inspired the jazz and vice versa with fabulous results. \n\nThis album incorporates a very valuable set of singers, ensembles between 1965 and 1980, and it constitutes an admirable tour de force throughout the Brazilian music: Quarteto Novo, Joyce, Milton banana Trio, Eumir Deodato and the delirious singer Elza Soares \n\nIf you go for this album, you will make a wise choice. ~ Hiram Gomez Pardo\n\nThis inspiring, romp of an album never let's up! The corny cover of a Carmen Miranda with fruit bowl hat is not a good indication of the quality of the music which is seriously brilliant (and there are no Carmen Miranda songs). Joyce's dazzling, virtuosic, &quot;Aldea de ogum&quot; is a standout track but this collection of rare material from the 1960s to the 1990s is remarkable for its consistent high quality. &quot;Blue Brazil&quot; belongs with other essential Brazilian compilation CDs like &quot;Canta Brazil -The Great Brazilian Songbook&quot; and &quot;Beleza Tropical 1&quot;. ~ Jeff Burgess\n\nVA - Blue Brazil Vol 1: Blue Note in a Latin Groove Tracks:\n01  Luiz Arruda Paez - Upa Neguinho 2:36\n02  Alaide Costa - Catavento 2:42\n03  Mandrake Som - Berimbau 4:06\n04  Quarteto Novo - Vim De Santana 5:13\n05  Perry Ribiero / Bossa 3 - Deus Brasiliero 1:55\n06  Milton Banana Trio - Primitivo 2:41\n07  Milton Banana Trio - Noa Noa 1:59\n08  Edu Lobo - Viola Fora De Moda 2:51\n09  Bossa 3 - Nao Me Diga Adeus 3:33\n10  Marcos Valle - Batucada Sergiu 2:18\n11  Joyce - Aldeia De Ogum 4:35\n12  Lo Borges - Tudo Que Voce Podia Ser 3:48\n13  Som TrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªs - Homenagem A Mongo 4:23\n14  Elza Soares - Deixa Isso Pra La 2:31\n15  Quarteto Novo - Misturada 4:19\n16  Eumir Deodato - Bebe 2:31\n17  Johnny Alf Um Tema P'ro Simon 3:09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1545f66c8e11d664afefde71fae0f3d09477df71","amp;dn":"VA+-+Blue+Brazil+Vol+1%3A+Blue+Note+in+a+Latin+Groove+%281994%29+%5BBoss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1545f66c8e11d664afefde71fae0f3d09477df71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,69,246,108,142,17,214,100,175,239,222,113,250,224,243,208,148,119,223,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
