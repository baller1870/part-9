And after Cate's friend Sachi is arrested for using magic, a war-thirsty Sister offers to help her find answersÃ¢â‚¬â€if Cate is willing to endanger everyone she loves.\n\nCate doesn't want to be a weapon, and she doesn't want to involve her friends and Finn in the Sisterhood's schemes. But when Maura and Tess join the Sisterhood, Maura makes it clear that she'll do whatever it takes to lead the witches to victory. Even if it means sacrifices. Even if it means overthrowing Cate. Even if it means all-out war.\n\nIn the highly anticipated sequel to Born Wicked, the Cahill Witch Chronicles continue Cate, Maura and Tess's quest to find love, protect family, and explore their magic against all odds in an alternate history of New England.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046c9f47e02fdfae1a8d6ef2f16d6524769b003c","amp;dn":"Star+Cursed+by+Jessica+Spotswood.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046c9f47e02fdfae1a8d6ef2f16d6524769b003c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,108,159,71,224,47,223,174,26,141,110,242,241,109,101,36,118,155,0,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
