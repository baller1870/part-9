GameplayKit\r\nfocuses on mechanics, not visuals, offering randomization\r\nentities, artificial intelligence, pathfinding, and more\r\nIt's about programming the actions that make gameplay\r\ndynamic and exciting. Join Tammy Coron in this course, as\r\nshe shows how to use these new features to take your iOS\r\nand OS X games to the next level. She shows how to\r\nintroduce random sources and distributions, create reusable\r\ngame entities; transition between states such as walking\r\nand running with state machines; develop realistic\r\nopponents with artificial intelligence; use pathfinding and\r\nagents to move players around; and build complex game logic\r\nwith rules systems. By the end, you'll have a better\r\nunderstanding of how to use only the parts of GameplayKit\r\nyou need to build more realistic and believable games\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n* What is GameplayKit?\r\n\r\n* Working with random sources and distributions\r\n\r\n* Adding randomization to games\r\n\r\n* Working with entities and components\r\n\r\n* Defining and creating states and behaviors\r\n\r\n* Designing a game for AI\r\n\r\n* Adding pathfinding to avoid obstacles\r\n\r\n* Using the agent system to manage player movement\r\n\r\n* Creating a simple rules system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0289129abe1cb0f1ea78a54839b08c53df60c7d","amp;dn":"Lynda+Programming+iOS+9+And+Gameplaykit+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0289129abe1cb0f1ea78a54839b08c53df60c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,40,145,41,171,225,203,15,30,167,138,84,131,155,8,197,61,246,12,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
