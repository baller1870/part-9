Meier introduces Agile ResultsÃ‚Â®-a simple system for meaningful results! It's a systematic way to achieve both short- and long-term results in all aspects of your life-from work to fun. It offers just enough planning to get you going, but makes it easy to change your course as needed. It also provides fresh starts for your day, week, month, and year. Even if you already use another time management system, Agile Results can supplement it to increase your impact and sense of fulfillment. In today's world, change happens quickly; learn how to be flexible and responsive to new opportunities. Don't just check off tons of stuff from your to-do list; do the things that make a difference. Stop trudging your way through life; bolster your energy with habits that will carry you forward each day. Quit sacrificing your personal life for your work life (or vice versa); give each facet of your life its due and find balance. In other words, learn the skills to go the distance in an ever-changing world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fa69ebfcf9030f6fb42ce9262d9c913650d188","amp;dn":"Getting+Results+the+Agile+Way%3A+A+Personal+Results+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fa69ebfcf9030f6fb42ce9262d9c913650d188","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,250,105,235,252,249,3,15,111,180,44,233,38,45,156,145,54,80,209,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
