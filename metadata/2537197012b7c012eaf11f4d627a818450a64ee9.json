The band has released three different demo tapes, followed by the 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hidden DangersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on SMP Records including the two songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“KathedralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hidden Danger (In the Night)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. If you listen to In SolitudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brand of complex, high-class heavy metal with high-pitched singing, one band springs to your mind immediately: Mercyful Fate. After the demo tapes and the 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ single, In Solitude have taken the next logical step in releasing a full-length album. The vinyl version was released by High Roller Records, the CD came out via Pure Steel Records.\n\nIN SOLITUDE signed a worldwide deal with Metal Blade Records in 2010. This is also the year that Henrik Palm, vocalist and guitarist for the heavy punkers Sonic Ritual, passed the trials by fire and thus a new fury rose within the horde. The cultivation of a new sound nears perfection; one that bears the dynamic powers of youth and the embittered wisdom of the ages.\n\nThe World.The Flesh.The Devil was released to worldwide praise from press and fans alike and landed at the #4 spot on Decibel Magazine's Top 40 Extreme Albums of 2011. Additional accolades were heaped onto the album from Terrorizer Magazine, who called the album &quot;finely crafted, occult-oriented, melodic heavy metal of the highest order&quot;, as well as Guitar World Magazine who claim that &quot;On their sophomore album, Sweden's retro-minded metallers In Solitude summon the dark essence of Mercyful Fate and the two-guitar attack of Iron Maiden.\n\n&quot;Sister&quot; was recorded at Studio Cobra in Stockholm, Sweden during March 2013. The album was produced and mixed by Martin &quot;Konie&quot; Ehrencrona and stands as a logical next step above and beyond its predecessor, &quot;The World.The Flesh.The Devil.&quot; In Solitude's strength resides in their ability to craft dark and oppressive atmospheres within the auditory realm of classic heavy metal.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nGottfrid Ãƒâ€¦hman (Bass)\nUno Bruniusson (Drums)\nNiklas LindstrÃƒÂ¶m (Lead Guitar)\nPelle Ãƒâ€¦hman (Vocals)\nHenrik Palm (Guitar)\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
