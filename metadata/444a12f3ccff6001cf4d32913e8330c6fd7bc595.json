The original production was considered quite daring in its attitudes towards homosexuality (both actual and alleged) and marital infidelity; the film softpedals these elements, as much by adding to the text as by subtracting from it. John Kerr plays a sensitive college student who prefers the arts to sports; as such, he is ridiculed as a &quot;sissy&quot; by his classmates and hounded mercilessly by his macho-obsessed father Edward Andrews. Only student Darryl Hickman treats Kerr with any decency, perceiving that being different is not the same as being effeminate. Deborah Kerr, the wife of testosterone-driven housemaster Leif Erickson, likewise does her best to understand rather than condemn John for his &quot;strangeness.&quot; Desperate to prove his manhood, John is about to visit town trollop Norma Crane. Though nothing really happens, the girl cries &quot;rape!&quot; Both John's father and Deborah's husband adopt a thick-eared &quot;Boys will be boys&quot; attitude, which only exacerbates John's insecurities. Feeling pity for John and at the same time resenting her own husband's boorishness, Deborah offers her own body to the mixed-up boy. &quot;When you speak of this in future years...and you will...be kind.&quot; With this classic closing line, the original stage production of Tea and Sympathy came to an end. Fearing censorship interference, MGM insisted upon a stupid epilogue, indicating that Deborah Kerr deeply regretted her &quot;wrong&quot; behavior.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049829/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049829/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-34696&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-34696&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nVideo]\nResolution : 720x304\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1519 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,30 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444a12f3ccff6001cf4d32913e8330c6fd7bc595","amp;dn":"Tea+and+Sympathy+%281956%29+Deborah+Kerr%2C+John+Kerr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444a12f3ccff6001cf4d32913e8330c6fd7bc595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,74,18,243,204,255,96,1,207,77,50,145,62,131,48,198,253,123,197,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
