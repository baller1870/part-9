You can get a good idea what it's about by reading the blurb for 'Super Villains'. \n\n\n'Encyclopedia of Super Villains'\nFacts On File Publications, 1987, 459 pages\nWritten by Jeff Rovin\n\nThis lavishly illustrated companion to Rovin's The Encyclopedia of Superheroes (1985) contains short articles on almost 1000 villainous characters culled from movies, TV, mythology, fiction, and other sources. The majority of those featured are outlandish characters from comic books. Villains from genre fiction such as mysteries, science fiction, or romances are almost nonexistent, as are the classic villains of literature, folklore, and mainstream movies. Most of the selected villains apparently were included because of their noteworthy nastiness and the audacity of their criminal intentions. This is a well-researched, well-written, amply illustrated dictionary for an area where there are few reliable reference sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4978f5d630c7bcd2fc73be9eccb824d7f2cc1e0c","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Superheroes+and+Super+Villains","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4978f5d630c7bcd2fc73be9eccb824d7f2cc1e0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,120,245,214,48,199,188,210,252,115,190,158,204,184,36,215,242,204,30,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
