Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those '80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera's mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new album debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; was getting massive airplay.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Ride My Rocket\n02.I'll Be Allright\n03.Tell Me If You Want It\n04.Latest Lover\n05.Biggest Part Of Me\n06.Down Below\n07.Death Trap\n08.Nothin' On (But The Radio)\n09.Sad Lover\n10.Rock Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa00a488949c9eb43ad7ef4749bd4a4dc813dd3","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+Metal+Magic+%281983%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa00a488949c9eb43ad7ef4749bd4a4dc813dd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,160,10,72,137,73,201,235,67,173,126,244,116,155,212,164,220,129,61,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
