I can not convey enough how risky and brilliant this is. From obscure tracks like Fallen to the more familiar (Case of You, Hallelujah) she studies the song and plants her thumb firmly on the core. And not in a &quot;studied&quot; way, but in a literate, passionate, loving way. To say she takes Case of You to astral heights is not granting it full due. I have never heard a Joni Mitchell cover taken so gently in one's hands, yet experienced so fully. Her voice was made for songs such as these.\n\nAnd I can not serve Love is Everything properly, you simply must hear it's melancholic words and her treatment to know what that heartbreak feels like.\n\nThis album touches me in ways, subtle, longing, and sweet that few albums have. And k.d. deserves much credit for challenging herself and her audience with such art.
