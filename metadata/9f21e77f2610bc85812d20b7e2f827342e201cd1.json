She's so driven she runs for Congress to advance the cause of education reform. Hannah's not a likable candidate, though; her elitism turns off Boston voters, big-time. Hannah and her business partner, Colleen Pickering (Camryn Manheim) don't give up easily. Next election, they recruit a candidate - beer vendor Elliot Doolittle (David Walton) - who definitely is a man-of-the-people. Elliot - whose thick South Boston accent masks considerable intelligence - is the polar opposite of prim-and-proper Hannah. But as Elliot becomes more &quot;presentable&quot; and Hannah becomes less &quot;proper,&quot; could this be a match made in electoral Heaven?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f21e77f2610bc85812d20b7e2f827342e201cd1","amp;dn":"The+Makeover+2013+Hallmark+720p+HDTV+X264+Solar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f21e77f2610bc85812d20b7e2f827342e201cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,33,231,127,38,16,188,133,129,45,32,183,226,248,39,52,46,32,28,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
