This is not only the history of an amazing art form, it is also the adventure of one century and a half during which photography has captured the image of the collective conscience.\n\nOver four hours long, this trip is as dazzling as it is moving, where one crosses paths with such celebrated photographers as Ansel Adams, Brassai, Lewis Carroll, Robert Doisneau, George Eastman, Max Ernst, Roger Fenton, Eadweard Muybridge, Helmut Newton, Nicephore Niepce, Man Ray, Edward J. Steichen, Alfred Stieglitz, Andy Warhol, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and many more.\n\n# Disc One The Precursors\n# The Surrealists\n# War Photography\n# Portraitists\n# The Photoreporters\n# Fashion Photography\n\nDisc Two\n# Nudes\n# Photography and Science\n# Amateur Photography\n# The Photographic Market\n\nVideo: Standard 1.33:1 Color\nAudio: ENGLISH: Dolby Digital Stereo\nSubtitle: Chinese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c604f91eeb744f15fce6eef0599227e117fe9a","amp;dn":"The+adventure+of+photography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c604f91eeb744f15fce6eef0599227e117fe9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,198,4,249,30,235,116,79,21,252,230,238,240,89,146,39,225,23,254,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
