Before digging into that critical topic, author Andrew Troelsen offers a concise overview of the COM architecture and provides examples using various COM frameworks (C++, ATL, and VB 6.0) as well as the core .NET managed languages (C# and VB .NET).\n\nAfter covering the preliminaries, the book explores numerous issues that arise in interoperability, including interacting with the Win32 API, dynamically generating source code via System.CodeDOM, creating serviced (COM+) components using managed code, manually editing (and recompiling) .NET metadata, and the process of constructing custom COM/.NET conversion utilities. Both intermediate and advanced developers will welcome the practical information they need to quickly work with COM and COM+ in .NET applications, and learn how to create .NET components that are COM compatible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42737bfeaaefec5642dbe01a9ce756fd45b238c2","amp;dn":"COM+and+.NET+Interoperability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42737bfeaaefec5642dbe01a9ce756fd45b238c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,115,123,254,170,239,236,86,66,219,224,26,156,231,86,253,69,178,56,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
