He delves into the background of the organizations and individuals who have sought to push global warming to the top of the political agenda, showing that beneath their cloak of green lurks a heart of red.\n\nWatermelons shows how the scientific method has been sacrificed on the altar of climate alarmism. Delingpole mocks the green movement's pathetic record of apocalyptic predictions, from the &quot;population bomb&quot; to global cooling, which failed to materialize. He reveals the fundamental misanthropy of green ideology, &quot;rooted in hatred of the human species, hell bent on destroying almost everything man has achieved&quot;.\n\nDelingpole gives a refreshing voice to widespread public skepticism over global warming, emphasising that the &quot;crisis&quot; has been engineered by people seeking to control our lives by imposing new taxes and regulations. &quot;Your taxes will be raised, your liberties curtailed and your money squandered to deal with this 'crisis'&quot;, he writes.\n\nAt its very roots, argues Delingpole, climate change is an ideological battle, not a scientific one. Green on the outside, red on the inside, the liberty-loathing, humanity-hating &quot;watermelons&quot; of the modern environmental movement do not want to save the world. They want to rule it.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nJames Delingpole is a libertarian conservative who writes brilliant books and brilliant articles, and is really great on TV, radio and the internet too. James is also the winner of the 2010 Bastiat Prize for Online journalism and is now eagerly seeking ways to escape David CameronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neo fascist Big Society Britain, so if any right-wing US think tanks want to offer a visiting fellowship or any presentersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ slots fall available on Fox News you know where to go. James Delingpole is officially the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best political blogger. (Well, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what the 2013 Bloggies said). Besides the Spectator, he is executive editor of Breitbart London","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee9c98f95cf1f57c77ee7bc3b39c23dd0fc823b","amp;dn":"Watermelons%3A+The+Green+Movement%27s+True+Colors+-+James+Delingpole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee9c98f95cf1f57c77ee7bc3b39c23dd0fc823b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,233,201,143,149,207,31,87,199,126,231,188,59,57,194,61,208,252,130,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
