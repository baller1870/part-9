Terrorist threats and actual violence have become increasingly dangerous and lethal since the 1970s. However, the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 11 September 2001 heralded a new era in terrorist action and were the culmination of a terror campaign against American targets world-wide. 'The Changing Face of Terrorism' evaluates the continuing threat and counter-measures since 9/11 and into the 21st century. It is a sober and measured evaluation of the CBRN threat and argues that continuing terror attacks are inevitable and the 'war on terror' will be a continuing feature in international politics and military action. Benjamin Cole shows how effective counter-terrorist measures must be measured and based not only on effective police and military intelligence and action but on careful evaluation of the politics, motivations, scientific and technical abilities of groups - no terrorist group has made a nuclear device - and religious and personal motivation.\n\n\nReview\n'This topic is unquestionably of major importance, on a par with some of the most serious environmental dangers we face.' --Adrian Guelke, Professor of Comparative Politics at the Centre for the Study of Ethnic Conflict, Queen's University, Belfast and author of 'Terrorism and Global Disorder'\n\n'This book has been meticulously researched and provides topical insights of great value to practitioners, academics and a student audience. The tone throughout is detached and the analysis is cogently argued and always relevant.' --J.E. Spence OBE, King's College London\nAbout the Author\nBenjamin Cole is an Honorary Reserach Fellow at the Centre for Critical Incident Research, School of Psychology, University of Liverpool - a new academic body specialising in the phenomenon of terrorism.
