First published in the children's magazine Young Folks, and considered a coming of age story, it is an adventure tale of superb atmosphere, character, and action, as well as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of moralityÃ¢â‚¬â€as seen in Long John SilverÃ¢â‚¬â€unusual for children's literature then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of all novels, and its influence on popular lore about pirates can not be overestimated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d92ee2b0700a0f695a6958d46e3e6a88c7d56a0","amp;dn":"Treasure+Island+by+Robert+Louis+Stevenson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d92ee2b0700a0f695a6958d46e3e6a88c7d56a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,146,238,43,7,0,160,246,149,166,149,141,70,227,230,168,140,125,86,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
