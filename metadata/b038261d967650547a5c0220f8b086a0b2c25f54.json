It also stars Roger Daltrey, Deborah Conway, John Lee Hooker, and Nina Simone.\n\nThe three then-surviving members of The Who (Daltrey, John Entwistle, and Townshend) performed as a group in two songs, &quot;Dig&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;, although the latter was not penned by Townshend.\n\n&quot;A Friend is a Friend&quot; and &quot;I Won't Run Anymore&quot; were released as singles; &quot;Fire&quot; was also issued as a promo-only in the United States.\n\nA stage version was mounted at the Young Vic theatre in London in 1993. On the strength of this, Warners optioned the story for a movie which, with a very different adaptation of the story, became The Iron Giant; Townshend received an Executive Producer credit.\n\nCharacters\n\n    Hogarth: Pete Townshend\n    The Vixen: Deborah Conway\n    The Iron Man: John Lee Hooker\n    The Space Dragon: Nina Simone\n    Hogarth's Father: Roger Daltrey\n    The Crow: Chyna\n    The Jay: Nicola Emmanuelle\n    The Frog: Billy Nicholls\n    The Owl: Simon Townshend\n    The Badger: Cleveland Watkiss\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;I Won't Run Any More&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:51 Vocals by Pete Townshend with Deborah Conway\n    &quot;Over the Top&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31 Vocals by John Lee Hooker\n    &quot;Man Machines&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:42 Vocals by Simon Townshend\n    &quot;Dig&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07 Performed by The Who\n    &quot;A Friend Is a Friend&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44 Vocals by Pete Townshend\n    &quot;I Eat Heavy Metal&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:01 Vocals by John Lee Hooker\n    &quot;All Shall Be Well&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:02 Vocals by Townshend with Conway and Chyna\n    &quot;Was There Life&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:19 Vocals by Pete Townshend\n    &quot;Fast Food&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:26 Vocals by Nina Simone\n    &quot;A Fool Says...&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51 Vocals by Pete Townshend\n    &quot;Fire&quot; (Brown, Crane, Finesilver, Peter Ker) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47 Performed by The Who\n    &quot;New Life/Reprise&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:00 Vocals by Chyna with Townshend\n\nBonus \n\n    &quot;Dig&quot; (Simon Townshend vocal version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09\n    &quot;Man Machines&quot; (long version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:34\n    &quot;I Eat Heavy Metal&quot; (demo) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b038261d967650547a5c0220f8b086a0b2c25f54","amp;dn":"Pete+Townshend+-+Iron+Man+%5BBONUS%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b038261d967650547a5c0220f8b086a0b2c25f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,56,38,29,150,118,80,84,122,92,2,32,248,176,134,160,178,194,95,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
