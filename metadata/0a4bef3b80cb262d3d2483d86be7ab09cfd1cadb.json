The objective of PHP with MySQL Essential Training is to teach both new and experienced web developers the comprehensive steps for building dynamic, data-driven, interactive websites. Using PHP 5.2.x and MySQL 5.0.x, instructor Kevin Skoglund demonstrates the entire process of building a content management system. He starts with the basics of the PHP language (variables, arrays, loops, functions, etc.) And works up to building dynamic web pages with a MySQL back end. Kevin also covers blueprinting applications; structuring and interacting with databases; building, validating, and processing forms; and regulating user access with passwords. In addition, he provides practical advice, offers examples of best practices, and demonstrates refactoring techniques for improving existing code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4bef3b80cb262d3d2483d86be7ab09cfd1cadb","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+PHP+With+MySQL+Essential+Training+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4bef3b80cb262d3d2483d86be7ab09cfd1cadb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,75,239,59,128,203,38,45,61,36,131,216,107,231,171,9,207,209,202,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
