The software delivers CAD importer tools and airfoil analysis at no charge to help manufacturers rapidly increase product and manufacturing quality identify process issues and build productivity. Advanced GD&amp;T, probing and dimensional inspection functions enable fast and precise measurement of parts, and Geomagic Qualify includes intelligent creation of reports in 3D PDF\n\nThe Geomagic Qualify Automation Platform delivers the power to streamline almost every process, reduce human interaction in measurements and recording, decrease measuring time, and markedly enhance R&amp;R results. Geomagic Qualify customers can dramatically cut production line down-time, increase accuracy and improve part quality during and after manufacturing\n\nGeomagic Qualify Probe\nFor machine tool shops and smaller manufacturing operations looking to elevate from manual processes, Geomagic Qualify Probe offers the affordability, usability and precision required to step into accurate fast checking of first-article parts\n\nGeomagic Qualify Probe delivers the most easy-to-use, affordable 3D inspection software that works exclusively with probing data reporting on the quality of as-built parts and automatically comparing the measurements to existing CAD data, if available, or other reference data\n\nGeomagic Qualify Probe combines the industry-leading tools from Geomagic Qualify with probing data and devices. Fast, automated reporting in 3D PDF and Microsoft Office formats allows results to be quickly reviewed by all parties, helping broad teams understand manufacturing issues more quickly\n\nGeomagic Studio\nGeomagic Studio is the complete toolbox for transforming 3D scanned data into highly accurate surface, polygon and native CAD models\n\nA vital component in a range of manufacturing workflows, Geomagic Studio provides the industry s most powerful point cloud editing, mesh editing and advanced surfacing functions in an intelligent, easy-to-use application. In addition to its precise 3D data processing functions\nGeomagic Studio incorporates incredible automated tools, all of which enable users to produce the highest quality models in significantly less time and reduce costly man-hours. For reverse engineering, product designs, rapid prototyping, analysis and CAD export, Geomagic Studio is the core 3D creation tool\n\nWith an included command line-driven version of the software and a new Python scripting environment, Geomagic Studio is introducing unrealized levels of speed and customization to go with its robust 3D processing capabilities. Geomagic Studio also streamlines the design process by enabling seamless transfer of parametric models to a number of major CAD packages: CATIA , Autodesk Inventor , CREO Elements/Pro (Pro/ENGINEER ) and SolidWorks\n\nGeomagic Wrap\nFrom artists to archeologists and designers to filmmakers, people from every walk of life are creating perfect 3D models of physical objects using Geomagic Wrap\n\nNow including exact surfacing with AutoSurface function, Geomagic Wrap delivers the most easy-to-use, affordable, fast, accurate path from point clouds to 3D polygonal models\n\nGeomagic Wrap enables users to transform point cloud data, probe data and imported 3D formats (STL, OBJ, etc.) into 3D polygon meshes for use in manufacturing, analysis, design, entertainment, archeology and analysis\n\n1) unRAR\n2) check &quot;install.txt&quot; from &quot;MAGNiTUDE&quot; dir\n3) enjoy another fine MAGNiTUDE-release!\n\nMagnitude, a measure of the brightness of a star - the Ancient Greek astronomers divided the stars into six magnitudes.
