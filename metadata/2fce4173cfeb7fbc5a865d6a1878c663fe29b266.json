The character of Anna was likely inspired, in part, by Maria Hartung (1832Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1919), the elder daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Soon after meeting her at dinner, Tolstoy started reading Pushkin's prose and once had a fleeting daydream of &quot;a bare exquisite aristocratic elbow&quot;, which proved to be the first intimation of Anna's character.\n\nAlthough most Russian critics panned the novel on its publication as a &quot;trifling romance of high life&quot;, Fyodor Dostoevsky declared it to be &quot;flawless as a work of art.&quot; His opinion is seconded by Vladimir Nabokov, who especially admired &quot;the flawless magic of Tolstoy's style&quot; and the motif of the moving train, which is subtly introduced in the first chapters (the children playing with a toy train) and inexorably developed in subsequent chapters (Anna's nightmare), thus heralding the novel's majestic finale. According to a recent poll of 125 contemporary authors, published in a book entitled The Top Ten, Anna Karenina is the greatest novel ever written.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fce4173cfeb7fbc5a865d6a1878c663fe29b266","amp;dn":"Anna+Karenina+by++Leo+Tolstoy+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fce4173cfeb7fbc5a865d6a1878c663fe29b266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,206,65,115,207,235,127,188,90,134,93,106,24,120,198,99,254,41,178,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
