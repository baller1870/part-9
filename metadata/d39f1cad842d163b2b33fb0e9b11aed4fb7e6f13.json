His follow up A Grand DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Come For Free (2004) - a concept album, a hip-hopera, whatever you wanted to call it - took Skinner to a completely new level of success (three million copies sold, a number one single and album, multiple Brit and Ivor Novello awards). It also gave a totally authentic but superbly artful voice to the real middle England - the middle England not of warm beer and cricket, but of Barratt Homes and Bacardi Breezers. Fast forward to his last album The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living (2006) - perhaps the most action-packed thirty-seven minutes in the history of pop, or rap, or rock and roll come to that - was nothing short of a voyage to the heart of celebrity darkness. Which brings us neatly to 2008 - The Streets fourth album is complete and set for release on September 15th . Everything Is Borrowed is a reminder of why we all fell in love with The Streets in the first place. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a charming, thoughtful and incisive album melding the very best components of the first three albums while managing to, as ever, sound refreshingly new. The title track Everything Is Borrowed will be released as a single on September 29th.\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Everything Is Borrowed\n2. Heaven For The Weather\n3.
