But to illustrate over looo works of sculpture in color, tracing the art as practiced from before the emergence of civilized man through ages of change and development until the present, seems impossible. It wasÃ¢â‚¬â€until this volume took shape under the guiding genius of Germain Bazin, whose vast knowledge of art in history has guided the project to completion.\n\nIllustrating his selection of world sculpture in color has added a new dimension to\nart book publication. It makes the simple act of looking an endless pleasure. Stone, bronze, and wood, turned by the carver's tools, take on an unending variety of color before one's eye. The subtleties of form intended by the sculptor are visually heightened. Even the silent passage of the centuries over their surface can be observed with more certainty.\n\nBazin's introductory text reveals the insight and clarity of first-rate scholarship.\nHere is a synthesis of many epochs and national styles into a continuity of  narrative. Each work, so carefully selected, is as carefully annotated in the author's captions.\n\nThe History of World Sculpture is a volume of reference which combines the best of\nauthorship with the best of book production to meet the test of many years of use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ae233fdcdd09a8d8ff890de05ecd0a9d739144","amp;dn":"The+History+of+World+Sculpture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ae233fdcdd09a8d8ff890de05ecd0a9d739144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,174,35,63,220,221,9,168,216,255,137,13,224,94,205,10,157,115,145,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
