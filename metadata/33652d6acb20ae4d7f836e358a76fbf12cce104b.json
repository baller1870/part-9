If something is repeated from the previous collections, it is certainly improved Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most often that means new annotations by the author herself (himself) :) \nIf a folder contains a complete variation version in Russian or Spanish, there might also be another base named Ã¢â‚¬Å“annotlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ containing only the games without variations. This is intended to provide u the opportunity to spot individual games without knowing Russian or Spanish. Use the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Search PositionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ function in Chessbase for that. Spot game, take position, search it in the base with variations, and u shall not need the name of the players in Latin letters. \nIf a folder contains a Ã¢â‚¬Å“TextoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ folder, than the Texto contains all games from the book in different folders (bottom of inside folder) and u have to load them one after the other. To spot a concrete game u have to build a base of all pgnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from the Texto, than find the game in the annotless base, search position and u will find it.\nEVERY BASE INSIDE IS DIFFERENT AND IT IS SO FOR REASON. \nFor the cb and pgn bases use Chessbase 12 or 13, this is the best choice.\nFor CDP bases use Chess Assistant and be careful not to download an infected version form some torrent. \nFor djvu use djvu viewer or Callibre. For epub and mobi use Callibre and u can also convert.\nHappy training!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33652d6acb20ae4d7f836e358a76fbf12cce104b","amp;dn":"CHESS+LITERATURE+3+-+Pdf+%2B+Chessbase","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33652d6acb20ae4d7f836e358a76fbf12cce104b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,101,45,106,203,32,174,77,127,131,110,53,138,118,251,241,44,206,16,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
