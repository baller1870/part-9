Anderson first graced the limelight under the guise of EMA in May 2011, when the brilliantly scuffed debut album Past Life Martyred Saints was released to a multitude of acclaim. After fronting the genre-defying cult duo Gowns, Past Life Martyred Saints offered a deeper glimpse into the world of EMA. If Past Life Martyred Saints was an inward exploration of human relationships and their toll, The Future's Void catapults them out into space, both thematically and musically.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e09edee1a69a9acadae4a69d8c3062b6dff904","amp;dn":"EMA.The.Futures.Void.2014.FLAC+%5BgoLdbLade%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e09edee1a69a9acadae4a69d8c3062b6dff904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,224,158,222,225,166,154,154,202,218,228,166,157,140,48,98,182,223,249,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
