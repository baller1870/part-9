Crucially, disease aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment in older people differ from the general adult population. Older people often have complicated co-morbidities and respond to treatment in different ways compared to younger people. Evidence of efficacy of different treatments is often lacking because older people are under-represented in clinical trials, and the specific needs of older people are rarely discussed specifically in more general texts. Geriatric medicine: an evidence based approach is a clinical reference for health care professionals who manage older patients, and summarizes up-to-date research literature in a style that can be directly applied by busy healthcare professionals and provide a useful resource for reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078fa0e60aeb4c078f783826d16fc20d0bdb8e48","amp;dn":"Geriatric+Medicine%2C+An+Evidence-Based+Approach+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078fa0e60aeb4c078f783826d16fc20d0bdb8e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,143,160,230,10,235,76,7,143,120,56,38,209,111,194,13,11,219,142,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
