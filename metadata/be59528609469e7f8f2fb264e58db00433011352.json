Original description follows.\n\n---\n\nThis a comic that you can only access from the Continuum site if you live in Canada. It was also available in a beautiful graphic novel format. It was released in a limited print run at Toronto's Fan Expo 2012.\nThe images are in 2 page format. Great if you're reading on computer, not so great if you read all your comic on an iPad like do. Still I appreciate that enterprising Canadian and the comic is really good. It explains a lot about why Kiera is so driven to bring down Liber8.\n\n&quot;Continuum The War Files, an 8 part graphic novel tells the story of \nKiera during the war between the Global Corporate Congress and the \nLiber8 rebels, featuring stories by Continuum creator Simon Barry and \nstar Rachel Nichols.\n\nIssue 1: Fire\nIssue 2: Front\nIssue 3: Casualty\nIssue 4: Collateral\nIssue 5: Hostage\nIssue 6: Entrenched\nIssue 7: Retreat\nIssue 8: Victory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be59528609469e7f8f2fb264e58db00433011352","amp;dn":"Continuum+The+War+Files+Complete+Comic+Series+%28F%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be59528609469e7f8f2fb264e58db00433011352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,89,82,134,9,70,158,127,143,47,178,100,229,141,176,4,51,1,19,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
