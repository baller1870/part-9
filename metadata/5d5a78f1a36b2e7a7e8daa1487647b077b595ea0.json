While Wise explores a spectrum of Chinese spying efforts, from Sun-Tzu's The Art of War to cyberspies, he homes in on two sensational cases, code-named Parlor Maid and Tiger Trap, that epitomize their tactics. Parlor Maid was the colorful Katrina Leung, a Chinese-American double agent who slept with her FBI handlers while stealing their secrets, and Tiger Trap refers to the FBI's operation to expose China's moles inside America's nuclear weapons labs. Wise's conclusion is soberingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;China's spying on America is ongoing, current, and shows no sign of diminishing&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and his book is a fascinating history of Chinese espionage that should appeal to a diverse readership.\n\nFor decades, while America obsessed over Soviet spies, China quietly penetrated the highest levels of government. Now, for the first time, based on numerous interviews with key insiders at the FBI and CIA as well as with Chinese agents and people close to them, David Wise tells the full story of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many victories and defeats in its American spy wars.Two key cases interweave throughout: Katrina Leung, code-named Parlor Maid, worked for the FBI for years, even after she became a secret double agent for China, aided by love affairs with both of her FBI handlers. Here, too, is the inside story of the case, code-named Tiger Trap, of a key Chinese-American scientist suspected of stealing nuclear weapons secrets. These two cases led to many others, involving famous names from Wen Ho Lee to Richard Nixon, stunning national security leaks, and sophisticated cyberspying. The story takes us up to the present, with a West Coast spy ring whose members were sentenced in 2010ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but it surely will continue for years to come, as China faces off against America. David WiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spy wars in America is packed with eye-popping revelations.\n\nJune 2011\nPublisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\nFormat: Hardcover 304pp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5a78f1a36b2e7a7e8daa1487647b077b595ea0","amp;dn":"Tiger+Trap%3A+America%5C%27s+Secret+Spy+War+with+China+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5a78f1a36b2e7a7e8daa1487647b077b595ea0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,90,120,241,163,107,46,122,126,141,170,20,135,100,123,7,123,89,94,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
