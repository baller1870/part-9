Steven is still an over-enthusiastic boy and more often than not, that gets in the way of his progress towards becoming a Gem. However, little by little, episode by episode he learns more about the Crystal Gems, their secrets, their history and the full extent of their powers. (Shape shifting anyone?) But of course, Steven being Steven, sometimes this new information leads to some Steven-y situations that no one, not even the Gems saw coming.\n\nGem Glow: Steven thinks his favorite ice cream sandwiches are the trick to summoning his magic shield but learns otherwise when facing off with an acid spewing insect monster.\n\nLaser Light Cannon: A magical comet hurtles toward Beach City, and Steven must dig through his father's collection of old junk, and the past, to find the weapon that can save the town.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n* Thanks to Yohp : I revised torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b941426f875b5e7ef3b39e93c27fd3a5a008ddf","amp;dn":"Steven.Universe.S01E01-E02.720p.WEB-DL.AAC2.0.H.264-STARDICT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b941426f875b5e7ef3b39e93c27fd3a5a008ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,148,20,38,248,117,181,231,239,59,57,233,60,39,253,58,90,0,141,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
