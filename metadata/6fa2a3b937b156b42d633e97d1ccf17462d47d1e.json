In it, he traces the development and decay of all of the major world civilizations in the historical record. Toynbee applies his model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration.\n\nThe nineteen major civilizations, as Toynbee sees them, are: Egyptian, Andean, Sinic, Minoan, Sumerian, Mayan, Indic, Hittite, Hellenic, Western, Orthodox Christian (Russia), Far Eastern, Orthodox Christian (main body), Persian, Arabic, Hindu, Mexican, Yucatec, and Babylonic. There are four 'abortive civilizations' (Abortive Far Western Christian, Abortive Far Eastern Christian, Abortive Scandinavian, Abortive Syriac) and five 'arrested civilizations' (Polynesian, Eskimo, Nomadic, Ottoman, Spartan).\n\nOriginally published over the course of several decades in twelve volumes totaling over 7000 words, this abridged edition condenses the first ten volumes into more manageable 580 pages, complete with illustrations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa2a3b937b156b42d633e97d1ccf17462d47d1e","amp;dn":"%5BA._Toynbee%5D_A_Study_of_History_%28illus.%29_%5BOne-Volu.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa2a3b937b156b42d633e97d1ccf17462d47d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,162,163,185,55,177,86,180,45,99,62,151,209,204,241,116,98,212,125,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
