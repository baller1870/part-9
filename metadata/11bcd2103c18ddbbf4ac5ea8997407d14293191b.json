You don't need to fiddle with windows to move or resize them to fit your desktop. Neither do you need to keep alternating between windows using Alt-Tab or the taskbar for simple tasks like copy-pasting or comparing documents. SplitView transforms a large single monitor system into a multi-monitor system enabling you to focus on your work, not on window management. SplitView - Terminal Server Edition enables a true multi-monitor experience with virtualization and server based computing technologies such as Citrix (RDP and ICA), VMware VDI, Microsoft Terminal Services, Remote Desktop, HP RGS and Sun Ray ALP. SplitView also provides several productivity boosting enhancements such as the ability to move windows efficiently between multiple monitors, so you can focus on work, not on window management","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11bcd2103c18ddbbf4ac5ea8997407d14293191b","amp;dn":"SplitView+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11bcd2103c18ddbbf4ac5ea8997407d14293191b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,188,210,16,60,24,221,187,244,172,94,168,153,116,7,209,66,147,25,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
