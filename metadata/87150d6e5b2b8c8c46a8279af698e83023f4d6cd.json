Addressing both of these key elements, Programming 2D Games provides a complete, up-to-date introduction to game programming. \n\nAll of the code in the book was carefully crafted using C++. As game programming techniques are introduced, students learn how to incorporate them into their own game engine and discover how to use the game engine to create a complete game.\n\nEnables Students to Create 2D Games\n\nThe text covers sprites, animation, collision detection, sound, text display, game dashboards, special graphic effects, tiled games, and network programming. It systematically explains how to program DirectX applications and emphasizes proper software engineering techniques. Every topic is explained theoretically and with working code examples.\n\nGenre: Computer Related/Programming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87150d6e5b2b8c8c46a8279af698e83023f4d6cd","amp;dn":"Programming+2D+Games+by+Charles+Kelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87150d6e5b2b8c8c46a8279af698e83023f4d6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,21,13,110,91,43,140,140,70,168,39,154,246,152,232,48,35,244,214,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
