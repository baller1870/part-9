The diversity of the material on the album highlighted the skill with which Morrison could fuse Celtic folk, R&amp;B, blues, jazz and the singer-songwriter genre. &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)&quot; and the title track, top quality blends of Stax soul and folk, became staples of his live set, while lesser known tracks such as &quot;Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Redwood Tree&quot; continued to display a lyrical celebration of nature's beauty.\n\nAlso on the album were two lengthy, hypnotic tracks, &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; and the closing &quot;Almost Independence Day&quot; which were given primal, cathartic and intense vocal performances from Morrison. These tracks were more similar to the songs on his critically lauded 1968 song-cycle Astral Weeks.\n\nRolling Stone Magazine declared it &quot;the best-produced, most ambitious Van Morrison record yet released.&quot;[1]It ranks at #36 at Rate Your Music's Top Albums of 1972.[2]\n\nIt was his first album not to have love as its central theme and significantly (as his marriage was deteriorating) the cover shows Morrison looking like a gypsy troubadour out on the street.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3685f20e2b25376c499ee0747c82de61ef40e407","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Saint+Dominic%27s+Preview+%5B1972%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3685f20e2b25376c499ee0747c82de61ef40e407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,133,242,14,43,37,55,108,73,158,224,116,124,130,222,97,239,64,228,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
