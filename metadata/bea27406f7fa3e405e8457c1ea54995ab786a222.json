He and his physician wife, Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross), are living the American dream: great careers, four beautiful kids, and a colonial home in an upper middle class neighborhood. But has success brought too much assimilation for this black family? With a little help from his Dad (Lawrence Fishburne), Dre sets out to establish a sense of cultural identity for his family that honors their past while embracing the future.\n\nPilot\nReleased Sep 24, 2014\nLike any parents, Andre &quot;Dre&quot; and Rainbow Johnson want to give their children the best. But their offspring's childhood is turning out to be much different than theirs. They now realize at least two things: there is a price to pay for giving their children more than what they ever had, and these loving parents are totally unprepared for the fallout.\n\nfree early release on iTunes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea27406f7fa3e405e8457c1ea54995ab786a222","amp;dn":"Black-Ish+S01E01+Pilot+WEB+DL+x264+RKSTR+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea27406f7fa3e405e8457c1ea54995ab786a222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,162,116,6,247,250,62,64,94,132,87,193,234,84,153,90,183,134,162,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
