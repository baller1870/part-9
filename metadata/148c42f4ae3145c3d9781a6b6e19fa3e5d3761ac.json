What's more, it's both practical and realistic as it cuts through the clutter, decodes the marketing hype, and gets straight to the point; whether from India or America, Sweden or Ireland, Japan or the hills, glens, and islands of ScotlandÃ¢â‚¬â€here are the 101 whiskies that every whiskey enthusiast needs to try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148c42f4ae3145c3d9781a6b6e19fa3e5d3761ac","amp;dn":"101+Whiskies+to+Try+Before+You+Die+by+Maestral","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148c42f4ae3145c3d9781a6b6e19fa3e5d3761ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,140,66,244,174,49,69,195,217,120,26,107,110,25,250,62,93,55,97,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
