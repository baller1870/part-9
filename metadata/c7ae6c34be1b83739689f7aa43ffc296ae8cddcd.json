Well, they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really. But lo, raise thy flagon to the 80s, for through the mists of legendry* (*actual phrase from the movie) they bring us The Sword and the Sorcerer!\n\nBefore George R.R. Martin ever Gamed a Throne, The Sword and the Sorcerer had a witch bringing forth a hideous monster, a noble family of good guys getting wiped out, and even a Red Wedding! Or at least a Magenta Wedding. It also has a three-bladed sword that shoots blades, the kind of idea that seems like it could only have been pitched by an 8 year old boy right after the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know what would be COOL?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFollow the adventures of our hero, Talon, a rogue/warrior/buccaneer/general/upholsterer/freelance architect/hooker with a heart of gold, as he gets vengeance and shoots his sword and swings on ropes and whatnot, yÃ¢â‚¬â„¢know, hero stuff.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high fantasy, just like the blacklight posters and pewter figurines at SpencerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gifts envisioned! Join The Mike and The Bill and The Kevin for The Sword and the Sorcerer!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ae6c34be1b83739689f7aa43ffc296ae8cddcd","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+The+Sword+and+the+Sorcerer.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ae6c34be1b83739689f7aa43ffc296ae8cddcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,174,108,52,190,27,131,115,150,137,247,170,67,255,194,150,174,140,221,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
