Source Presents: Hip Hop Hits, Vol. 7 buy CD music Ludacris races out of the gates with his revved-up 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS soundtrack contribution, &quot;Act a Fool.&quot; Snoop Dogg brings his nonchalant swagger to the soul-tinged &quot;Beautiful,&quot; while 2Pac is represented by a posthumous track that features breakout R&amp;B singer Anthony Hamilton. Even Though Nelly's &quot;Air Force Ones&quot; Bone Crusher's remix of &quot;Neva Scared&quot;, and David Banner's &quot;Like a Pimp&quot; eat up over a quarter of the album, it seems like there aren't enough Southern hits by half. Nevertheless, the disc does tend to stick to the tracks that were most popular, appealing most to those who haven't picked up many full-lengths -- there's Missy Elliott's &quot;Work It,&quot; DMX's &quot;Where the Hood At,&quot; and Lil' Kim's &quot;The Jump Off&quot; as well. \n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n1.
