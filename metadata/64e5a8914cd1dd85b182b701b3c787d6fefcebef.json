Its army: thousands of culinary students. Its leader: the Peruvian chef GastÃ³n Acurio. Its weapons: centuries of ethnic fusion.\r\nIn his documentary &quot;Cooking Up Dreams&quot;, renowned Peruvian director Ernesto Cabellos, presents his country's spectacular cuisine and asks himself: Can an entire nation be represented by its cuisine? This documentary journeys to the kitchens of Peru's coast, highlands and jungle, as well as Peruvian expat communities in Paris, London, Amsterdam and New York for answers.\r\nFrom the most humble family kitchens to the poshest restaurants, from stories of pioneering Peruvian chefs abroad to those who preserve ancient recipes at home, we find that Peru's cuisine is deliciously integrating for its people, who have historically been divided by ethnic and economic differences. This documentary isn't just about food. This documentary is about integration, challenges, culture, poverty and wealth. We'll discover the origin of Peru's ubiquitous national dish - cebiche - the anticuchos of beef hearts or the annual meal mourners share at the graves of their dead relatives.\r\nFamed chefs such as Spain's Ferran AdriÃ , as well as Peru's GastÃ³n Acurio share their views and experiences with Peru's cuisine alongside the thousands of unsung chefs, who also dream of Peru's cuisine as a motor of development.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f3/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Cooking-up-Dreams-Peruvian-Cuisine-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~1187Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 854x480\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 30000/1001 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~123Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (Spanish)\r\n * Run-Time: 75 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 706 MB\r\n * Source: DVD\r\n * Subtitles: English, French, Portuguese and Spanish (vobsub)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.guarango.org/dols/\r\n *Youtube trailer by Asociacion Guarango]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e5a8914cd1dd85b182b701b3c787d6fefcebef","amp;dn":"Cooking+up+Dreams+Peruvian+Cuisine+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e5a8914cd1dd85b182b701b3c787d6fefcebef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,229,168,145,76,209,221,133,177,130,183,1,179,199,135,214,254,252,235,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
