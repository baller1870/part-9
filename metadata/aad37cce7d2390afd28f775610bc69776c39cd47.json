It was quickly replaced by Gotham Knights.\n\nStarted as a showcase for Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, (and after a short time just Grant). Once Grant was no longer on the title, the creative teams changed for just about every story arc. For the most part each arc was self- contained within the 'Shadow of the Bat' series. Brian Stelfreeze provided covers for much of the run.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad37cce7d2390afd28f775610bc69776c39cd47","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Shadow+of+the+Bat+%28000+-+094+%2B+Annuals%29+%281992+-+2000%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad37cce7d2390afd28f775610bc69776c39cd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,211,124,206,125,35,144,175,210,143,119,86,16,188,105,119,108,57,205,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
