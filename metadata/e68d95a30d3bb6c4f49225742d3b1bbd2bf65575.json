Released in 1997, Mortal Kombat 4 is the first title from the series to use 3D computer graphics as well as one of the first games that Midway made in 3D. Eurocom later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released a year later exclusively for the Dreamcast.\n\nThe gameplay from Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted god Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm various of years prior to the series' start: the other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness attempting to conquer all the realms (Mortal Kombat Gold would expand the number of available characters).\n\nSystem requirements\n\nSystem: Pentium-133 or equivalent RAM: 32 MB Video Memory: 2 MB Hard Drive Space: 25 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68d95a30d3bb6c4f49225742d3b1bbd2bf65575","amp;dn":"Mortal+Kombat+4+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68d95a30d3bb6c4f49225742d3b1bbd2bf65575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,141,149,163,13,59,182,196,244,146,37,116,45,59,27,189,43,246,85,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
