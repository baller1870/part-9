ECGs from real patient cases offer a complete and in-depth learning experience by focusing on fundamental electrophysiologic properties and clinical concepts as well as detailed discussion of important diagnostic findings and relevant management decisions. Six comprehensive volumes encompass more than 600 individual case studies--plus an online repository of hundreds more interactive case studies that include feedback and discussion about the important waveforms and clinical decision-making involved. From an introductory volume that outlines the approaches and tools utilized in the analysis of all ECGs to subsequent volumes covering particular disease entities for which the ECG is useful, readers will take away the in-depth knowledge needed to successfully interpret the spectrum of routine to challenging ECGs they will encounter in their own clinical practice.\n\nVolume 2, Myocardial Abnormalities, breaks down the essential skills necessary for diagnosing acute myocardial ischemia as well as acute and chronic myocardial infarction--arguably the most important component of the ECG armamentarium across the spectrum of health care professions. It also demonstrates the skills needed for the diagnosis of myocardial hypertrophy, atrial abnormality, and pericarditis.
