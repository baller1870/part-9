ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts, so we sound smart and in control, and so that we fit into society. But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How to get unstuck?\n\n For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s used for years to solve all types of business problems, and generate ideas for books, articles and blog posts. Freewriting is deceptively simple: Start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to keep up with your output, and will be temporarily shunted into the background. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll now be able to think more honestly and resourcefully than before, and will generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have created any other way.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e098bfbb66a49ce0ef7056cb820db0f40923176","amp;dn":"Accidental+Genius%3A+Using+Writing+to+Generate+Your+Best+Ideas%2C+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e098bfbb66a49ce0ef7056cb820db0f40923176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,9,139,251,182,106,73,206,14,247,5,108,184,32,219,15,64,146,49,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
