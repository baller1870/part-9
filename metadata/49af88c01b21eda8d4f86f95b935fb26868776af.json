Miller) was hailed by the Los Angeles Times as &quot;a rollicking bit of pop science that turns the lens of evolutionary psychology on issues of the day.&quot; That book answered such burning questions as why women tend to lust after males who already have mates and why newborns look more like Dad than Mom. Now Kanazawa tackles the nature of intelligence: what it is, what it does, what it is good for (if anything). Highly entertaining, smart (dare we say intelligent?), and daringly contrarian, The Intelligence Paradox will provide a deeper understanding of what intelligence is, and what it means for us in our lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49af88c01b21eda8d4f86f95b935fb26868776af","amp;dn":"The+Intelligence+Paradox+-+Why+the+Intelligent+Choice+Isn%27t+Alwa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49af88c01b21eda8d4f86f95b935fb26868776af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,175,136,192,27,33,237,168,212,248,111,149,185,53,251,38,134,135,118,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
