A N T H O N Y   P H I L L I P S\n                          - The Geese &amp; The Ghost -\n\nAnt Phillips was the guitarist of the legendary progessive rock group Genesis until Trespass in 1970.\nWhen you listen to this, his first solo album, the evidence is clear how deeply this man's influence on the early music of Genesis had been. It's very calm music in a medieval and pastoral mood. This album will grow on you in spite of the shallow impression at first listenings and is an absolutely must-have for fans of the early Genesis stuff.\n\n- First release on LP in 1977\n- CD reissued 1990\n- All other infos: see enclosed booklet\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c7dab62d4c77df1e19e0d740b9d75e1eb0866f","amp;dn":"Anthony+Phillips+-+1977+-+The+Geese+%26+The+Ghost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c7dab62d4c77df1e19e0d740b9d75e1eb0866f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,199,218,182,45,76,119,223,30,25,224,215,64,185,215,94,30,176,134,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
