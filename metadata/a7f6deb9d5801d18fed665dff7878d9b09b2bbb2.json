And as these two amateurs work to solve these mysteries, they manage to stir up all manner of trouble in the congregation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f6deb9d5801d18fed665dff7878d9b09b2bbb2","amp;dn":"Pat+G%27orge-Walker-Holy+Mayhem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f6deb9d5801d18fed665dff7878d9b09b2bbb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,246,222,185,213,128,29,24,254,214,101,223,247,135,141,155,9,178,187,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
