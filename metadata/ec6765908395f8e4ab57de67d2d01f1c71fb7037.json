It was released on 17 September 2012 through Hassle Records in the United Kingdom and through SideOneDummy the next day, 18 September in the United States. The album is the first to be done by the band without their original lead vocalist Dan Brown, whom left the band to be their band manager.[1] The music featured on the album is seen as being a massive jump since the last album, Go Now and Live.[2] Two singles have been released by the band in promotion: &quot;Bleed&quot; and &quot;The Road&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\nOriginal CD\t\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Stanford Rivers&quot;  \t1:13\n2.\t&quot;Bleed&quot;  \t2:49\n3.\t&quot;Young Heart&quot;  \t3:47\n4.\t&quot;Story of a Modern Child&quot;  \t3:07\n5.\t&quot;Machine&quot;  \t3:39\n6.\t&quot;The Road (Run for Miles)&quot;  \t3:41\n7.\t&quot;Golden Gate&quot;  \t5:35\n8.\t&quot;Maybe Today, Maybe Tomorrow&quot;  \t3:40\n9.\t&quot;Pass Me By&quot;  \t3:42\n10.\t&quot;Chin Up, Son&quot;  \t3:22\nTotal length:\n32:35\t\n\nThis album is a 320 kbps CDRip but does not include the Itunes bonus track &quot;One of Those Days&quot;\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec6765908395f8e4ab57de67d2d01f1c71fb7037","amp;dn":"We+Are+The+Ocean+-+Maybe+Today%2C+Maybe+Tomorrow+%28320+kbps%29+CDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec6765908395f8e4ab57de67d2d01f1c71fb7037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,103,101,144,131,149,248,228,171,87,222,103,210,208,31,28,113,251,112,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
