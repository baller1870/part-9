Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nShort story collection.\n\ndescription:\n\nIn Barcelona, an aging Brazilian prostitute trains her dog to weep at the grave she has chosen for herself. In Vienna, a woman parlays her gift for seeing the future into a fortunetelling position with a wealthy family. In Geneva, an ambulance driver and his wife take in the lonely, apparently dying ex-President of a Caribbean country, only to discover that his political ambition is very much intact. \n\nIn these twelve masterly stories about the lives of Latin Americans in Europe, GarcÃƒÂ­a Marquez conveys the peculiar amalgam of melancholy, tenacity, sorrow, and aspiration that is the emigrÃƒÂ© experience.\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nExile and loss are the principal subjects of these 12 stories from the author of Love in the Time of Cholera , which capture with lyrical precision the emotions of disorientation and fear, coupled with a sense of new possibility, experienced by Latin Americans in Europe. Their pilgrimages seldom achieve their goals: the deposed politician in &quot; Bon Voyage , Mister President&quot; sells all his personal belongings to have an operation in Geneva that doesn't alleviate his pain; the devoted father who brings the miraculously intact remains of his seven-year-old daughter to Rome in &quot;The Saint&quot; can't get an audience with the Pope; a particularly chilling tale, &quot;I Only Came to Use the Phone,&quot; shows a woman accidentally taken to an insane asylum who can't get out even after she contacts her husband in Barcelona. A note of hard-won hope enters in stories like &quot;Maria dos Prazeres,&quot; which portrays an elderly prostitute selecting her burial site, but the mood darkens again as the collection closes with &quot;Tramontania,&quot; &quot;Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness,&quot; &quot;Light Is Like Water&quot; and &quot;The Trail of Your Blood in the Snow,&quot; tales of suicide, murder, accidental death and tragically missed communications. Lovely prose and some poignant insights contribute to a collection that pleases in its parts but fails to strike a lasting note. But even a minor effort from Garcia Marquez is a standard toward which other writers aspire.\n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nThe Nobel prize-winning author Garcia Marquez has collected a dozen of his stories about Latin Americans in Europe, most of which, although magical, end on an unsettling note. Thus, an expatriate ex-president is recognized by an ambulance driver bent on exploitation; a man travels from Colombia to Rome with a cello case to see the pope; a woman with car trouble finds herself trapped in a mental institution; a prostitute plans her funeral. The plots are simple, but the character study and use of language is incisive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:440807274ed3a94e630524f7067e5108a83bca89","amp;dn":"Gabriel+Garcia+Marquez+-+Strange+Pilgrims+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"440807274ed3a94e630524f7067e5108a83bca89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,8,7,39,78,211,169,78,99,5,36,247,6,126,81,8,168,59,202,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
