Back In 1998, It Wasn't Until The Laid-Back Third Single &quot;Got The Feelin'&quot; Hit The Top Three That The Boys Released Their Self-Titled Debut And Propelled Themselves Into Pop Superstardom. From Then Followed A Host Of Pop Classics Borrowing From Rock, Rap, Soul And Dance--Giving The Boys Three Number Ones With &quot;Keep On Movin'&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (From Invincible) And &quot;Let's Dance&quot; (From Kingsize). Always Pitching Themselves As The Antithesis Of &quot;Wet&quot; Boy Bands, Their Greatest Hits Is A Touch Light On The Ballad Side Of Things. However, The Delicate &quot;Until The Time Is Through&quot; And The Poignant &quot;Closer To Me&quot; Do Raise A Smile (And A Tear) Or Two, But For The Best Part It's Fists In The Air, Hard-Rocking, Good-Time Pop.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] We Will Rock You\n[02] Keep On Movin'\n[03] If Ya Gettin' Down\n[04] Everybody Get Up\n[05] Let's Dance\n[06] Rock The Party\n[07] Got The Feelin'\n[08] When The Lights Go Out\n[09] Closer To Me\n[10] Until The Time Is Through\n[11] Don't Wanna Let You Go\n[12] Slam Dunk (Da Funk)\n[13] It's The Things You Do\n[14] When I Remember When\n[15] Inspector Gadget\n[16] Set Me Free\n[17] Keep On Movin'            - [World Cup 2002 Mix]\n[18] Greatest Hits Megamix     - [Jewel &amp; Stone Remix]\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t\t- 01h:10m:32s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t\t- 168mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t\t- I- Tunes v8.1.1.10 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t\t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t\t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t\t- only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t\t- Pop Rap\n\nRelease Date\t\t\t- 19 November 2001\n\nRecord Company\t\t\t- BMG\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t\t- http://www.worldoffive.com \n\t\t\t\t-\n                                    - http://www.muzu.tv/five \n\n\t\t\t \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bab1ffa7bc74a029a8f8dc4bacb98988641348","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Five+-+168mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bab1ffa7bc74a029a8f8dc4bacb98988641348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,186,177,255,167,188,116,160,41,168,248,220,75,172,185,137,136,100,19,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
