The group was part of the English new wave movement that included bands like Duran Duran and had a string of early hit singles including &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, &quot;It's My Life&quot;, &quot;Such a Shame&quot;, and &quot;Dum Dum Girl&quot;. Always uncomfortable with the requirements and pressure of the pop industry, Talk Talk moved away from synthpop toward more experimental music in the mid-1980s. A few more singles, including &quot;Life's What You Make It&quot; and &quot;Living in Another World&quot;, achieved success in Europe and in the UK, but their commercial appeal receded quickly as their critical reputation increased.\n\nThe band broke up in 1991. Singer Mark Hollis released one solo album before retiring from the music industry. Founding bass player and drummer Paul Webb and Lee Harris played in a couple of bands together; de facto fourth member Tim Friese-Greene continued in the business as a musician and producer.\n\n\nIt's My Life is the second studio album by Talk Talk, released in 1984.\n\n\nRecorded\n1984\n\nGenre\nNew Wave\n\nLabel\nEMI\n\nProducer\nTim Friese-Greene\n\nFormat\nFLAC\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
