With no prior research, no characters, no sites, nor specific themes, a film team arrive to the hinterland of ParaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ba state in northeastern Brazil in search of people with stories to tell.

With a girl from AraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s as mediator, the residents, in their majority, elderly, tell their life story, marked by popular catholicism, by a hierarchy, by a sense of family and honor - in a world fast disappearing\n\n\nsorry, no subs.
