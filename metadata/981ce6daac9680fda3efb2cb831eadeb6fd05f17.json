Her initially debut, the minseries, NYX:, showed off her skills but didn't give her origins. The is the first series where we get to know Laura Kinney from the start - a pretty face that masks a killing machine every bit as lethal as Wolverine, with whom she shares her genetic material. We see her struggles with fighting her programming while also accepting it, and coping with the larger outside world after being sequestered in the Weapon Plus prougram for so long. Craig Kyle and Chris Yost team up for the story, titled &quot;Innocence Lost&quot;, and Billy Tan does some great art. This digital copy of the limited series is thanks to ZoneKing-Empire. Please seed, enjoy! :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981ce6daac9680fda3efb2cb831eadeb6fd05f17","amp;dn":"X-23+%28X23%29+v1+01-06+%282005%2C+Digital%2C+Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981ce6daac9680fda3efb2cb831eadeb6fd05f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,28,230,218,172,150,128,253,163,239,178,203,131,30,173,235,111,208,95,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
