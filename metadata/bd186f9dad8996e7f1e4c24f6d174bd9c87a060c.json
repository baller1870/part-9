But when the job opens, it is given to Joe Dombrowski, a Polish-American immigrant who spends his free time reading technical books on the workings of a drill press rather than socializing with other workers. Frank becomes disgruntled and is easily recruited by a co-worker to join the Black Legion, a secretive hate group similar to the Ku Klux Klan, which appeals to the xenophobic fears of its members and uses violence to intimidate foreign-born Americans.\n\nDirector:\nArchie Mayo\n\nCast:\nHumphrey Bogart\t... \tFrank Taylor\t\nDick Foran\t... \tEd Jackson\nAnn Sheridan\t... \tBetty Grogan\nJoe Sawyer\t... \tCliff Summers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd186f9dad8996e7f1e4c24f6d174bd9c87a060c","amp;dn":"Humphrey+Bogart+-+Black+Legion+-+1937+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd186f9dad8996e7f1e4c24f6d174bd9c87a060c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,24,111,157,173,137,150,231,241,228,194,79,109,23,75,217,200,122,6,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
