A Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band, THE DOORS, fractured because of this. In his book, drummer John Densmore looks at the conflict between him and his band mates as they fought over the right to use The DoorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ name. At the same time, Densmore examines how this conflict mirrors and reflects a much larger societal issue - that no amount of money seems to be enough for even the wealthiest people","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7e9a210e515f5d9c5b1e61a9af00a747de0b41","amp;dn":"The+Doors+Unhinged+-+John+Densmore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c7e9a210e515f5d9c5b1e61a9af00a747de0b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,126,154,33,14,81,95,93,156,91,30,97,169,175,0,167,71,222,11,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
