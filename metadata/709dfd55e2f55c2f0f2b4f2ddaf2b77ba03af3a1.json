This is truly beyond the cutting edge ...\n\n\nProduct Information\n\nSince his extraordinary awakening in 1990 and 1991, David Icke has been on a journey across the world,\nand within himself, to find the Big answers to the Big questions: Who are we? Where are we? What are we\ndoing here? Who really controls this world and how and why?\n\nIn this seven-hour presentation to 2,500 people at the Brixton Academy in London, David addresses all these\nquestions and connects the dots between them to reveal a picture of life on earth that is truly beyond the\ncutting edge.\n\nNowhere in the world will you see a presentation like this one, which connects the apparently unconnected\nto form the tapestry of knowledge that can set us free from our collective enslavement by the hidden powers\nbehind government, banking, business, media and all the other agencies of manipulation and control.\n\nWhat is the connection between ancient history, 9/11, the war on terror, the gathering Orwellian nightmare\nand the nature of reality itself? It seems a strange question to most people, but in fact all are fundamentally\nlinked, as Icke so compellingly reveals.\n\nAs he says: Without understanding the nature of our experienced reality and how we create it, we cannot truly\nunderstand anything else.\n\nTens of millions around the world have become aware of David Icke and his work as what he has written in a\nstream of books has become our daily experience.\n\nNow, go with him to the next stage of his incredible journey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a journey Beyond the Cutting Edge.\n\nOver 7 hours of footage.\n\nIF YOU SUPPORT DAVID ICKE PLEASE VISIT HIS WEBSITE AND DONATE.\n\nFilelist:\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd1 cd1.avi\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd1 cd2.avi\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd2 cd1.avi\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd2 cd2.avi\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd3 cd1.avi\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd3 cd2.avi\nDavid Icke Beyond the cutting edge {2008}.txt\ntracked_by_h33t_com.txt\n\n8 files; 4,404,204,544 bytes\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd1 cd1.avi\n\nVideo: 720 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 1hr\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd1 cd2.avi\n\nVideo: 720 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 1hr 3min\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd2 cd1.avi\n\nVideo: 560 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 1hr 11min\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd2 cd2.avi\n\nVideo: 560 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 1hr 26min\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd3 cd1.avi\n\nVideo: 720 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 46min\n\nBeyond the cutting edge dvd3 cd2.avi\n\nVideo: 720 x 416\nCodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAudio: 48000Hz  192 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)  \nCodec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nFrame: 25fps\nLength: 52min","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:709dfd55e2f55c2f0f2b4f2ddaf2b77ba03af3a1","amp;dn":"David+Icke+Beyond+the+cutting+edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"709dfd55e2f55c2f0f2b4f2ddaf2b77ba03af3a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,157,253,85,226,245,92,47,15,43,79,45,218,242,183,123,160,58,243,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
