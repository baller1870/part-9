From the literary spark of Dante's Inferno to the\nbloody aftermath of a 75-mph highway crash, Red absorbed a flood\nof ideas and emotions that empowered the band to create next\ngeneration rock songs. Finding the sonic sweet spot where epic and\nprimal converge, Innocence &amp; Instinct features animated dynamics\nthat super-charge its innocence vs. instinct theme.\n\n&quot;Innocence &amp; Instinct is about the duality of man,&quot; explains\nguitarist Jasen Rauch. &quot;The album examines the fight between our\nchildlike innocence and the instinctive side that makes us do\nthings we shouldn't.&quot;\n\nThe group's debut, which sold over a quarter-million copies and\nearned several awards and nominations, focused heavily on personal\nstruggles. Bringing back Silence producer Rob Graves and mixer Ben\nGrosse (Sevendust, Disturbed, Depeche Mode), Innocence &amp; Instinct\ngoes a giant step further by tackling the fight itself. It's about\nthe dueling impulses that wage war within our souls.\n\nIn writing the album, Red found Inferno to be an illuminating\nguide. The literary classic, which starts with Dante and Virgil\nstanding before the Gates of Hell, illustrated ways in which the\nband might tackle deep issues in a more poetic way. And if Dante\nenhanced the storytelling, a highway crash in late '07 accelerated\nthe band's emotional core. As the tour van smashed into a\nguardrail and violently slid sideways across the highway, the band\nexperienced new heights of horror that they channeled into\nInnocence &amp; Instinct.\n\n&quot;It brought an intensity and depth that we couldn't reach without\ngoing through this experience,&quot; Rauch reflects. &quot;In the months\nafter the accident, it felt like everything was in overdrive.&quot;\n\n&quot;In a split second, it changed our lives,&quot; adds six-stringer\nAnthony Armstrong, whose twin brother Randy handles the band's\nbasslines.\n\nSetting the tone early, &quot;Fight Inside&quot; rides beautiful piano keys\nto an unforgettable chorus as glaring agitation builds to a savage\nfinish. The song epitomizes the album's effortless transitions\nbetween simmering angst, melodic hooks and pretty major-key\nresolves, while its inner-monologue sets up the lyrical theme by\ncursing the frail duality of innocence and instinct. &quot;Death of Me&quot;\nfurthers the first-person schizophrenia as vocalist Michael Barnes\ncries &quot;You tear me down and then you pick me up&quot; against a\nbackdrop of deafening guitars, sweeping symphonics and\nnerve-rattling screams. &quot;Shadows,&quot; co-written by Ben Burnley of\nBreaking Benjamin, pushes against the darkness while &quot;Out From\nUnder&quot; could be called Fight Club with guitars.\n\n&quot;There are moments that switch between never feeling so close to\nsomeone to never feeling so abandoned, but that's part of the\nhuman experience,&quot; says Rauch. &quot;These extreme feelings, these\nparadoxes, coexist all the time.&quot;\n\nWhile several songs veer toward an internal apocalypse, &quot;Never Be\nthe Same&quot; personifies Innocence with optimistic reflections poured\nout over lush fields of electric and acoustic guitars. The\npiano-powered &quot;Start Again&quot; addresses the conflicted remorse of a\nfailed relationship, while &quot;Mystery of You&quot; ponders the\ninexplicable over industrial-strength loops and keys. Innocence &amp;\nInstinct even features a juiced-up cover of Duran Duran's utopian\n&quot;Ordinary World.&quot;\n\nFormed in Nashville, Tennessee over four years ago, Red made an\nimmediate impact with its 2006 debut, End of Silence. The\nGrammy-nominated disc, featuring the radio hits &quot;Breathe Into Me&quot;\n(Top 10, Active Rock) and &quot;Already Over&quot; (Top 15, Active Rock),\nintroduced the sonic layering, rich orchestration and visceral\ndynamics that became Red's signature sound. The album steadily\nbuilt momentum cracking the Billboard 200 a year after its release\nas sales steadily broke out to hundreds of thousands of copies\nsold. Not surprisingly, the album became a hit with other bands as\nwell, leading to tours and shows with Papa Roach, Sevendust, Three\nDays Grace, Flyleaf, Buckcherry and Seether, among others. These\nopportunities contributed to the band's impressive 500+ live show\nschedule between albums.\n\nHeading into Innocence &amp; Instinct, Red had no shortage of creative\nsparks. A near-death accident ignited their emotions, a literary\nmasterpiece spurred their creativity, peer support lifted their\nspirits, heavy touring empowered their performances and fans\nchallenged the group to do even more to impact their lives. These\nexperiences infused Innocence &amp; Instinct with layered narratives,\nheightened sensibilities and an artistic boldness that\ndramatically raises the bar for new millennial rock 'n' roll.\n\nIn Dante's Inferno, the Gates of Hell read, &quot;Abandon all hope, ye\nwho enter here.&quot; But when the Gates finally face Innocence &amp;\nInstinct, Hell won't know what hit it.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d459f6b038396f1a328a765f4065de9e53a92de1","amp;dn":"Red-Innocence_And_Instinct-2009-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d459f6b038396f1a328a765f4065de9e53a92de1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,89,246,176,56,57,111,26,50,138,118,95,64,101,222,158,83,169,45,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
