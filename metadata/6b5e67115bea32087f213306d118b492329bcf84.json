Exhaustively researched with transcripts of interviews with killers, and featuring up-to-date information on the apprehension and conviction of the Green River Killer and the Beltway Snipers, Vronsky's one-of-a-kind book covers every conceivable aspect of an endlessly riveting true-crime phenomenon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b5e67115bea32087f213306d118b492329bcf84","amp;dn":"Serial+Killers+-+The+Method+And+Madness+Of+Monsters+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b5e67115bea32087f213306d118b492329bcf84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,94,103,17,91,234,50,8,127,33,51,6,209,24,180,146,50,155,207,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
