And for nonscientists, exploring this extraordinary realm is one of the best introductions to the immensely rich subject of physics.\n\nConsider these questions:\n\nCan machines produce limitless energy?\nIs time travel possible?\nCan anything travel faster than light?\nIs it possible to escape from a black hole?\nEach is a puzzle that requires pieces from different parts of physics to solve. And after investigating these and other questions, you begin to see how all of physics is tied together in a system that is consistent, logical, beautiful, and often very surprising.\n\nFor example, the question about whether time travel is possible leads you to a study of the nature of time and space. The paradoxes you encounter there are directly related to Einstein's concepts of space-time and the constancy of the speed of light from his theory of relativity. This, in turn, takes you to exotic ideas such as black holes and wormholes, which some theorists believe may be potential shortcuts through space-time.\n\nBefore you know it, a staple subject of science fictionÃ¢â‚¬â€time travelÃ¢â‚¬â€has taken you through many layers of investigation to reveal profound truths about the universe.\n\nImpossible: Physics beyond the Edge uses this ingenious approach in 24 delightful half-hour lectures that will entertain and nourish your mind, while teaching you more physics than you ever imagined. Your guide into the realms of the impossible is veteran Great Courses Professor Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College, a pioneering theorist in quantum information, which is a field dealing with things once deemed impossible.&quot;\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n24 Lectures \n30 minutes / lecture\n\nFrom Principles to Paradoxes and Back Again\nAlmost Impossible\nPerpetual Motion\nOn Sunshine and Invisible Particles\nReflections on the Motive Power of Fire\nMaxwell's Demon\nAbsolute Zero\nPredicting the Future\nVisiting the Past\nThinking in Space-Time\nFaster than Light\nBlack Holes and Curved Space-Time\nA Spinning Universe, Wormholes, and Such\nWhat Is Symmetry?\nMirror Worlds\nInvasion of the Giant Insects\nThe Curious Quantum World\nImpossible Exactness\nQuantum Tunneling\nWhatever Is Not Forbidden Is Compulsory\nEntanglement and Quantum Cloning\nGeometry and Conservation\nSymmetry, Information, and Probability\nThe Future of the Impossible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50e8b30f12883e07442b42c4acb209773afe9f9","amp;dn":"TTC+Audio+-+Impossible%3A+Physics+beyond+the+Edge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50e8b30f12883e07442b42c4acb209773afe9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,14,139,48,241,40,131,224,116,66,180,44,74,203,32,151,115,175,233,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
