It features guitarist Randy Rhoads, who would later gain recognition for performing on Ozzy Osbourne's first two solo albums.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing it decades later, music critic Martin Popoff said that the album was more &quot;glam pop&quot; than hard rock or glam rock.\r\n\r\nThe song &quot;Back to the Coast&quot; was originally written by Rhoads and his brother Kelle when they were teenagers. It was originally called &quot;West Coast Tryouts&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis is a great item to have if you are a Randy Rhoads fan like I am. The playing isn't quite like the Ozzy years, for which Randy became famous, but if you listen you can hear some of his brilliance on some of the tracks.  Hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\nTracks\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;It's Not So Funny&quot;   \t\r\n2. \t&quot;Mama's Little Angels&quot;   \t\r\n3. \t&quot;Tin Soldier&quot; (Small Faces cover) \t\r\n4. \t&quot;Ravers&quot;   \t\r\n5. \t&quot;Back to the Coast&quot;   \t\r\n6. \t&quot;Glad All Over&quot; (Dave Clark Five cover) \t\r\n7. \t&quot;Get Your Kicks&quot;   \t\r\n8. \t&quot;Look in Any Window&quot;   \t\r\n9. \t&quot;Just How You Want It&quot;   \t\r\n10. \t&quot;Riot Reunion&quot;   \t\r\n11. \t&quot;Fit to Be Tied&quot;   \t\r\n12. \t&quot;Demolition Derby&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca96c804c1841f607508d0644b2ffdae887197e3","amp;dn":"Quiet+Riot+-+Quiet+Riot+1+%28w-Randy+Rhoads%29+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca96c804c1841f607508d0644b2ffdae887197e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,150,200,4,193,132,31,96,117,8,208,100,75,47,253,174,136,113,151,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
