In &quot;Lost Treasures of Tibet,&quot; NOVA goes behind the scenes with the first conservation team from the West, as it undertakes the painstaking restoration of these ancient masterpieces and the beautiful monasteries that house them. \nLocated in present-day Nepal, Mustang contains some of the last remaining relics of an almost vanished world of ancient Buddhist culture. Across the border in Tibet, Chinese occupiers have destroyed thousands of monasteries since taking control of the country in 1950. Therefore, the survival of Mustang's monasteries or gompas is more important than ever. But preservation is extremely difficult because of the centuries of neglect, weather, and earthquakes that have brought many buildings to the brink of collapse. Inside, their exquisite murals are in a near-ruined state. \nIn the course of their restoration work, conservators from the West come face-to-face with a thorny problem of culture clash: local people want missing sections of the murals completed. Westerners are aghast at the idea, but their hosts are equally shocked at the thought of worshiping unfinished deities.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8403/losttreasuresoftibetscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1813 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 54mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size:746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tibet/about.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tibet/about.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6afdeb3b421df0c0ae65c5bc84d8a15ac820ed","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+Lost+Treasures+of+Tibet+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6afdeb3b421df0c0ae65c5bc84d8a15ac820ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,106,253,235,59,66,29,240,192,174,101,197,188,132,216,161,90,200,32,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
