Focusing on a vast cast of characters -- from Dutch civilians to British and American strategists to common soldiers and commanders -- Ryan brings to life one of the most daring and ill-fated operations of the war. A Bridge Too Far superbly recreates the terror and suspense, the heroism and tragedy of this epic operation, which ended in bitter defeat for the Allies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7990189c25c06f40d36d7fa4289b82c0bc9a19ff","amp;dn":"A+Bridge+Too+Far%3A+The+Classic+History+of+the+Greatest+Battle+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7990189c25c06f40d36d7fa4289b82c0bc9a19ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,144,24,156,37,192,111,64,211,109,127,164,40,155,130,192,188,154,25,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
