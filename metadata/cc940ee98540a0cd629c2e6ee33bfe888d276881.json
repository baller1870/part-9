Stewart retains the focus on problem solving and the pedagogical system that has made the book a favorite of students and instructors in a wide variety of colleges and universities throughout the world. In this Fifth Edition, he has made hundreds of small improvements: new examples, additional steps in existing examples, updating of data in existing examples and exercises, new phrases and margin notes to clarify the exposition, references to other sources and web sites, redrawn art, and references to the TEC CD (Tools for Enriching Calculus). These refinements ensure that students and instructors have the best materials available. The number of pages in the book, however, remains unchanged from the 4th edition. Further support for students and instructors is now available through a vast array of supplementary material.\n\nAbout the Author\nJames Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford. Stewart is currently a Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University.

James Stewart is the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Brooks/Cole, including CALCULUS, Fifth Edition and CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, Fifth Edition, as well as a series of precalculus texts.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 1368 pages\nPublisher: Brooks Cole; 5th edition (December 24, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 053439339X\nISBN-13: 978-0534393397","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc940ee98540a0cd629c2e6ee33bfe888d276881","amp;dn":"Calculus+5th+Edition+by+James+Stewart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc940ee98540a0cd629c2e6ee33bfe888d276881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,148,14,233,133,64,160,205,98,156,46,110,227,59,254,136,141,39,104,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
