More than\n     25 years after its release, the time has come to rediscover a sound\n     that has extensively contributed to the history of music...\n     \n     In 1976, Yamaha introduced the CS-80. The price tag ($6,900) put it\n     out of reach of most musicians, and the weight (220 lbs or 100 kg)\n     made it sometimes hard to use on the stage...But the qualities of the\n     CS-80, considered as Japans first great synthesizer, made it\n     immediately famous in the music industry.\n     The CS-80 was popularised in the late 70's and early 80's by artists\n     and groups like Toto, Jean-Michel Jarre, Keith Emerson, Stevie Wonder\n     or Vangelis, who helped to turn this synthesizer into a real myth. \n     \n     The CS-80V offers all the features of the original synth, plus a new\n     generation of innovative features, taking the original design to a new\n     elevated level: \n     \n     * A modulation matrix \n     * A multitimbral mode \n     * An arpeggiator and a stereo delay \n     \n     But is the sound of the CS-80V really close to the original? We would\n     tend to say yes, as the synthesizer is based on TAE, the proprietary\n     technology developed by Arturia, and already successfully used in the\n     Moog Modular V.\n     \n\n     CS-80V 1.6 - What's new\n     \n     * Universal Binary support \n     * Vst 2.4  Cubase 4 ready \n     * Factory presets have been checked and re-tuned \n     * A new installer, regrouping all previous updates \n     * Bug fix: better Pro Tools integration \n     \n     \n     Required Configuration:\n     \n     PC :\n     Pentium II 500 MHz, 128 MB of RAM, Windows 9x/2000/ME/XP\n      \n     MAC :\n     G3 500 MHz, 128 MB of RAM, MacOS 9.x, Mac OS X 10.2\n      \n     Sound Card :\n     Any sound card compatible with DirectX, ASIO, SoundManager or\n     CoreAudio\n      \n     \n     A 260-paged paper manual is provided in 3 languages: French, English\n     and Japanese.\n     \n     Copy protection: the installation CD is only required each time you\n     want to import new banks of presets or when you install an update\n     patch of the product.\n     \n     \n     NOTE: Special Thanks goes to TEAM BEAT that generated the Serial \n           Number for this release.
