There she stumbles upon the discovery of her life - a treasure trove of ancient Scots-Irish ballads, songs that have been handed down from generation to generation, preserved intact by the seclusion of the mountains. With the goal of securing her promotion, Lily ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted - not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions. \n\n\n\n\nAspect ratio\n1.85 : 1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f96e159f3f92459c7e54f2022de5531c94129fa","amp;dn":"Songcatcher+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f96e159f3f92459c7e54f2022de5531c94129fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,150,225,89,243,249,36,89,199,229,79,32,34,222,85,49,201,65,41,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
