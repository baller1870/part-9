Covers the inelastic design spectrum to structural design; energy dissipation devices; Eurocode; theory of dynamic response of structures; structural dynamics theory; and more. Ideal for readers interested in Dynamics of Structures and Earthquake Engineering.\n\nThe publisher, Prentice-Hall Engineering/Science/Mathematics\nThis structures text places emphasis on earthquake analysis and response and design of structures. It omits non- essential and advanced topics including variational formulation of the equations of motion-Larange\\\\\\&amp;#039;s equations, finite element method for continua, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f5e2eb6f9a9548390cb88207c6e9a1ca5cd4a29","amp;dn":"Anil+K.+Chopra+-+Dynamics+of+Structures+-+Theory+and+Application","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f5e2eb6f9a9548390cb88207c6e9a1ca5cd4a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,94,46,182,249,169,84,131,144,203,136,32,124,110,154,28,165,205,74,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
