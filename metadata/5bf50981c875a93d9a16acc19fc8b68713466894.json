At the piano, Monk thrills with his use of unique tone clusters and devil-may-care keyboard rants. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always a high level of energy, even though the tempo varies from a slow and deliberate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPannonicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to a jumpinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and jivinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn Walked Bud.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jon Hendricks parades both lyrics and scat singing proudly around the classic tune.\nDisc Two combines big bands in both studio and live sessions with solo piano and quartet segments in concert. MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s piano work stands apart as powerfully percussive and full of vigor. The take presented here of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with studio big band swings with passion and heats up considerably. Soloist Rouse is in fine form. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a different take than that released in 1994 on the CD reissue of MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues. From a 1967 solo piano concert performance in Puebla, Mexico, Monk performs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Blame MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with deliberately slow and meaningful expression. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Mean YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is from ColumbiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 1963 LP Big Band And Quartet In Concert, also released on CD in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢94 by Sony. Thad Jones, Charlie Rouse, Frankie Dunlop and Phil Woods contribute exciting solos alongside MonkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fresh performance.\nDisc Three offers live Monk performances in concert and club settings, with both small and large ensembles. At the Newport Jazz Festival with Pee Wee Russell, and at the Monterey Jazz Festival with a nonet, Monk and Rouse swing heartily. In Stockholm, Monk is with a small ensemble that includes Johnny Griffin, Phil Woods and Ray Copeland. At the It club in Los Angeles, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in vintage form with Rouse, Larry Gales and Ben Riley.\n\nDisc  1:\n01 - Monk Speaks\n02 - Bye-Ya\n03 - Coming On The Hudson\n04 - Rhythm-A-Ning\n05 - Think Of One\n06 - Pannonica\n07 - Crepuscule With Nellie\n08 - April In Paris\n09 - Ugly Beauty\n10 - Honeysuckle Rose\n11 - In Walked Bud\n12 - Thelonious\n\n\nDisc  2:\n01 - Reflections\n02 - Blue Monk\n03 - 'Round Midnight\n04 - Dinah\n05 - Ask Me Now\n06 - Ruby, My Dear\n07 - Don't Blame Me\n08 - (When It's) Darkness On The Delta\n09 - Played Twice\n10 - I Mean You\n11 - Bemsha Swing\n12 - Jackie-ing\n\n\nDisc  3:\n01 - Nutty\n02 - Straight, No Chaser\n03 - Evidence\n04 - Epistrophy\n05 - Well, You Needn't\n06 - Misterioso\n07 - Hackensack\n08 - Bright Mississippi\nPersonnel: Thelonious Monk- piano; Pee Wee Russell- clarinet; Steve Lacy- soprano saxophone; Phil Woods- alto saxophone, clarinet; Buddy Collette- alto saxophone, other reeds; Ernie Watts, Gene Cipriano- alto saxophone; Johnny Griffin, Tom Scott, Charlie Rouse- tenor saxophone; Jack Nimitz, Ernie Small- baritone saxophone; Gene Allen- baritone saxophone, clarinet, bass clarinet; Thad Jones- cornet; Nick Travis, Bobby Bryant, Conte Candoli, Freddie Hill, Melvin Moore, Ray Copeland- trumpet; Eddie Bert, Lou Blackburn, Bob Brookmeyer, Billy Byers, Mike Wimberly, Jimmy Cleveland- trombone; John Ore, Butch Warren, Steve Swallow, Larry Gales- bass; Frankie Dunlop, John Guerin, Ben Riley- drums; Howard Roberts- guitar\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf50981c875a93d9a16acc19fc8b68713466894","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk++Monk+The+Columbia+Years+%281962-1968+%29%28jazz%29%28+3CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf50981c875a93d9a16acc19fc8b68713466894","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,245,9,129,200,117,169,61,154,22,172,193,159,200,182,135,19,70,104,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
