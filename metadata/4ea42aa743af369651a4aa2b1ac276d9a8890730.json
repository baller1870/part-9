Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.\r\n\r\nWritten by: Malcolm Gladwell\r\nNarrated by: Malcolm Gladwell\r\nLength: 8 hrs and 38 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea42aa743af369651a4aa2b1ac276d9a8890730","amp;dn":"The+Tipping+Point+-+Malcolm+Gladwell+%28Unabridged+Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea42aa743af369651a4aa2b1ac276d9a8890730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,164,42,167,67,175,54,150,81,164,170,43,26,194,118,217,168,137,7,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
