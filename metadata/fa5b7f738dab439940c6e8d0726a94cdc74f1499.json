Radio 4 Extra Classic Serial\nAdapted by Amber Lone\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p01l64v8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p01l64v8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe ancient Indian epic The Ramayana is one of the world's most popular love stories. The separation and reunion of two lovers gives it perennial appeal but Rama's jealousy and Sita 's metamorphosis into a strong independent woman gives the story a contemporary feel. &quot;Be as Rama,&quot; young Indians have been taught for 2,000 years, &quot;be as Sita.&quot; but Rama is an interestingly flawed character, driven by powerful emotions in a world where monkeys can be gods, and gods can be as fallible as humans. Amber Lone's modern version of this Indian epic is scheduled to coincide with Divali, the festival of Lights, which celebrates Rama and Sita's return to their kingdom. Outstanding composer Niraj Chag creates original music.\n\nAmber Lone (dramatist) is a bold new British Asian voice. She has had three acclaimed plays at Birmingham Rep: Paradise (2003), Deadeye(2006) &amp; Four Streets (2009). She was a regular writer on Silver Street for BBC Asian network.\n\nNiraj Chag (composer) wrote original music for the R4 dramatisation of The Mahabharata and a witty score for Rafta Rafta at the National Theatre. He is currently working on the feature film of Rafta Rafta .
