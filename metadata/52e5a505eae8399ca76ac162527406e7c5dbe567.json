Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Hung Up&quot;, and &quot;4 Minutes&quot;. Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.\n\nHer career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation.\n\nMadonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female artist in the United States, behind Barbra Streisand, with 64 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard chart. She was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the same year. Considered to be one of the &quot;25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century&quot; by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Blue  1986\n\n\nTrue Blue is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on June 30, 1986, by Sire Records. Madonna worked with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard on the album while co-writing all the songs. Deemed as Madonna's most girlish album, True Blue deals with her visions of love, work, dreams as well as disappointments, and was inspired by her then husband Sean Penn, to whom Madonna dedicated the album. Musically, the songs on the album took a different direction from her previous endeavours, incorporating classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.\n\nTrue Blue features instrumentation from acoustic guitars, drums, synthesizers and Cuban musical instruments. The topic for the songs range from love, freedom, and in the case of &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, social issues like teenage pregnancy. After its release, True Blue received generally positive reviews from critics. They complimented the album, with one calling it great dance-pop, and described it as the archetype of the late '80s and early '90s pop albums. They also praised the fact that Madonna's voice sounded stronger than it did on her previous efforts, while commending Madonna's skills as a singer, songwriter and entertainer.\n\nCommercially, True Blue became an international success, reaching the top of the charts in 28 countries, an unprecedented achievement at that time. It also became the world's top-selling album of 1986. Worldwide sales of the album stand at 24 million copies, seven million of those being sold in United States, which earned it a seven times platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Five singles were released from the album: &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, which went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, which reached the top-five.\n\nWith the singles and their accompanying music videos Madonna began to change her image from that of a &quot;boy-toy&quot; to a more sophisticated and matured look. For &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;, some social groups condemned Madonna for encouraging teenage pregnancy while others complimented her for her seemingly pro-life stance. &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; faced criticism for its music video, which portrayed a minor entering a strip club. During the 2006 Confessions Tour the live performance of &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, which featured Madonna performing the song while hanging from a cross and wearing a crown of thorns, generated media uproar with religious groups condemning it as blasphemy. True Blue is credited as being the album which made Madonna into a superstar.[2] It ensured Madonna's place among the musical artists of the '80s.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Open Your Heart&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;White Heat&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Live to Tell&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Where's the Party&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;True Blue&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot;\n\n\n\n2001 Remastered Version Bonus Tracks: \n\n\n\n10.\t&quot;True Blue&quot; (The Color Mix)\n11.\t&quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; (Extended Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e5a505eae8399ca76ac162527406e7c5dbe567","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+True+Blue+1986+%28Remastered+2001%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e5a505eae8399ca76ac162527406e7c5dbe567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,229,165,5,234,232,57,156,167,106,193,98,82,116,6,231,197,219,229,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
