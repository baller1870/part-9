Dinky ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» Time To Lose It\n\n\n        Release Notes:\n        ______________________________________________________________________________\n\n        The Lab, NRK's mix series devoted to the world's most cutting edge\n        DJs and forward thinking sounds, returns this Autumn with an\n        instalment compiled and mixed by undoubtedly one of the scene's most\n        talented, charismatic and brightest stars.\n\n        Hailing from the suburbs of Detroit, Seth Troxler has made an\n        incredible journey over the last few years, from the local DJ spots\n        at DetroitÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s The Works club and behind the counter service at the\n        famous Melodies &amp; Memories record store, to the most top drawer\n        nights and clubs across the world, such as Fabric, Panorama Bar,\n        DC10, The Rex et al. With a youthful enthusiasm and leftfield charm,\n        Seth has become a huge favourite of clubbers and party freaks, so\n        much so that he was voted the 3rd most popular DJ in Resident\n        Advisor's poll for 2010. But behind the public perception of\n        Troxler, he is seriously dedicated and passionate about quality\n        underground electronic music, taking giant leaps with his latest\n        Visionquest project, a collective of friends and fellow artists such\n        as Ryan Crosson, Shaun Reeves and Lee Curtis. His productions and\n        collaborations with esteemed artists like Deetron, Matthew Dear and\n        Tiefschwarz, and labels like Crosstown Rebels, Circus Company, Wolf\n        &amp; Lamb and Wagon Repair show an artist deeply in tune with the\n        cutting edge electronic music that endeavours to push the envelopes\n        of dance music.\n\n        It may be a cliche, but Troxler's The Lab definitely has to be heard\n        to be believed, his talents are evident as he effortlessly blends\n        many different styles but always keeping a strong continuity and\n        sounding like no other DJ on the planet right now.\n\n        And so onto the music, and it is here that Troxler really excels on\n        this double mix project. Disc One is a decidedly deep affair,\n        opening up with the smooth and atmospheric sounds of Hatikvan and\n        Bearweasel, before finding a solid and luscious groove with tracks\n        from David Alvarado, Lindstrom, Tommy Bones and Dinky.  The vibe\n        starts to get a little freaky with the classic DBX/Moritz Von Oswald\n        collaboration 'City On the Edge Of Forever' which in turn sends the\n        mix journey to more minimal experimentation and a tougher mood,\n        ushering in some great music from Daze Maxim, DJ Qu and David\n        Durango and closing the half with the psychedelic sounds of\n        Masomenos.\n\n        Disc Two picks up right where the first left off, and a little skit\n        featuring techno legend Kenny Larkin captured on a telephone call\n        introduces a mind boggling segue of tracks that effortlessly  blends\n        ultra deep minimalism, dubby low slung vocal tracks, freeform jazz\n        workouts, otherworldly and psychedelic electronics and cowboys &amp;\n        Indians inspired tech-house (check Und's Rodeo, truly magnificent\n        fun!).  Amongst the forward thinking producers featured here include\n        Ricardo Villalobos &amp; Martin, Deniz Kurtel, Oni Ayhun and Ryan\n        Crosson.  Disc Two is probably where Troxler would position himself\n        in, say , a DC10 Ibiza set, and the music gets bigger and more\n        panoramic as the mix takes in some immense music from Dinky,\n        Lawrence, Chaim and Superpitcher.  The set ends suitably with a rare\n        Andrew Weatherall mix of Radioactive Man, and a superb, as yet\n        unreleased, Visionquest new signing from Dinky.\n\n        Troxler truly adopts the brief of The Lab, and experiments with many\n        records, creating a thing of beauty and definitely a mix that will\n        stand the test of time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2606ffa174f4fa9e1b894ba6e3310b637eb3d8","amp;dn":"VA-The_Lab_03_%28Mixed_by_Seth_Troxler%29-2CD-2011-iHF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe2606ffa174f4fa9e1b894ba6e3310b637eb3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,38,6,255,161,116,244,250,158,27,137,75,166,227,49,11,99,126,179,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
