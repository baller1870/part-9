His victory over Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815 altered the course of history. The hero of Waterloo became a towering figure in British history for both his achievements and for embodying our notions of Britishness - the stiff upper lip, unfussy straightforwardness and incorruptibility in office - he was the Iron Duke.\n\nThis drama documentary looks behind the iron mask to focus on the intriguing complexities of the Duke of Wellington - his character, personality and relationships, told through his own words and the words of those who knew him best. General, politician, lover, outsider - the series discovers that the hero of Waterloo was far more complex than his public image.\n\nDrawing on his own vast private correspondence, as well as the diaries and memoirs of those around him, this biographical series uses dramatic reconstruction to create an intimate portrait of the Duke of Wellington, played by Richard E Grant (Withnail and I, The Iron Lady, Doctor Who). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vlz90&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vlz90&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n \nWellington - The Iron Duke Unmasked\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Wellington - The Iron Duke Unmasked.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 11s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 653 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 11s\nBitrate                     : 1 401 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.187\nStream size                 : 593 MB (85%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 11s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 239 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 101 MB (14%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 491 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 19.7 --abr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e6d59033cb2742a65fd95fcd7d4b5c6e3e9ac9","amp;dn":"Wellington+-+The+Iron+Duke+Unmasked+-+History+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60e6d59033cb2742a65fd95fcd7d4b5c6e3e9ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,230,213,144,51,203,39,66,166,95,217,95,205,125,75,92,110,62,154,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
