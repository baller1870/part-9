You couldn't lodge that one against this set with a straight face; if anything, somebody turned Sonny Terry loose. It didn't hurt that Johnny Winter was around on guitar and piano, playing gritty blues with a passion. It didn't help that Terry didn't put any amplified muscle behind his harmonica, however. Otherwise, this is a strong session.\n\n\nTracks:\n1. I Got My Eyes On You\n2. Sonny's Whoopin' The Doop\n3. Burnt Child\n4. Whoo Wee Baby\n5. Crow Jane\n6. So Tough With Me\n7. Whoo Wee Baby\n8. I Think I Got the Blues\n9. Ya, Ya\n10. Roll Me, Baby\n\n\nLineup:\nSonny Terry - Harmonica, vocals\nJohnny Winter - Guitar, piano\nWillie Dixon - Bass\nStyve Homnick - Drums\n\n\n*** R.I.P. Johnny ***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2087d98125b8d410cd04387304864e63a5ddeac","amp;dn":"Sonny+Terry+with+Johnny+Winter+and+Willie+Dixon+-+%5B1984%5D+Whoppin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2087d98125b8d410cd04387304864e63a5ddeac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,8,125,152,18,91,141,65,12,208,67,135,48,72,100,230,58,93,222,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
