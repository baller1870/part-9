Bandits are nearby, torturing and killing the survivors. El Topo rescues a woman (Mara), who leads him on a mission to find and defeat the four master gunmen of the desert. Leaving his son with a group of monks, El Topo and Mara complete the mission, accompanied by a mysterious woman in black. The women leave El Topo wounded in the desert, where he is found by a clan of deformed people who take him to the remote cavern where they live. Awakening years later, he goes with a dwarf woman to a nearby town, promising to dig a tunnel through which the cave-dwellers can escape. They find the town run by a vicious sheriff and home to a bizarre religious cult. El Topo's son, now a man, is a monk in the town. The completion of the tunnel leads El Topo, the townspeople, and the cave-dwellers to a bloody and tragic end.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4333148/El_Topo_(The_Mole)_(Alejandro_Jodorowsky__1970)_(PHS)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4333148/El_Topo_(The_Mole)_(Alejandro_Jodorowsky__1970)_(PHS)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNight Of The Living Dead (1968)\n\nChaos descends upon the world as the brains of the recently deceased become inexplicably reanimated, causing the dead to rise and feed on human flesh. Speculation rests on a radiation-covered NASA satellite returning from Venus, but it only remains a speculation. Anyone who dies during the crisis of causes unrelated to brain trauma will return as a flesh-eating zombie, including anyone who has been bitten by a zombie. The only way to destroy the zombies is to destroy the brain. As the catastrophe unfolds, a young woman visiting her father's grave takes refuge in a nearby farmhouse, where she is met by a man who protects her and barricades them inside. They both later discover people hiding in the basement, and they each attempt to cope with the situation. Their only hope rests on getting some gasoline from a nearby pump into a truck that is running on empty, but this requires braving the hordes of ravenous walking corpses outside. When they finally put their plans into action, panic and personal tensions only add to the terror as they try to survive.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4168812/Night_Of_The_Living_Dead_%5B1968_-_30th_Anniversary_Edition%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4168812/Night_Of_The_Living_Dead_%5B1968_-_30th_Anniversary_Edition%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Harder They Come (1972) \n\nA poor Jamaican, a 1970s anti-hero, tries to make it with a hit record but finds that payola rules.
