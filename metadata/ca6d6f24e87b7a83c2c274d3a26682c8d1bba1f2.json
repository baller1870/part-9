The idea was to not have any idea to keep myself confused about what I was doing,&quot; frontman Will Sheff says about Okkervil River's 2011 album. The resulting record, I Am Very Far, is a startling break from anything this band has done before. By turns terrifying and joyous, violent and serene, grotesque and romantic, it's a celebration of forces beyond our control. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6d6f24e87b7a83c2c274d3a26682c8d1bba1f2","amp;dn":"Okkervil+River+-+I+Am+Very+Far+%5Bmp3-256-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6d6f24e87b7a83c2c274d3a26682c8d1bba1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,109,111,36,232,123,122,131,194,194,116,211,162,102,130,200,209,187,161,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
