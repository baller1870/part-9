It is the first non-Discworld Pratchett novel since Johnny and the Bomb (1996). Pratchett took his editors by surprise by writing it before the previously scheduled Tiffany Aching conclusion. He has said &quot;I want to write this one so much I can taste it&quot;, and that he's been ready to do it for four years.\n\nPratchett said in February 2007, &quot;At the moment I'm just writing. If it needs to be Discworld it will be Discworld. It could be set in this world 150 years ago while still more or less being a fantasy. The codename for it is Nation.&quot; Nation is not set on the Discworld but in an alternate history of our world in the 1860s.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_(novel)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRead by Matt Addis and Charlie Norfolk.\n\n\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 01 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 02 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 03 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 04 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 05 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 06 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 07 of 08\nTerry Pratchett's - Nation - 08 of 08\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61696e4c364bb295a8470de663675390d6c8f97d","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett%5C%27s+-+Nation+-+AudioBook+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61696e4c364bb295a8470de663675390d6c8f97d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,105,110,76,54,75,178,149,168,71,13,230,99,103,83,144,214,200,249,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
