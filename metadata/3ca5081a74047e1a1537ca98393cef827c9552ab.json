The recording was never released. Ironically, Laetitia Sadier recorded the same cover with Luna in 1995. \n \nThe quality is not great, but this is the best recording that I'm aware of. MP3 format.\n\nThanks,\nZombieAgent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca5081a74047e1a1537ca98393cef827c9552ab","amp;dn":"Bonnie+%26amp%3B+Clyde+-+Stereolab+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca5081a74047e1a1537ca98393cef827c9552ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,165,8,26,116,4,126,26,21,55,202,152,57,60,239,130,124,149,82,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
