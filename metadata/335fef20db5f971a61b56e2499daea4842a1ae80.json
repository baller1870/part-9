Despite its uncharacteristically mainstream sound the album failed to chart. Many observers consider the album to be the Captain's weakest work, leading fans to christen the line-up of the period the 'Tragic Band'.\n\nThe album does, however, have its influence: an early White Stripes EP entitled Party of Special Things to Do (2001) contains three Beefheart covers, including this album's opening track.\n\nHaving no musical training or instrumental experience, throughout his career Van Vliet had relied on a musical director within the band who could translate his often unorthodox ideas into a form that was musically playable. This role had been successively filled by Alex St. Clair, John French, and Bill Harkleroad on his previous albums. With the entire Magic Band having quit after the recording of his previous album he no longer had such an intermediary. As a result the album is generally considered the nadir of Van Vliet's musical career. One of the musicians, Michael Smotherman, said &quot;Don was just as confused as he could be throughout the whole process... I would push his face up to the microphone and he would start singing. And when it was time to stop I would pull him back gently.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCaptain Beefheart - vocals, harmonica\nDean Smith - guitar, bottleneck guitar\nIra Ingber - bass\nBob West - bass\nMichael Smotherman - keyboards, backing vocals\nMark Gibbons - keyboards\nGene Pello - drums\nJimmy Caravan - keyboard, star machine\nTy Grimes - percussion\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Party of Special Things to Do&quot; (Don Van Vliet, Elliot Ingber) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n2.&quot;Same Old Blues&quot; (J.
