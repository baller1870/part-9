It still sounds totally modern and very new \nand fresh, in style and vision. \n\nThe guitarist and drummer are so amazingly skilled, crafting unpredictable riffs \nand tunes, even so it is still and hugely catchy rockin album with great deep \nmeaning, lyrics themes and vision. Fantasic stuff. \n\nI very rarely give a 5-star rating to anything, but this is Kings Xs finest hour \nand this really is a truly special album. \nTimeless songwriting, excellent musicianship, enough soul and feeling to last the \naverage listener a lifetime and it always sounds fresh every time you go back to it.\n \nIt showcases Kings Xs ability to draw together an eclectic mix of styles, you will \nnot be disappointed.\n\nOn Gretchen Goes to Nebraska theres more of that pumping rock sound, but with a little \nmore sophistication, particularly on the vocals. \nThe melodies are catchy but not &quot;poppy&quot; and the harmonies are especially complex. \n\nThe band were showing more sophistication in their song writing, musically as well as \nlyrically, and this is demonstrated in a tighter feel to the production.\n \nFor me, this is Kings X at their creative best, and while subsequent Atlantic releases \nfollow in the same vein as this album, they dont have the edge that this recording does. \n\nTop tracks include; Over my Head, Summerland and Pleides.\n___________\n\n 1.
