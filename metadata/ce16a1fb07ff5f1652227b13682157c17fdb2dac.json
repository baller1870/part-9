But way back, I was trying to get all the Studio Ghibli movies in English in one single torrent and it was much harder than it should have been, so I downloaded all of them and compiled them into this one convenient torrent. *This torrent includes all of the films except the two most recently released*\n\n0. NausicaÃƒÂ¤ of the Valley of the Wind\n1. Castle in the Sky\n2. Grave of the Fireflies\n3. My Neighbor Totoro\n4. Kiki's Delivery Service\n5. Only Yesterday (Note: this is the only one not in English, due to the fact that it was never dubbed)\n6. Porco Rosso\n7. Pom Poko\n8. Whisper of the Heart\n9. Princess Mononoke\n10. My Neighbors the Yamadas\n11. Spirited Away\n12. The Cat Returns\n13. Howl's Moving Castle\n14. Tales from Earthsea\n15. Ponyo\n16. Arriety\n17. From Up on Poppy Hill\n\nI do apologize that they are of varying file types, but as long as you use VLC that shouldn't be a problem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce16a1fb07ff5f1652227b13682157c17fdb2dac","amp;dn":"Studio+Ghibli+English+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce16a1fb07ff5f1652227b13682157c17fdb2dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,22,161,251,7,255,95,22,82,34,123,19,104,33,87,193,127,219,45,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
