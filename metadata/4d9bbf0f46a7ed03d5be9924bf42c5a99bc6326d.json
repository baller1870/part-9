He records and tours with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey.[2]\n\nSpringsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band perform intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories.\n\nHis most successful studio albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life in America, and the latter album made him one of the most recognized artists of the 1980s within the United States. A Democrat, his support for the presidential campaigns of Senator John Kerry and President Barack Obama have caused Springsteen and his music to become identified with modern American liberalism.[3] He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11 attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.[4]\n\nHe has earned numerous awards for his work, including twenty Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award, and continues to have a strong global fan base. He has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and 120 million worldwide.[5] He was a 2009 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential 2003\n\n\nThe Essential Bruce Springsteen is a compilation album by Bruce Springsteen, released on 11 November 2003. The collection is part of a series of Essential sets released by Sony BMG (previously Sony Music Entertainment). Per liner notes comments by Springsteen, the collection was intended as an introduction to his music for new fans who attended shows on The Rising Tour; hence, it includes songs from every Springsteen album since his debut. The album was available as a 2-disc set and, later, as a limited edition 3-disc set; for the latter, the third disc contained a selection of rarities and previously unreleased recordings.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart on November 29, 2003 at number 14, with sales of 90,000 copies. It spent 13 weeks on the chart. The album was awarded certified gold and platinum records on December 16, 2003 by the RIAA. The Essential Bruce Springsteen also reached #28 in UK albums chart.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\n\nDisc one\n\n1.\t&quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;\n2.\t&quot;For You&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Spirit in the Night&quot;\n4.\t&quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Thunder Road&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Born to Run&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Jungleland&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Badlands&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;\n11.\t&quot;The Promised Land&quot;\n12.\t&quot;The River&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Hungry Heart&quot;\n14.\t&quot;Nebraska&quot;\n15.\t&quot;Atlantic City&quot;\n\n\n\n\nDisc two \n\n1.\t&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Glory Days&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;\n4.\t&quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Human Touch&quot;\n7.\t&quot;Living Proof&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Lucky Town&quot;\n9.\t&quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;\n10.\t&quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;\n11.\t&quot;The Rising&quot;\n12.\t&quot;Mary's Place&quot;\n13.\t&quot;Lonesome Day&quot;\n14.\t&quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot; (Live at Madison Square Garden)\n15.\t&quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; (Live at Madison Square Garden)\n\n\n\n\n\nDisc three (Limited editon) \n\n1.\t&quot;From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)&quot; \no\tRecorded in 1979, at the Power Station; also recorded by Dave Edmunds on 1982 release DE 7th\n2.\t&quot;The Big Payback&quot; \no\tHome recording made shortly after Nebraska sessions\n3.\t&quot;Held Up Without a Gun&quot; (Live) \no\tRecorded live December 31, 1980 at Nassau Coliseum during The River Tour\n4.\t&quot;Trapped&quot; (Live) \no\tJimmy Cliff song, recorded live August 6, 1984 at Meadowlands Arena on the Born in the U.S.A.
