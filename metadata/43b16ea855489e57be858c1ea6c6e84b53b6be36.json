The album was officially announced in 22 October 2013 by the band's frontman, Thomas Gabriel Fischer (a.k.a. &quot;Tom Warrior&quot;), on his official blog.[1]\n\nThe title is in Greek (ÃŽÅ“ÃŽÂµÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ±ÃŽÂ½ÃŽÂ¬ ÃŽÂ§ÃŽÂ±ÃÆ’ÃŽÂ¼ÃŽÂ±Ãâ€žÃŽÂ±) and, according to Fischer, it can be roughly translated as &quot;black, deep depressions/valleys&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ or, in a more literal translation, &quot;chasms as [black as] ink&quot;.\n\nThe album's artwork was provided by famous Surrealist painter H. R. Giger. It is the third time in his career he has collaborated with Thomas Fischer; Giger also provided artwork for Fischer's former band Celtic Frost's first full-length, To Mega Therion, in 1985, and to Triptykon's debut Eparistera Daimones in 2010.\n\n\nCHECK THIS OUT TOO:\n\nALBA SAVAGE - Alba Savage (digital EP)\nDISSIDIUM - Dance Macabre CD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b16ea855489e57be858c1ea6c6e84b53b6be36","amp;dn":"TRIPTYKON+-+Malena+Chasmata+%28CD+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b16ea855489e57be858c1ea6c6e84b53b6be36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,177,110,168,85,72,158,87,190,133,140,30,166,198,232,75,83,182,190,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
