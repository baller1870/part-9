Some are of them were real - some are altered into pure Legend. These legends usually had somebody doing villainous deeds. The even greater thing is that most of these were surrounded in mystery or conspiracy.\r\nMedieval Murder Mysteries uses modern thinking from historical police criminology combined with forensics and human osteologists blended with current historical ideas to try and solve what really happened all those years ago. Magnificent castles, chivalrous knights, powerful kings and queens? You'll have them. Also require dark deeds, illicit lovers, greedy nobles, mad cardinals? Look no further. They're all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Christopher Marlowe: Death in Debtford \r\nThe untimely death in 1593 of Christopher Marlowe robbed English literature of one of its greatest dramatists - a man who mentored and influenced no lesser figure than William Shakespeare himself. But it wasn't illness or war that took Marlowe's life - it was violent, bloody murder done in circumstances and for reasons that still cause heated debate. Was Marlowe a spy, done away with by the authorities? Was he killed because of unpaid debts? Or because his plays were seen as Catholic propaganda by a fiercely Protestant regime? Was his death ordered to prevent him revealing that several Privy Councillors were atheists - a crime at the time? Or, most intriguingly, did he fake his own death? It's a fascinating story and we'll examine each theory on detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c6/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cb/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/07/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Medieval-Murder-Mysteries-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3155 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.historychannel.com.au/tv-shows/1919/medieval-murder-mysteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0aa23b315060d74c9907f5bfa6698210f097065","amp;dn":"Medieval+Murder+Mysteries+Series+1+1of6+Christopher+Marlowe+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0aa23b315060d74c9907f5bfa6698210f097065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,170,35,179,21,6,13,116,201,144,127,91,250,102,152,33,15,9,112,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
