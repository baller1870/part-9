The plot is based upon the actual exploits of New York City's 69th Infantry Regiment during World War I.\nThe regiment was first given that nickname by opposing General Robert E. Lee during the American Civil War.\n\nSeveral real-life personages depicted in The Fighting 69th include Father Francis P. Duffy, the chaplain, future OSS leader Wild Bill Donovan, the battalion commander, Lt. Oliver Ames, a platoon commander, and then-Sgt. Joyce Kilmer, the poet (Jeffrey Lynn).\n\nMost of The Fighting 69th was filmed at Warner Brothers' Calabasas Ranch location, which doubled as Camp Mills, the regiment's training base, various French villages, and numerous battlefields.\n\nCAST;-\nJames Cagney as Private Jerry Plunkett\nPat O'Brien as Father Francis P.

Ames (Dennis Morgan). The chaplain, Father Francis P. Duffy (Pat O'Brien) attempts to reform Plunkett. Sgt. Big Mike Wynn (Alan Hale, Sr.) loses both his brothers in action due to Plunkett's blunders. Major Donovan ultimately orders Plunkett to be court-martialed. Plunkett is nonetheless returned to duty, as the battalion again goes into the line. Shamed and inspired by Donovan's forbearance, Plunkett redeems himself by fighting bravely. Finally he sacrifices his life to protect his comrades by covering a grenade with his body.\n\nThe Fighting 69th is a First World War regiment of mostly New York-Irish soldiers. Amongst a cocky crew, perhaps the cockiest is Jerry Plunkett, a scrappy fellow who looks out only for himself. The officers and non-coms of the regiment do their best to instill discipline in Plunkett, and the chaplain, Father Duffy, tries to make Plunkett see the greater good, all to no avail. Behind the lines or in the trenches, Plunkett acts selfishly and cowardly, eventually costing the lives of many of his fellow soldiers. A final act of cowardice leads to terrible consequences, but Plunkett sees in them a chance to redeem himself...if only he can.\n\nWhile Jerry Plunkett was a fictional character, Father Duffy, Major Donovan, Lt. Ames, and Sgt. Joyce Kilmer were all real members of the 69th. Many of the events depicted (training at Camp Mills, the Mud March, dugout collapse at Rouge Bouquet, crossing the Ourcq River, Victory Parade, etc.) actually happened.\n\nJohn T. Prout, an Irish American, former Captain in the regiment and Irish Army general, was the movie's technical advisor.\nPriscilla Lane was initially cast as one of the soldiers' girls back home, but the part was cut prior to production. No female characters are seen in the film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1l0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1l0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1le&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1le&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1l4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1l4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/1lY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 251 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 90 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a552ef138d247db244be4ce9fcf492e93210bbe3","amp;dn":"The+Fighting+69th+%281940%29+DvdRip+Xvid+1cd+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a552ef138d247db244be4ce9fcf492e93210bbe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,82,239,19,141,36,125,178,68,190,76,233,252,244,146,233,50,16,187,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
