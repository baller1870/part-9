The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived withÃ¢â‚¬â€and perished fromÃ¢â‚¬â€for more than five thousand years.\n\nThe story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out Ã¢â‚¬Å“war against cancer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to MukherjeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to surviveÃ¢â‚¬â€and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease.\n\nRiveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Tantor; MP3 - Unabridged CD edition (November 17, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1400169178\nISBN-13: 978-1400169177\n\n_____________________________________\n                                                                                                                                                                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&lt;/a&gt;\n_____________________________________\n \n\nCome &amp; Join Suprbay, Post Requests, Suggestions &amp; Surf the TPB Forum. \n\n                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n__________________\n\n\nAnd, My Link On Suprbay:\n                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet me there. :)\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff86eefc7ad0d6cfcf34ca00354568e25d20af39","amp;dn":"The+Emperor+of+All+Maladies+By+Siddhartha+Mukherjee+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff86eefc7ad0d6cfcf34ca00354568e25d20af39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,134,238,252,122,208,214,207,207,52,202,0,53,69,104,226,93,32,175,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
