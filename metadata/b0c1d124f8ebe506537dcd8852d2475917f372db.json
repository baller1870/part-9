It went to #1 on the Billboard 200, becoming only the second EP to ever do so, following Alice In Chains' Jar of Flies in 1994\nThe CD contains six tracks, mashups between songs by both artists.\nThe DVD contains behind-the-scenes new footage of the making of the album, as well as the second take of all of the Collision Course songs at The Roxy Theatre on July 18, 2004. Also included are the five scenes from the concert shown on MTV Ultimate Mash-Ups and a picture gallery.\nThe album's first single, &quot;Numb/Encore&quot;, achieved great airplay on the charts, and stayed on 6 months after its release. &quot;Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step Closer&quot; was also released to the radio in the US, but was never featured on the Billboard Charts - the videos for both that track and &quot;Jigga What/Faint&quot; were also seen on Kerrang! TV in the UK. &quot;Izzo/In the End&quot; was also heavily promoted on the official Linkin Park websites.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nThe first question everyone asks about Collision Course is &quot;Is this album more Jay-Z or Linkin Park?&quot; The wrong answer is that it's Jay-Z with a loud band or a back-and-forth of covers where one rearranges the other. The right answer is that this CD/DVD set is quite possibly one of the best cross-genre pairings of its kind. What started off as an exercise at &quot;mashing&quot; a Linkin Park track with a Jay-Z track turned into a fantastic pickup game between two artists at the top of their worlds. Each brought a short list of their best songs to the field and walked away with a six-song trophy. This is recess in the supergroup sandbox, and the boys shared their toys. &quot;Numb/Encore&quot; and &quot;Izzo/In the End&quot; are near-perfect plays of seamless sonic moves and mic assists from heavy metal to hip-hop and back. Both artists have spent a little time in the other camp on various parts of their records, but it's the collaboration that makes this album a winner. It may be true that Linkin Park is less than convincing than J-Hova on &quot;Big Pimpin'/Papercut,&quot; but there's no evidence of &quot;I&quot; on this team. In fact, the DVD clearly shows Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda taking on the role of head coach as he commands the digital workstation, the mixing desk, and all the players with a collective spirit.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n[01] Dirt Off Your Shoulder - Lying From You\n[02] Big Pimpin' - Papercut\n[03] Jigga What - Faint\n[04] Numb - Encore\n[05] Izzo - In The End\n[06] Points Of Authority - 99 Problems - One Step Closer\n\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] Collision Course Concert [449mb] \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:21m:15s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 511mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.0.2.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- Mpeg\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop Rap Punk Rock\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 30 November 2004\n\nRecords Company    \t- Warner Reprise\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.jayzonline.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://linkinpark.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n===================================================================================\n\nNumb - Encore [CDS] - Jay-Z &amp; Linkin Park  [2004]\n\t\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Numb/Encore [Explicit Version]\n[02] Numb/Encore [Instrumental]\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:06m:55s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 19.6mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop Nu Metal Rap\n\nOriginally Released\t- 14 November 2004\n\nRecords Company    \t- Warner Reprise\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.jayzonline.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://linkinpark.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c1d124f8ebe506537dcd8852d2475917f372db","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+Collision+Course+-+Jay-Z+%26+Linkin+Park+-+531mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c1d124f8ebe506537dcd8852d2475917f372db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,193,209,36,248,235,229,6,83,125,205,136,82,210,71,89,23,243,114,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
