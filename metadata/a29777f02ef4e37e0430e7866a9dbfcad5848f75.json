From the Stone Age to \nthe information age, the undead have threatened to engulf the human race. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re coming. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hungry. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for them to come to you! This is the graphic novel the fans demanded: major zombie attacks from the dawn of humanity. On the African savannas, against the legions of ancient Rome, on the high seas with Francis Drake . . . every civilization has faced them. Here are the grisly and heroic storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€œcomplete with eye-popping artwork that pulsates with the hideous faces of the undead. Organize before they rise! Scripted by the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading zombie authority, Max Brooks, Recorded Attacks reveals how other eras and cultures have dealt withÃ¢â‚¬â€œand survivedÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe ancient viral plague. By immersing ourselves in past horror we may yet prevail over the coming outbreak in our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29777f02ef4e37e0430e7866a9dbfcad5848f75","amp;dn":"The+Zombie+Survival+Guide+-+Recorded+Attacks+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29777f02ef4e37e0430e7866a9dbfcad5848f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,151,119,240,46,244,227,126,4,48,231,134,106,157,191,202,213,132,143,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
