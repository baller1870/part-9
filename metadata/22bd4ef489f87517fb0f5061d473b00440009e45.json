The liner notes ought to have included more information on the tracks (for example, I would like to know where this superior version of the slinky &quot;Sly One&quot; came from, as it's not featured on the original 12&quot; -in fact most of the mixes are not named). Release dates would have been nice for the historian as well. But you'd be hard pressed to find this much fun packed into any other dance music history lesson.\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/vHBJC5E.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n\r\n01.
