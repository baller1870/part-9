In his first two years in the industry (1953 and 1954), Ditko drew tales of macabre suspense that were not yet hobbled by the imminent Comics Code Authority (adopted in October 1954). These stories featured graphic bloodshed, dismemberment and blood-curdling acid baths as the ugly end to the lives of the dark and twisted inhabitants of Steve DitkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s imagination.\n\nFollowing up on Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko, Blake BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2008 best-selling critical retrospective of DitkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, strange suspense, Strange Suspense: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 1 will, for the first time, feature spectacular full-color reprints of every story from those first two years of his career. Beginning with DitkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very first story to DitkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short stint in the Joe Simon/Jack Kirby studio, to DitkoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eventual encampment at the Charlton Comics operation in 1954, readers will see the initial works of an artist already at a level of craftsmanship that exceeded most of his peers. The book will also feature editor BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s insightful historical notes.&quot;\n\nThis digital copy is from Minutemen-InnerDemons, and looks fantastic. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ce7429ddc0f3b50b9292948826e3326acc641d","amp;dn":"Strange+Suspense+-The+Steve+Ditko+Archives+v01+%282009%7CD%7CMM-ID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ce7429ddc0f3b50b9292948826e3326acc641d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,206,116,41,221,192,243,181,11,146,146,148,136,38,227,50,106,204,100,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
