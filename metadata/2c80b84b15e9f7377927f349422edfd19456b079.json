Responding to the need for a flexible, yet systematic approach to designing thermal systems across such diverse fields, Design and Optimization of Thermal Systems, Second Edition provides hands-on guidance needed to solve practical and progressively complex design problems.\nThis bookoffers a thorough examination of basic concepts and procedures for conceptual design, formulation, modeling, simulation, feasible design, and optimization. The chapters encompass traditional as well as emerging techniques, featuring timely and compelling examples to demonstrate the range of potential problems and available solutions that readers may apply to their own needs.\n\nMaintaining its emphasis on mathematical modeling and simulation techniques, this revised edition offers extended coverage on manufacturability, material selection, and sensitivity. It includes new material on genetic and gradient search methods and highlights significant trends such as knowledge-based design methodology. This edition also updates and enhances its coverage of important economic, safety, security, and environmental aspects and considerations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c80b84b15e9f7377927f349422edfd19456b079","amp;dn":"Design+and+Optimization+of+Thermal+Systems+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c80b84b15e9f7377927f349422edfd19456b079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,128,184,75,21,233,247,55,121,39,243,73,66,46,223,209,148,86,176,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
