To re-establish his stature and save face, he decides to inveigle a group of petty thieves (led by an old acquaintance) to rob a bank. A reluctant captain provides Max intelligence and Max starts spending evenings with Lilly, a prostitute who's the girlfriend of the group's leader. He poses as a rich banker with money to burn and encourages Lilly to think about her future. He hints at a payroll that comes through his bank. The plot works, the petty thieves think they're ready for a big score, and the cops are in place. What could go wrong with Max's cold plan? Who's entrapped? \n\nEnglish and Spanish soft subs included.\n\nDVDrip\n\nFile Name ..........: Max et Les Ferrailleurs (1971).avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 1.312.562.180 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 1.281.799 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1.251,76 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 1.210.270.120 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 1.181.904 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 1.154,20 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:46:33\nVideo Codec Code ...: DX50\nVideo Codec Name ...: DivX 5.0 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1514 KB/s\nResolution .........: 664 x 400\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.66:1\nTotal Frames .......: 130951 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 24 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,278 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 102.288.000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 99.891 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 97,55 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:46:33\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:466374a28cc2abf62d640c3e0b8849b04e6689be","amp;dn":"Claude+Sautet+-+Max+and+the+Junkmen+%5BMax+et+les+ferrailleurs%5D+%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"466374a28cc2abf62d640c3e0b8849b04e6689be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,99,116,162,140,194,171,246,45,100,12,62,11,136,73,176,78,102,137,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
