All samples were lovingly hand crafted by the renowned New Zealand sample guru Goldbaby, and consist of 51 kits including drum and percussion samples as well as multi-sampled melodic synth sounds and dedicated pre-programmed patterns for each kit.\n\nGoldbaby Productions specialize in being purveyors of quality sample based instruments. For VINTAGE HEAT, classic machines such as the Roland TR-808 and EMU SP-12 as well as synths like the Juno-6 and Korg MS-20 were used as sound sources. The audio signal chain consists of well known studio standards such as the UBK Fatso and the Roland Space Echo, as well as collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s items such as an Ampex valve Ã‚Â½ inch tape machine from the legendary Ekadek studio. Also included are samples drawn direct from vinyl for that ultra-authentic groove. The result is a MASCHINE Expansion with tons of mojo - warm and phat sounds that are both instantly contemporary and soaked in vintage attitude. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31afe105bd3af8de6c7620b1d9d4bea27728958","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Vintage+Heat+%28Rev.2%29+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31afe105bd3af8de6c7620b1d9d4bea27728958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,26,254,16,91,211,175,141,230,199,98,11,29,157,75,234,39,114,137,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
