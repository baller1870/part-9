I saw De Lucia playing in a sort of compulsive manner (a jazz musician, some friend of mine, told me that Paco's always obsessively fingering the guitar, even when he's not performing). Di Meola was also perfect but equally tight as a tourniquet in the transmission of feelings - he seemed also slightly annoyed of the fans studying his technique under the stage.\nOn the other hand, the third unknown grey-haired, bespectacled man was there, playing and irradiating a pulse of warmth and energy.\nAnd he smiled as if he was doing something he really loved...\nSo for me Coryell was a matter of serendipity... :)\n\nYou will find here 118 albums, solo and collaborations (a big thanks to Crimhead420 who kindly provided me some very rare albums, difficult to find anywhere else :) )\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nfor private posts:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc1bd0afc72d5b3a64a83f2ac8356de8e5be692","amp;dn":"Larry+Coryell+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc1bd0afc72d5b3a64a83f2ac8356de8e5be692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,193,189,10,252,114,213,179,166,74,131,242,172,131,86,222,142,91,230,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
