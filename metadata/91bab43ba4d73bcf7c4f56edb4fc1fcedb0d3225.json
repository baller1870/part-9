They are the first installments in the fifth generation of the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon series of role-playing games. First released in Japan on September 18, 2010, they were later released in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011 and Australia on March 10, 2011.\n\nSimilar to previous installments of the series, the two games follow the journey of a young PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduce over 150 brand-new PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon to the franchise, as well as many new features, including a seasonal cycle, fully animated PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of each other, but feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dexes.\n\nUpon their release, Black and White received mostly positive reviews; critics praised the advancements in gameplay, as well as several of the new PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon introduced. Reviews, however, were divided on some of the character designs, and some critics felt that the games did not innovate as much as expected. Nevertheless, the games were commercial successes; prior to the games' Japanese release, Black and White sold one million consumer pre-orders and sold five million copies as of January 2011, making it one of the best selling DS games to date.\n\nGameplay\n++++++++\nPokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Black and White are role-playing video games with adventure elements, presented in a third-person, overhead perspective. There are three basic screens: an overworld, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with a single PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, and is able to capture more using PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Balls.\n\nWhen the player encounters a wild PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, or flee (however the player is not permitted to flee a battle against another trainer). All PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon have hit points (HP); when a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If an opposing PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon faints, then all of the player's PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon who participated in defeating it receive experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it may level up. A PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon's level affects its battle statistics, and some PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon will evolve upon reaching a certain level threshold.\n\nNew features\n++++++++++++\nThe graphics were further improved from previous games, and include more cutscenes. When talking to people, the dialog box has been changed to speech balloons, which appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. In addition to this aesthetic change, Japanese players will be given an option to switch to having kanji appear on screen, rather than just hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle.\n\nIn addition to the day and night cycle first introduced in the Gold and Silver games, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month, cycling every four, rather than being linked to the actual calendar. Outside areas appear differently depending on the season, such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon can be found in the wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. In addition to these features, the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Deerling and Sawsbuck were designed to change their physical appearance along with the seasons of the game.\n\nThere are two new battle mechanics in Black and White: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, both teams must send out three PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon at once. The PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon that can be targeted by any specific attack is dependent on the position of the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the line up; PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon on the left or right sides can only target the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon directly opposite of them and the two PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the center position on both sides, while PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the center can target all PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the field. Positions can be changed, but this uses up the player's turn. In Rotation Battles, both sides send out three PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon at once, again, but instead of a three-on-three match as seen in Triple Battles, it is a one-on-one match where the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon in the front can be switched with either of the two other PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon sent out without using up a turn. Depending on the game version, one of these two new battle types will be found in greater quantity than the other, with Black having more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and vice versa in White. Related introductions are the Combination Moves; the starter PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon from any game can be taught one of the three moves that can be used in combination with each other to produce more powerful attacks. Another battle mechanic is found in the wild, where differently colored and styled tall grass enable Double Battles against wild PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon.\n\nA new PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon capture mechanic was also introduced in these games, referred to as &quot;phenomena&quot; in supplementary materials. Occasionally, the player can find rustling patches of grass and rippling water. If the player enters the tile that featured the phenomenon (or uses the fishing rod on the tile), they can encounter either a rare PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon, a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon more common in the other game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon that can normally be found in the area. This method is the only way to capture PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. In addition to these, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon on certain bridges can also be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise.\n\nIn addition to the standard battling and Gym challenges, the player can compete in PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Musicals, a side-game similar to the PokÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova,[Note 1] a cruise ship that the player can ride daily and fight various trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHow To Install And Play The Game\n--------------------------------\nDouble-click the setup file.
