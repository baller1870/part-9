Somorjai (Wiley, 1994).pdf\n\nDescribes the present state of modern surface science, and is also a reference source for data and concepts related to properties of surfaces and interfaces. Focuses on the qualities of solid-gas and solid-vacuum interfaces. Discusses local attributes of surface atoms and molecules, atomic structures, chemical bonding, absorptions, catalysis and mechanical properties. Presents molecular understanding of surface phenomena and relates it to macroscopic surface properties","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf30a16be628fdfead4e2423e51084a2ef33d0d","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Surface+Chemistry+and+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf30a16be628fdfead4e2423e51084a2ef33d0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,243,10,22,190,98,143,223,234,212,226,66,62,81,8,74,46,243,61,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
