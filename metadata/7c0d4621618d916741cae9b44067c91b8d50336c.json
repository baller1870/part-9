This book warns Americans that a dreaded new world order is being built around them and that economic control is part of a plan to enslave us. John F. McManus analyzes many proposed solutions and quick fixes for America's financial woes and shows that most either just scratch the surface or do more harm than good.\n\nAbout the author:\nJohn F.
