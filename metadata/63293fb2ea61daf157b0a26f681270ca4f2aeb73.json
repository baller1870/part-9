The show follows him as he tries to perform incredibly well-thought-out and elaborate practical jokes, or pranks, on people. He lives in the fictional town of East Gackle. He constantly breaks the fourth wall when the screen freezes. Andy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His enemies include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech.

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCredits:\n\nCinÃƒÂ©Groupe, SIP Animation.\nCopyright CinÃƒÂ©GroupeÃ‚Â© 2001 - 2007.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63293fb2ea61daf157b0a26f681270ca4f2aeb73","amp;dn":"What%27s+With+Andy%3F+-+Season+2+%28English+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63293fb2ea61daf157b0a26f681270ca4f2aeb73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,41,63,178,234,97,218,241,87,176,162,111,104,18,112,202,79,42,235,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
