These unique, witty, and outrageous quotations, previously published in four separate volumes, are now gathered together in a seemingly limitless trove of pithy and often irreverent one-liners, retorts, put-downs, jokes, and last words that cover every conceivable subject and will appeal to every taste.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nRobert Byrne is the author of seven novels, five collections of humorous quotations, seven books on billiards, and an exposÃ© of frauds in the literary world. Byrne was born and raised in Dubuque, Iowa, where he has a regular humor column in the Dubuque Herald Times. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe 2,548 Best Things Anybody Ever Said\r\nSources, References, and Notes\r\nPrincipal Sources of Artwork\r\nIndex of Authors\r\nIndex of Subjects and Key Words\r\n \nhttp://s7.postimg.org/4hpr4pnm3/The_2_548_Best_Things_Anybody_Ever_Said.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b03976c35a7f8d5afcedfc12539c021b3922feb","amp;dn":"The+2%2C548+Best+Things+Anybody+Ever+Said+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b03976c35a7f8d5afcedfc12539c021b3922feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,3,151,108,53,167,248,213,175,206,223,193,37,57,192,33,179,146,47,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
