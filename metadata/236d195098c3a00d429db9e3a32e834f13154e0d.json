Conditions were tough, days were long. Victorian society began to grow suspicious of these 'outsiders' and they gained reputations for criminality, violence and drinking. But was this reputation really deserved? Liz discovers grisly canal crimes, investigates health and welfare onboard working boats, and looks at why canal children were last on the list to be offered safeguards and formal education. The Victorians eventually championed the needs of children who were forced to labour in factories and mines, but the boat children were often ignored. Liz discovers the campaigners who set out to tackle this injustice, including George Smith of Coalville, Leicestershire, and Sister Mary Ward of Stoke Bruerne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3073 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 657 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0689qmh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:236d195098c3a00d429db9e3a32e834f13154e0d","amp;dn":"Canals.The.Making.Of.A.Nation.5of6.The.The.Boat.People.720p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"236d195098c3a00d429db9e3a32e834f13154e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,109,25,80,152,195,160,13,66,157,185,227,163,46,131,79,19,21,78,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
