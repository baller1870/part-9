From sewing on buttons to putting in zippers, this guide walks kids step-by-step through various skill levels. They will learn to embroider, turn corners, and make curves with these fun designs. Multiple examples of each project encourage them to explore ideas. Featuring shapes, critters, and monsters that appeal to kidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ imagination, the projects build on skills and develop creativity.\nCreature Camp is a book that is written for children by Wendi and her daughter Jo. It's a book of sewing basics focusing on creating fun stuffed creatures, and it's suitable for new or experienced sewists ages 9 and up. It's kid-tested and approved, because all of the sewing was done by 11-year-old Jo and her friends.\n\nAbout the Author\nWendi Gratz spends her time designing sewing, quilting, and embroidery patterns especially for beginners. Her daughter, Jo, got her first sewing machine when she was four and has been sewing toys and clothes for herself and her dolls ever since. They reside in North Carolina.\n\nCONTENTS\nDedication/Acknowledgments 4\nAbout This Book 4\nChapter 1: Getting Started 5\nChapter 2: Basic Skills 12\nChapter 3: Straighten Up and Stuff It 18\nPROJECT: MR.
