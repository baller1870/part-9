It provides a consistent, in-depth treatment of technologies that are unlikely to receive detailed coverage in non-Web computer science courses. Students will find an ongoing case study that integrates a wide spectrum of Web technologies, guidance on setting up their own software environments, and a variety of exercises and project assignments.\n\n\n# Paperback: 574 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (August 27, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0131856030\n# ISBN-13: 978-0131856035","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:356f2979b47ade54bcfacefde128dbcbceae78e4","amp;dn":"Web+Technologies-A+Computer+Science+Perspective%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"356f2979b47ade54bcfacefde128dbcbceae78e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,111,41,121,180,122,222,84,188,250,206,253,225,40,219,203,206,174,120,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
