This book shows you how to use AtmelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s $19.99 AVR Butterfly board and the FREE WinAVR C compiler to make a very inexpensive system for using C to develop microcontroller projects.\n\nStudents will find the thorough coverage of C explained in the context of microcontrollers to be an invaluable learning aide. Professionals, even those who already know C, will find many useful tested software and hardware examples that will speed their development work.\n\nIn addition to an in-depth coverage of C, the book has projects for:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Port I/O reading switches and blinking LEDs\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ UART communication with a PC\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Using interrupts, timers, and counters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pulse Width Modulation for LED brightness and motor speed control\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Creating a Real Time Clock\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Making music\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ADC: Analog to Digital Conversion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ DAC: Digital to Analog Conversion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Voltage, light, and temperature measurement\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Making a slow Function Generator and Digital Oscilloscope\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ LCD programming\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Writing a Finite State Machine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca335ca8799c3b4814cbcc7c21e1c9572ed3c4d","amp;dn":"C+Programming+for+Microcontrollers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca335ca8799c3b4814cbcc7c21e1c9572ed3c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,163,53,202,135,153,195,180,129,76,188,199,194,30,28,149,114,237,60,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
