Developed by WB Games MontrÃŽËœal, the game \n  features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel \n  storyline set several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and \n  Batman: Arkham City, the first two critically acclaimed games of the \n  franchise. Taking place before the rise of Gotham CityÃƒâ€ s most dangerous \n  criminals, the game showcases a young and unrefined Batman as he faces a \n  defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path \n  to becoming the Dark Knight.\n\n  Features:\n\n  * The Arkham Story Begins: Batman: Arkham Origins features a pivotal tale \n  set on Christmas Eve where Batman is hunted by eight of the deadliest \n  assassins from the DC Comics Universe. Players become an early-career \n  Batman as he encounters for the first time many of the characters that \n  shape his future. \n\n  * Enhanced Detective Mode: Think like Batman with an all-new Case File \n  system that allows players to analyze seemingly impossible-to-solve crime \n  reconstructions in real time.

Glide above or \n  battle your way through new and ever more dangerous districts in the quest \n  for justice. Prevent crimes in progress, take down gangs of violent new \n  criminals and explore deadly new locations, from the impoverished streets \n  to the penthouses of Gotham's wealthy. \n\n  * Gotham's Most Wanted: The city streets are filled with more than just \n  Black Mask's assassins. Locate and take down Gotham's most violent and \n  dangerous criminals to earn unique upgrades. \n\n  * Lethal New Enemies: Fight new foes such as the Armored Enforcer, the \n  Martial Artist and more ÃƒÂ» each of which challenge players to approach \n  Batman's FreeFlow Combat scenarios in different ways. Classic FreeFlow \n  combat is expanded with every new opponent ÃƒÂ» and with Batman's abilities \n  to engage them. \n\n  * New Gadgets: Utilize Batman's signature gadgets or take advantage of \n  powerful new additions such as the Remote Claw, the Concussion Detonator \n  and more.

Ready the Concussion Detonator to stun and disorient groups of \n  opponents in close combat. \n\n  * New and Familiar Characters: Experience a fresh take on iconic Batman \n  characters including Black Mask, Penguin, Deathstroke, Bane, Deadshot, \n  Anarky, Captain Gordon, The Joker, Copperhead, Firefly and others yet to \n  be revealed. \n\n  * New Online Mode: Play online with friends and foes in 3v3v2 gameplay \n  that blends traditional Arkham gameplay with third-person shooter \n  mechanics.
