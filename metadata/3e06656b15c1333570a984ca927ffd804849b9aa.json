Roberts\n\nProduct Description\nThis college textbook is unique in that it was underwritten by an Education Foundation supported by practitioners of the Asphalt Industry. The text was compiled &amp; written by the staff of the National Center for Asphalt Technology (NCAT), located on the campus of Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama. The textbook was written to serve as a primary reference for Civil Engineering &amp; Construction Management courses having to do with pavement materials, pavement design, &amp; pavement management. It is also an excellent supplemental text for Engineering courses on construction materials. The textbook serves as the foundation for the Professor Training Program run by NCAT. The 9 chapters cover the life cycle of asphalt cement from the refinery to the production of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements. Included is a chapter on aggregates, Mix designs, production &amp; placement equipment, testing, specifications, quality assurance &amp; recycling. Latter chapters discuss how pavement performance is measured &amp; contains an overview of maintenance &amp; rehabilitation practices.
