Laugh if you must at this cast of characters, but at this ripe intersection in my life, their combination became my personal recipe for disaster...&quot; So begins Van Horn's amazing graphic novella, a collection of short stories and vignettes, mostly autobiographical, part mystical exploration, depicting incidents from the author's life, as well as those of her friends, neighbors and relatives. The title story is an intense autobiographical account of her nervous breakdown which is alternately riotous and terrifying. Van Horn uses her trademark painstaking scratchboard style (as seen in Weirdo and Twisted Sisters) for every page, giving the book a shockingly intense visual look.\n\nShould you ever feel like buying one of Fantagraphics super awesome books (and almost all of them are, imo), please visit their website http://www.fantagraphics.com/ (the 20/20 Club is a great deal), or ask your LCS guy to point you in the right direction (or get on the ball and order some stuff!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7165a376c7ca0f280d3d5eb7278c9f549e7b738","amp;dn":"Recipe+for+Disaster+and+Other+Stories+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7165a376c7ca0f280d3d5eb7278c9f549e7b738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,22,90,55,108,124,160,242,128,211,213,235,114,120,201,245,73,231,183,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
