The rhythmic drive and overall flavor of the group are still essentially the same, though, and Horace-Scope continues the tight, sophisticated-yet-swinging blueprint for hard bop pioneered on its two classic predecessors. The program is as appealing as ever, and even though not as many tunes caught on this time -- at least not on the level of a &quot;Juicy Lucy&quot; or &quot;Sister Sadie&quot; -- Silver's writing is tuneful and tasteful. The best-known selections are probably the lovely closing number &quot;Nica's Dream,&quot; which had been around for several years but hadn't yet been recorded on a Silver LP, and the genial, laid-back opener &quot;Strollin'.&quot; But really, every selection is full of soulful grooves and well-honed group interplay, the qualities that made this band perhaps the top hard bop outfit of the early '60s. Silver was in the midst of a hot streak that wouldn't let up for another few years, and Horace-Scope is another eminently satisfying effort from that period. \n\nHorace Silver - Piano\nBlue Mitchell - Trumpet\nJunior Cook - Tenor\nGene Taylor - Bass\nRoy Brooks - Drums\n\n01.
