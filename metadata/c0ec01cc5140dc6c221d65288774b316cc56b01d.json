Specifically, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand evilÃ¢â‚¬â€what it is, how it works, and why it so routinely and effortlessly ruins our lives.\n\nIn How Evil Works , veteran newsman and bestselling author David Kupelian takes a fresh and insightful look at this ancient subject. Diving into the most electrifying news stories of the dayÃ¢â‚¬â€from terrorism and school violence to high-profile sex scandals and dysfunctional Hollywood celebritiesÃ¢â‚¬â€Kupelian explores the secret world of seduction, corruption, and daily temptations in everyday life, demonstrating his uncanny knack for breaking down complex, elusive, and intimidating topics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ec01cc5140dc6c221d65288774b316cc56b01d","amp;dn":"How+Evil+Works%3A+Understanding+and+Overcoming+the+Destructive+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ec01cc5140dc6c221d65288774b316cc56b01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,236,1,204,81,64,220,108,34,29,101,40,135,116,179,22,204,86,176,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
