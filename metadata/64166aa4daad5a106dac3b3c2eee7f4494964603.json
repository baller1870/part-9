Two years ago, at Leafmore High, a group of young teenagers were trapped inside their school and hunted by monsters that had been released by the maniac headmaster. Some of them survived that terrible night, while others perished. Now, the survivors have picked up their lives and joined college. But all is not right on Fallcreek University; strange black flowers have suddenly sprung up everywhere on the campus. While experimenting with these flowers in class, a dangerous substance is discovered that induces strange but vivid dreams. But a handful of students find out that there is more to the flowers than anyone could have expected; when the seeds finally germinate, a bad trip suddenly turns into a horrible reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64166aa4daad5a106dac3b3c2eee7f4494964603","amp;dn":"Obscure+2+%5BEnglish%5D%5BPCDVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64166aa4daad5a106dac3b3c2eee7f4494964603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,22,106,164,218,173,90,16,109,172,59,60,46,238,127,68,148,150,70,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
