Kaczynski does not receive remuneration for this book.\n\n&quot;Like many of my colleagues, I felt that I could easily have been the Unabomber's next target. He is clearly a Luddite, but simply saying that does not dismiss his argument...As difficult as it is for me to acknowledge, I saw some merit in the reasons in [Kaczynski's writing].&quot; --Bill Joy, founder of Sun Microsystems in &quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,&quot; Wired magazine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5222c2dd571eaefe1d9e6f81b6f6170773b87674","amp;dn":"Technological+Slavery+by+Kaczynski+Unabomber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5222c2dd571eaefe1d9e6f81b6f6170773b87674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,34,194,221,87,30,174,254,29,158,111,129,182,246,23,7,115,184,118,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
