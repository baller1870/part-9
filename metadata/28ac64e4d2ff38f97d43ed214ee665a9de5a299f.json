If you happen to be in London on October 25-28, you can see their copy of Beowulf on display.\n\nFor those of us who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it to London, listening to the audiobook version of the Seamus Heaney translation is another great way to celebrate this epic poem. The translation by the Nobel Prize-winning author was named a Best Book of the Year by the New York Times and Library Journal. AudioFile Magazine awarded our audio recording, narrated by Golden Voice George Guidall, an AudioFile Earphones Award.\n\nPairing the printÃ¢â‚¬â€especially the Heaney translation, which in most cases has a side-by side view of the modern translation and the Old EnglishÃ¢â‚¬â€with the audio will allow students to comprehend the famous work and hear the poetic elements without having to struggle through archaic text and notoriously difficult Old English names. Our Heaney translation also includes a wealth of information before and after the poem itself, including background information, author information, literary criticism, and a discussion of the art of translation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ac64e4d2ff38f97d43ed214ee665a9de5a299f","amp;dn":"Beowulf+-+New+Verse+Translation+-+Seamus+Heaney%2C+Nar+by+George+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28ac64e4d2ff38f97d43ed214ee665a9de5a299f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,172,100,228,210,255,56,249,125,67,237,33,78,230,101,169,222,90,41,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
