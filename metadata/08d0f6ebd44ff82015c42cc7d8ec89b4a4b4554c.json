With limits you can easily manage your internet connection?s bandwidth (bandwidth shaper) and share it among all applications running on your computer.\n\nGrants\nGrant is a brand-new feature in NetLimiter 2. It could seem similar to limits, but it works differently. When you set grant for application or connection, then it means that you grant specified bandwidth for it. If other application/connections take too much bandwidth, then it is taken from them and is given to application/connection with granted bandwidth.\n\nNetwork monitor\nNetLimiter 2 shows list of all applications communicating over network it&amp;#039;s connections and transfer rates.\n\nPersonal firewall functionality\nYou can allow or deny certain applications to connect to or from any network or zone (see below).\nZones\n\nNetLimiter 2 monitors and controls traffic separately on three predefined zones - My Computer, Local Network and Internet. For example, you can limit the traffic rate of your browser downloading from the Internet and let it download from intranet at full speed. Later we will add tool for defining you cutom zones.\nFilters\n\nWith filters you can define groups of connections or applications and then apply rules to them. You can for example set DL/UL limit only for a specific IP address range or for a group of two or more applications.\nRule editor and scheduler\n\nRule editor helps you to create advanced rules. For example, you can create limit or firewall rule for a group of applications which is valid only in a given time interval (=you can schedule limits, grants and fw rules).\nNetwork manager\n\nUsing Network manager you can assign networks present on you computer to NetLimiter zones. It&amp;#039;s also possible to add your own networks.\n\nStatistics\nSimilarly to NetLimiter 1.x stats, NetLimiter 2 stats module is intended for long-term measurement of internet traffic. This feature lets you to track your internet traffic history since you&amp;#039;ve installed NetLimiter 2. NetLimiter 2 is able to automatically export statistical data to disk.\n \nTraffic chart\nThis feature is known from previous version of NetLimiter. Traffic chart shows application&amp;#039;s or connection&amp;#039;s real time activity.\n\nRemote administration\nYou can control and monitor other computers remotely from one place.\n\nInfos\nSimilarly to NetLimiter 1.x version, NetLimiter 2 provides you with and additional information like WHOIS, traceroute etc.\n\nLogs\nThis feature will be included soon.
