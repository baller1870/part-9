AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s History provides a clear explanation. Instructors rely on AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s History to help them teach that history matters Ã¢â‚¬â€ this means helping their students understand not only what happened, but also why.

The hallmark of the revision is a thorough reconsideration of the post-1945 period that incorporates new scholarship and makes sense of the recent past, but AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s History, Sixth Edition offers much more. This includes additional narrative changes in both volumes, a new in-text feature program based on written and visual primary documents in every chapter, and a host of new and improved pedagogic features. With its clear exposition, insightful analysis and in-text sources, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s History, gives instructors and students everything they need.
