Baywatch Nights is a spin-off show from the popular syndicated series Baywatch. The series stars David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, who operates a private detective agency. After the first year, the series took on a different focus for the episode plots with many of them focusing on the occult and similar themes.\nThe original premise of the show was that, during a midlife crisis, Sgt. Garner Ellerbee, who was the resident police officer of Baywatch since the beginning of the series, decides to quit his job as a police officer and form a detective agency. Mitch Buchannon, his friend from Baywatch, joins to support him and they are in turn joined by a detective named Ryan McBride. Singer Lou Rawls, who starred in the first season, performed the series theme song, &quot;After the Sun Goes Down&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dfa594b40d247ad8a231263f9f5b7fc32a4b2b2","amp;dn":"Baywatch+Nights+-+1+season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dfa594b40d247ad8a231263f9f5b7fc32a4b2b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,250,89,75,64,210,71,173,138,35,18,99,249,245,183,252,50,164,178,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
