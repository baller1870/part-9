When an executive &quot;motivator&quot; (Alec Baldwin) demands a sales contest among the agents in the cramped office, the stakes are critically high: any agent who fails to meet his quota will lose his job. This intense ultimatum is a boon for the office superstar (Al Pacino), but a once-successful salesman (Jack Lemmon) now finds himself clinging nervously to faded glory. Political and personal rivalries erupt under pressure when the other agents (Alan Arkin, Ed Harris) suspect the office manager (Kevin Spacey) of foul play.\n\n  Starring: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey.\n\n  Directed by: James Foley.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 40min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x  336\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9874250938875c7b12bb7c22cba41a327892a369","amp;dn":"Glengarry+Glen+Ross+%281992%29+%28Al+Pacino%2C+Jack+Lemmon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9874250938875c7b12bb7c22cba41a327892a369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,116,37,9,56,135,92,123,18,187,124,34,203,164,26,50,120,146,163,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
