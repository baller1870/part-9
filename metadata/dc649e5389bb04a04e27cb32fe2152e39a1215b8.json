I have a personal friend who worked on this project, and the movies are hard to find on the internet and rarely get rerun, so I want to make sure people can see these engaging documentaries.\n\n\n\nFrom ESPN's 30 for 30 official site for Muhammad and Larry:\n\nIn October of 1980 Muhammad Ali was preparing to fight for an unprecedented fourth heavyweight title against his friend and former sparring partner Larry Holmes. To say that the great Ali was in the twilight of his career would be generous; most of his admiring fans, friends and fight scribes considered his bravado delusional. What was left for him to prove? In the weeks of training before the fight, documentarians Albert and David Maysles took an intimate look at Ali trying to convince the world and perhaps himself, that he was still ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Greatest.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At the same time, they documented the mild-mannered and undervalued champion Holmes as he confidently prepared to put an end to the career of a man for whom he had an abiding and deep affection. In the raw moments after AliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s humbling in this one-sided fight, it was not fully comprehended what the Maysles brothers had actually captured on film and, due to unexpected circumstances, the Maysles footage never received a public screening or airing. However, in the intervening years, the magnitude of this footage is now clear. An era ended when the braggadocio and confidence were stripped away in the ring, and the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest hero was revealed to be a man. Here for the first time is the unseen filmed build up to that fight, accompanied by freshly shot interviews by Albert Maysles with members from both the Ali and Holmes camps, as well as others who were prime witnesses to this poignant foolhardy attempt at courage.\n\n\n\nAbout 30 for 30:\n\n[30 for 30] is an unprecedented documentary series featuring thirty films from some of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest storytellers. Each filmmaker will bring their passion and personal point of view to their film detailing the issues, trends, athletes, teams, rivalries, games and events that transformed the sports landscape from 1979 to 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc649e5389bb04a04e27cb32fe2152e39a1215b8","amp;dn":"ESPN+-+30+for+30%3A+Muhammad+and+Larry+%28HD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc649e5389bb04a04e27cb32fe2152e39a1215b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,100,158,83,137,187,4,160,78,39,203,50,254,33,82,227,154,18,21,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
