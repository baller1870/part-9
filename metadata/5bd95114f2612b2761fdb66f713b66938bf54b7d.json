Plants. \nThe nature documentary series examines plants and their ingenious and manipulative solutions to life's challenges. Time-lapse photography reveals plants acting like fly-paper, or spring-loaded traps, to catch insects. Vines develop suckers and claws to haul themselves up trees. Every peculiar shape proves to have a clever purpose; the dragon's blood tree's upturned umbrella form captures mist, and the seed of a Bornean tree has wings so aerodynamic they inspired the design of early gliders.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 1.80GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bd95114f2612b2761fdb66f713b66938bf54b7d","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+09of10+Plants+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bd95114f2612b2761fdb66f713b66938bf54b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,217,81,20,242,97,43,39,97,253,182,111,113,59,102,147,139,245,75,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
