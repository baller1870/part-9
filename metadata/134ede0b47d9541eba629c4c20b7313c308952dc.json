And although the relationship between children and parents is central to healthy development, a variety of community members and institutions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ schools, programs, neighborhoods ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often make important and lasting contributions. \n Promoting Positive Development in Early Childhood introduces Developmental Assets for Early Childhood, a unique strengths-based framework that identifies the spectrum of positive influences on child development inside and outside the home and the qualities that can be nurtured with their concerted help. Translating insight, evidence, and research into meaningful practice, this volume: \n Defines core areas of healthy development in terms of internal assets (e.g., positive identity and social competence) and external ones (e.g., empowerment and support), and includes both widely acknowledged and emerging concepts. \n Presents a holistic approach to development by addressing the multiple influences and structures shaping childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives. \n Emphasizes resilience as a key component in healthy development and prevention against future risk. \n Offers parents and community members practical guidelines informed by current theory and intervention design. \n Establishes continuity of development from early and middle childhood through adolescence. \n Promoting Positive Development in Early Childhood is essential reading for clinicians, researchers, and other professionals whose work focuses on helping young children grow and thrive, including developmental, clinical, and community psychologists, educators, social workers, and policy makers and agencies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:134ede0b47d9541eba629c4c20b7313c308952dc","amp;dn":"Promoting+Positive+Development+in+Early+Childhood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"134ede0b47d9541eba629c4c20b7313c308952dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,78,222,11,71,217,84,30,186,98,156,76,32,183,49,60,48,137,82,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
