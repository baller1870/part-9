Vladimir Putin, with very little governmental or administrative experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, and briefly, director of the secret policeÃ¢â‚¬â€nevertheless seemed the perfect choice: a Ã¢â‚¬Å“facelessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ creature whom Yeltsin and his cronies could mold in their own image. Russia and an infatuated West were determined to see in him the progressive leader of their dreamsÃ¢â‚¬â€even as Putin, with ruthless efficiency, dismantled the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s media, wrested control and wealth from the business class, and destroyed the fragile mechanisms of democracy. Within a few brief years, virtually every obstacle to his unbridled control was removed and every opposing voice silenced, with political rivals and critics driven into exile or to the grave.\n      \n Masha Gessen has experienced and reported this history firsthand, and brings it up to its present moment of unrest and uncertainty. Her spellbinding account of PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise and reign will stand as a classic of narrative nonfiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06434f0eb100b07bd0e4252f6260414f41d2feea","amp;dn":"The+Man+Without+a+Face%3A+The+Unlikely+Rise+of+Vladimir+Putin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06434f0eb100b07bd0e4252f6260414f41d2feea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,67,79,14,177,0,176,123,208,228,37,47,98,96,65,79,65,210,254,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
