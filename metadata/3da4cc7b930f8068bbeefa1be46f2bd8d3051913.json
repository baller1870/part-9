James Cagney stars as Biff Grimes, a turn-of-the-century dentist married to onetime suffragette Amy Lind (Olivia de Havilland). A former convict, Biff has great difficulty keeping his temper--and when alderman Hugo Barnstead (Jack Carson), the man responsible for Cagney's unjust prison term, shows up one Sunday afternoon to have a tooth pulled, the pugnacious dentist begins developing homicidal urges. In a lengthy flashback, we learn that Biff and Hugo, once the best of friends, were business partners in a construction firm. When one of their buildings collapsed due to shoddy materials, Biff was sent to jail for five years, while Hugo escaped scot-free. Even worse, Hugo stole Biff's girlfriend Virginia Brush (Rita Hayworth), the &quot;strawberry blonde&quot; of the title. The flashback over, Biff sharkishly welcomes Hugo into his office, fully intending to bump off his old enemy. But during a reunion with his &quot;dream girl&quot; Virginia, Biff realizes for the first time that Amy was the right girl for him all along, and that Hugo did him a favor by taking the strident, shrewish Virginia off his hands. Letting Hugo off with little more than a sore jaw, Biff takes Amy in his arms--but not before settling a few old accounts with his fists, just for old time's sake.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector: Raoul Walsh\n\n\n\n\n        James Cagney\t ... \tBiff Grimes\n\n\tOlivia de Havilland\t... \tAmy Lind\n\n\tRita Hayworth\t... \tVirginia Brush\n\tAlan Hale\t... \tOld Man Grimes\n\n\tJack Carson\t... \tHugo Barnstead\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:38:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1313 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 103 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3da4cc7b930f8068bbeefa1be46f2bd8d3051913","amp;dn":"The+strawberry+blonde+%281941%29+James+Cagney+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3da4cc7b930f8068bbeefa1be46f2bd8d3051913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,164,204,123,147,15,128,104,187,238,250,27,228,111,43,216,211,5,25,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
