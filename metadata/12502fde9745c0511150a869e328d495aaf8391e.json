Learn about what physical quantities you can measure and what types of sensors you can buy or build. We cover the 5 essential design limits as well: power, bandwidth, resolution, computing... and legal limitations. Explore what you can play with using your own personal satellite.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img801/8836/qg7t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img801/8836/qg7t.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nDr. Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Antunes (born 1967 in Baltimore, Maryland) is a Maryland-area astronomer, author, and role playing game designer.
