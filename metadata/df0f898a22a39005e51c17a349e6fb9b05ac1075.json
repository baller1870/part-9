Surprisingly, none of the album's eight songs are originals, relying instead on traditional tunes like &quot;900 Miles&quot; and &quot;Cotton Eyed Joe&quot;; while Callier's spiralling acoustic guitar lines and the use of two bassists (Terbour Attenborough and John Tweedle) reflect his admiration of John Coltrane, New Folk Sound is for the most part stark and simple, possessed of a subtle grace which spotlights his remarkably moving vocals to excellent effect -- it's a debut which holds all the promise fulfilled by his classic recordings for Cadet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df0f898a22a39005e51c17a349e6fb9b05ac1075","amp;dn":"Terry+Callier+-+The+New+Folk+Sound+Of+Terry+Callier+%5B1968%5D%5BEAC%2Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df0f898a22a39005e51c17a349e6fb9b05ac1075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,15,137,138,34,163,144,5,229,28,23,163,73,230,251,155,5,172,16,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
