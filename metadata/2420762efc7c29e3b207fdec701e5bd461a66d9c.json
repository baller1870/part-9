Still lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€like the medium of watercolorÃ¢â‚¬â€was traditionally considered to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“lowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the hierarchy of French academic paintings. Cezanne chose to ignore this hierarchy, creating monumental still-life watercolors that contained echoes of grand landscapes and even historical paintings in the manner of PoussinÃ¢â‚¬â€the Ã¢â‚¬Å“highestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of classical art forms. In so doing he charged his still lifes with new meanings, both in terms of his own notoriously difficult personality and in the way he used the genre to explore the very process of looking at, and creating, art.\n\nCarol ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study is a fascinating exploration of the brilliant watercolor paintings that brought CezanneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career to a complex, and triumphant, conclusion. The book includes new photographic studies of the GettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painting that allow the reader to encounter this great watercolor as never before, in all of its richness and detail","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2420762efc7c29e3b207fdec701e5bd461a66d9c","amp;dn":"Cezanne+in+the+Studio+-+Still+Life+in+Watercolors+%28Art+Ebook%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2420762efc7c29e3b207fdec701e5bd461a66d9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,32,118,46,252,124,41,227,178,7,253,236,112,30,91,212,97,166,109,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
