Originally, the heroine was a widowed mother who kept the wolf from the door by setting up a successful pancake business with her black housemaid. In the remake, Lana Turner stars as a would-be actress who is raising her daughter on her own. She chances to meet another single mother at the beach: African-American Juanita Moore. Moore  goes to work as Turner's housekeeper, bringing her light-skinned daughter along. As Turner's stage career goes into high gear, Moore  is saddled with the responsibility of raising both Turner's daughter and her own. Exposed to the advantages of the white world, Moore's grown-up daughter (Susan Kohner) passes for white, causing her mother a great deal of heartache. Meanwhile, Turner's grown daughter (Sandra Dee), neglected by her mother, seeks comfort in the arms of handsome photographer John Gavin. When Moore  dies, her daughter realizes how selfish she's been; simultaneously, Turner  awakens to the fact that she hasn't been much of a mother for her own daughter, whose romance has gone down the tubes. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Imitation Of Life.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 645 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1 520 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.864\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.263\n      Stream size : 1.27 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 112 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 112 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 95.7 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 510 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.93 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.4 --vbr-old -b 112\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052918/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052918/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nFrom KG, by unclemeat\n\nDouglas Sirk - Imitation Of Life (1959)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e6c9e3148cdd76d6d3ace158b10b6fb334ac851","amp;dn":"Douglas+Sirk+-+Imitation+Of+Life+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e6c9e3148cdd76d6d3ace158b10b6fb334ac851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,108,158,49,72,205,215,109,109,58,206,21,139,16,182,251,51,74,200,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
