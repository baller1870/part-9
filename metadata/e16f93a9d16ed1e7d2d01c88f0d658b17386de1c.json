Originally, some of the Hitsville studio musicians would be ''allowed'' to cut soulful Blues and Jazz tracks for the company's Workshop Jazz label, as long as they handled the regular gig, cutting hits on the Hitsville U.S.A. assembly line. By 1964, however, Workshop Jazz was dead. Motown made good on their promise, somewhat, giving Earl Van Dyke a rare opportunity in the spotlight by issuing in his name a single and a subsequent LP, That Motown Sound. Earl's artistic disappointment belies the gems contained within those vocal-less Motown hits and the additional bonus tracks from Motown's vaults that comprise Disc One of this set. Additional previously unheard nuggets can be found amongst the bonus tracks on Disc Two.\r\n\r\nSure, now The Funk Brothers, Motown Recordsâ€™ legendary in-house band, are notable names to pop and soul aficionados, thanks in large part to 2002â€™s Standing in the Shadows of Motown documentary and its Grammy-winning soundtrack. But for nearly the entire golden age of the Detroit label, the group was kept away from the spotlight. Hip-o Selectâ€™s newest title collects, for the first time on CD, the sole exception to that rule.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, Motown quietly released That Motown Sound, an album credited to Earl Van Dyke and The Soul Brothers. Itâ€™s not hard to guess who makes up the group (though label founder Berry Gordy insisted on the name change from â€œfunkâ€ to â€œsoulâ€), and the familiar hit songs played on the album, including â€œCome See About Me,â€ â€œMy Girlâ€ and â€œMoney (Thatâ€™s What I Want)â€ are in fact the original backing tracks with new keyboard overdubs by Van Dyke, the bandâ€™s main keyboardist.\r\n\r\nVan Dyke and the band were recording more sides even while laying down some of the most notable grooves in pop history. Some, including â€œSoul Stompâ€ and â€œThe Flick,â€ were released as singles on Motownâ€™s Soul imprint; many were left in the fabled vaults. A 1970 live album, The Earl of Funk, saw the band run through live covers of Motown hits as well as tracks by Ben E. King, Jimmy Webb, The Meters and Sly and The Family Stone.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01 - Nowhere To Run\r\n02 - Come See About Me\r\n03 - You're A Wonderful One\r\n04 - How Sweet It Is\r\n05 - My Girl\r\n06 - All For You\r\n07 - Too Many Fish In The Sea\r\n08 - Try It Baby\r\n09 - The Way You Do The Things You Do\r\n10 - Can I Get A Witness\r\n11 - Can You Jerk Like Me\r\n12 - Money\r\n13 - I Can't Help Myself\r\n14 - Soul Stomp\r\n15 - Hot 'N' Tot\r\n16 - Mobile Lil The Dancing Witch\r\n17 - He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'\r\n18 - All Day All Night\r\n19 - Opus And Funk\r\n20 - Too Many Fish In The Sea\r\n21 - Soul Stomp\r\n22 - 6 By 6\r\n23 - There Is No Greater Love\r\n24 - The Flick\r\n25 - You Name It\r\n\r\nCD2\r\n01 - Someday We'll Be Together\r\n02 - Rainy Night In Georgia\r\n03 - Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin\r\n04 - Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\r\n05 - Wichita Lineman\r\n06 - The Flick\r\n07 - Cissy Strut\r\n08 - Stand By Me\r\n09 - My Cherie Amour\r\n10 - Fuschia Moods\r\n11 - The Stingray\r\n12 - The Whip-A-Rang\r\n13 - Runaway Child Running Wild\r\n14 - Gonna Give Her All The Love I've Got\r\n15 - Fever In The Funk House\r\n16 - Behold\r\n17 - Greedy Green\r\n18 - Up On Your Feet\r\n19 - Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\r\n20 - Ode To Benny B\r\n\r\n*2012 Motown / Hip-O Select / Universal | B0016212-02\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nKeyboards, Leader, Organ: Earl van Dyke\r\nGroup The Funk Brothers\r\nSaxophone: Eli Fontaine\r\nTambourine, Vibes: Jack Ashford\r\nGuitar: Robert White\r\nBass: Tony Newton\r\nDrums: Bob Cousar\r\nBass: James Jamerson, Jr.\r\nDrums: Uriel Jones\r\nCongas, Percussion: Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown\r\nSaxophone: George Benson\r\nDrums: Benny Benjamin\r\nHarmonica: Stevie Wonder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e16f93a9d16ed1e7d2d01c88f0d658b17386de1c","amp;dn":"Earl+Van+Dyke+-+The+Motown+Sound%3A+The+Complete+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e16f93a9d16ed1e7d2d01c88f0d658b17386de1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,111,147,169,209,110,209,231,210,208,28,136,240,214,88,177,115,134,222,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
