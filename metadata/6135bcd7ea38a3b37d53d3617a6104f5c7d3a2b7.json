[the] folk song collecting trip to the Southern states lasted from July to November 1959 and resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, Wade Ward, Charlie Higgins and Bessie Jones and culminated in the discovery of Mississippi Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued under the title Sounds of the South and some were also featured in the Coen brothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ film 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou.' - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax\n\n\nAlan Lomax received funding from Atlantic Records in 1959 to head into the Southeast with the latest in stereo field recording technology, and this set collects the original eight records issued as a result of that trek in 1961. The sound quality is brilliant, the performances uncompromisingly raw, vibrant, plaintive, and real--everything the Greenwich Village folk movement tried to be is encapsulated on these slices of rural sound. Because of its high fidelity and the immense character found within the performances, this is the Lomax document to own if you absolutely have to pick a single one. Deep delta slide blues, enthusiastic shape-note singing from the Sacred Harp song book, lined-out hymnody, children's songs, mountain bluegrass music, juke-joint barrelhouse blues--it's all here and much more. This is vibrant, pure American music at its finest.&quot;  - http://www.amazon.com/Sounds-South-Various-Artists/dp/B000002IVR\n\n\nDisc: 1\n1. Banks of the Arkansas/Wave the Ocean - Neil Morris\n2.
