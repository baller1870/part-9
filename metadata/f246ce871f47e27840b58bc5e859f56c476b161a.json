Once a single man trying his hand at farming and experimenting with making artisanal produce, MatthewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now a fully fledged family man with partner, Sadie, and son, Hedley. Time to get serious about bringing home the bacon.\n\nMatthew sets about upscaling his farm, which goes from being home for 2 pigs to 22 and coming up with ways of preserving and selling the extra pork produce from more than just his market stall. An invitation to Slow FoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Salon in Turin affords him the opportunity to go to Italy and France and learn artisanal ways of preserving meat which might help even out his Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdrought or glutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ issues.\n\nWith his mates Nick and Ross, a new business idea is born Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A Common Ground. The aim is to go to remote locations around Tasmania, set up a long table, and cook multiple course menus from produce sourced solely from the area. Will locals and mainlanders travel the miles and pay the price for a genuine locavore experience?\n\nBut itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all hard work. Matthew continues his boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own adventures with a Kayak trip down the Picton River with his mates Nick and Ross.\nLanguage: English\n\nDecided to separate the discs on this one\nThis download contains the last 4 episodes and 11 extras (recipes) on Disc 2\nLook for Disc 2 for the rest with extras.\n\nvideo H264 mp4\n1280x 720\nfps 25\nkb 2400\naudio ac3 160\n\nThanks to Yify torrents for my compression..very grateful\n\nenjoy cheers Gezza","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f246ce871f47e27840b58bc5e859f56c476b161a","amp;dn":"Gourmet+Farmer+season+2+Disc+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f246ce871f47e27840b58bc5e859f56c476b161a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,70,206,135,31,71,226,120,64,181,139,197,232,89,245,108,71,107,22,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
