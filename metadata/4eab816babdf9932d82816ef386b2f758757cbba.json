This text covers developmental anatomy, the thorax, the central nervous system, and the head and neck with an emphasis on the practical application of anatomical knowledge. \n\nThis new edition has been extensively revised and updated in line with contemporary teaching and dental practice. Over 300 new full colour diagrams map all the anatomical regions that dental students need to know, while the lively and accessible text guides the reader's learning.
