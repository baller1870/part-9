You can start playing three minutes after starting to read it, it's so easy to learn. Instead of dice or cards, its system of mechanics uses money and fine wines. And you don't need a GM.\n\nThe players all play eighteenth-century noblemen, and challenge each other to tell stories of their amazing adventures. For example, if it was my go, I might turn to you and say, &quot;My dear Baron, do tell us the story of how you defeated the entire Turkish army with only the aid of two rabbits and a piece of cheese.&quot;\n\nThe Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen is designed to be a pick-up-and-play RPG. It's fast to play, cheap to buy and a great way of introducing new players to the idea of RPGs. It's been praised by games-industry figures such as Allen Varney, Phil Masters and Steffan O'Sullivan, and was nominated for the 1998 Origins Award in the &quot;Best RPG&quot; category.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hogshead.demon.co.uk/newstyle/ns_baronm.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hogshead.demon.co.uk/newstyle/ns_baronm.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0da054cd6180e372034fed4ec45a5ef7f2cd8b0","amp;dn":"The+Extraordinary+Adventures+of+Baron+Munchausen.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0da054cd6180e372034fed4ec45a5ef7f2cd8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,218,5,76,214,24,14,55,32,52,254,212,236,69,165,239,127,44,216,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
