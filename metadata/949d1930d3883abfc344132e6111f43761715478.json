The contents are devoted to the application of fractional calculus to physical problems. The fractional concept is applied to subjects in classical mechanics, group theory, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, hadron spectroscopy and quantum field theory and it will surprise the reader with new intriguing insights. This new, extended edition now also covers additional chapters about image processing, folded potentials in cluster physics, infrared spectroscopy and local aspects of fractional calculus. A new feature is exercises with elaborated solutions, which significantly supports a deeper understanding of general aspects of the theory. As a result, this book should also be useful as a supporting medium for teachers and courses devoted to this subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949d1930d3883abfc344132e6111f43761715478","amp;dn":"Fractional+Calculus%2C+An+Introduction+for+Phyicists%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949d1930d3883abfc344132e6111f43761715478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,157,25,48,211,136,58,191,195,68,19,46,97,17,244,55,97,113,84,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
