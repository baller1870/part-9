As dusk deepens to night, he begins the tale that has brought them to this fateful meeting . . .\n\nChangez is living an immigrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of America. At the top of his class at Princeton, he is snapped up by the elite &quot;valuation&quot; firm of Underwood Samson. He thrives on the energy of New York, and his infatuation with elegant, beautiful Erica promises entry into Manhattan society at the same exalted level once occupied by his own family back in Lahore.\n\nBut in the wake of September 11, Changez finds his position in his adopted city suddenly overturned, and his budding relationship with Erica eclipsed by the reawakened ghosts of her past. And ChangezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own identity is in seismic shift as well, unearthing allegiances more fundamental than money, power, and maybe even love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4c339c9db97b5667431fefca59c18defe034d5","amp;dn":"The+Reluctant+Fundamentalist+-+Mohsin+Hamid.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4c339c9db97b5667431fefca59c18defe034d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,76,51,156,157,185,123,86,103,67,31,239,202,89,193,141,239,224,52,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
