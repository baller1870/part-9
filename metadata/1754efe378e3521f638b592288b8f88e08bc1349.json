I loved it.â€ â€”Stephen King\r\nA gritty and suspenseful Boston thriller for fans of Dennis Lehane and The Departed\r\nAn extraordinary thrillerâ€”gripping, haunting, and marvelously toldâ€”about two friends growing up in a rapidly changing Boston, who must face the sins of their past in the midst of a series of brutal murders.\r\nâ€œYou came back here to bury your past. . . . Thing is, you gotta kill it first.â€\r\nKevin Pearceâ€”baseball star, honor student, the pride of Brightonâ€”was fifteen when he left town in the back of his uncleâ€™s cab. He and his buddy Bobby Scales had just committed heinous violence for what they thought were the best of reasons. Kevin didnâ€™t want a pass, but he was getting it anyway. Bobby would stay and face the music; Kevinâ€™s future would remain bright as ever. At least that was the way things were supposed to work, except in Brighton things never work the way theyâ€™re supposed to.\r\nTwenty-six years later, Kevin is a Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning journalist for the Boston Globe. Heâ€™s never been back to his old block, having avoided his family and, especially, Bobby Scales. Then he learns his old friend is the prime suspect in a string of local murders. Suddenly, Kevinâ€™s headed homeâ€”to protect a friend and the secret they share. To report this story to the end and protect those he loves, he must face not only an elusive, slippery killer, but his own corrupted conscience.\r\nA powerhouse of a thriller, Brighton is a riveting and elegiac exploration of promises broken, debts owed, and old wrongs made right . . . no matter what the cost","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1754efe378e3521f638b592288b8f88e08bc1349","amp;dn":"Brighton+A+Novel+%28Michael+Harvey%29+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1754efe378e3521f638b592288b8f88e08bc1349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,84,239,227,120,227,82,31,99,139,89,34,136,184,248,142,8,188,19,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
