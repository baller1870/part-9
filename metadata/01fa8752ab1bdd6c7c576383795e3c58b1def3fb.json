Can it withstand rocket thrusts and the vacuum of space? This do-it-yourself guide helps you conduct a series of hands-on tests designed to check your satelliteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s readiness. Learn precisely what the craft and its electronic components must endure if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re to function properly in Low Earth Orbit.\n\n\tThe perfect follow-up to DIY Satellite Platforms (our primer for designing and building a picosatellite), this book also provides an overview of what space is like and how orbits work, enabling you to set up the launch and orbit support youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need.\n\n  * Go deep into the numbers that describe conditions your satellite will face\n  * Learn how to mitigate the risks of radiation in the ionosphere\n  * Pick up enough formal systems engineering to understand what the tests are\n    all about\n  * Build a thermal vacuum chamber for mimicking environment of space\n  * Simulate the rocket launch by building and running a vibration shake test\n  * Use a homebuilt centrifuge to conduct high G-force tests\n  * Get guidelines on scheduling tests and choosing an appropriate lab or clean\n    room","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01fa8752ab1bdd6c7c576383795e3c58b1def3fb","amp;dn":"O%27Reilly+-+Surviving+Orbit+The+DIY+Way+-+Maker+Press+%5BPDF%7CePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01fa8752ab1bdd6c7c576383795e3c58b1def3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,250,135,82,171,27,221,108,124,87,99,131,121,94,60,88,177,222,243,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
