He is at first a hot-tempered, selfish youth - but then, &amp;#039;Rahman&amp;#039;, an illegal Afghanistan imigrant, comes to work. He is a young, weak worker, and is at once put in Latif&amp;#039;s job - and Rahman does a better job, too. Jealous and angry, Latif tries to make life miserable for his new adversary... until he accidentally discovers that &amp;#039;Rahman&amp;#039; is not a boy - &amp;#039;Rahman&amp;#039; is &amp;#039;Baran&amp;#039;, a woman.\n\nLatif, who even though used to be a careless youth, always had a soft, romantic spot in his heart - and when he realizes Baran is a woman, he falls in love with her. He seeks to protect and help her, and his entire life is slowly and surely changed for the better because of her.\n\nMany people have critisized this film, saying it&amp;#039;s poorly acted, the script is badly written, etc. Please remember: this is not a Hollywood movie! This movie is not in the least bit American, therefore the viewer needs to be open minded to the different culture of Iranian cinema. Baran never says a single word in the entire film. &amp;#039;BARAN&amp;#039; is a beautiful romantic drama filled with angst and stunning visual scapes. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. \n\n~~~~~~ Baran.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,198,028,800                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:35:44                \nFrame Count:....................................137714             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................368                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.913                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1531                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.246&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................32                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2  \n\n------my rip---very nice I think---\n\nI&amp;#039;m looking for quality DVD sources to rip , get in touch if you have something nive to offer. :)   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a27adb0a8576f43a2905bb1e73fc03e52c60fa8","amp;dn":"Majid+Majidi+-+Baran+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a27adb0a8576f43a2905bb1e73fc03e52c60fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,39,173,176,168,87,111,67,162,144,91,177,231,63,192,62,82,198,15,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
