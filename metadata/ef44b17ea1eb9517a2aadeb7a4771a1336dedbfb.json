However, if you fell \nin love with it first time around, be prepared to fall in love all over again. \n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because, while the original impOSCar was a component emulation of the rare and \nclassic OSCar synthesizer with a few added bells and whistles, such as polyphony and \non-board effects, impOSCar2 soars to new sonic heights via steroid injections of innovative \nfeatures and enhancements, each designed around the wishes of those musicians, \nprogrammers and producers who loved the original.\n\nSince the original impOSCar release weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve carefully compiled user feedback and over the \ncourse of eighteen months, in another true labour of love, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve incorporated the best of \nthese within impOSCar2 creating a synth that positively oozes more character, more play-\nability, more expression and more detailed sound sculpting opportunities than could have \nbeen imagined a few years ago. \n\nEffects version\n\nHowever, given the sonic excellence and character of the impOSCarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary multimode \nfilters, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurprising that the single biggest request was for an Effect version. Along with \nthe instrument version, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re delighted to say thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what you get with the impOSCar2. \n\nProcessing drums, vocals, or any other audio source through the filters, envelopes, ring \nmodulator and along with the multiple modulation choices the impOSCar2 affords, is \nguaranteed to unlock its serious sonic potential. For certain hosts, including Logic, \nthereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a side-chained MIDI Controlled Effect available enabling you to even \nroute audio through the arpeggiator.\n\nfuture-dada.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef44b17ea1eb9517a2aadeb7a4771a1336dedbfb","amp;dn":"GForce+-+impOSCar2+v2.0.2+-+AU.OSX+-+packet+-+dada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef44b17ea1eb9517a2aadeb7a4771a1336dedbfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,68,177,126,161,235,149,23,162,170,222,183,164,119,26,19,54,222,219,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
