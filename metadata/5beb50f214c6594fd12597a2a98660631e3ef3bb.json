From the preparation of the victim to the disposal of the body, Execution answers all the questions you are ever likely to ask, and some you would never want to imagine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5beb50f214c6594fd12597a2a98660631e3ef3bb","amp;dn":"Execution+-+A+Guide+to+the+Ultimate+Penalty+%282012%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5beb50f214c6594fd12597a2a98660631e3ef3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,235,80,242,20,198,89,79,209,37,151,162,169,134,96,99,30,62,243,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
