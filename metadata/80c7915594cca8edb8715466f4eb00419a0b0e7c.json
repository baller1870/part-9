A woman (Aurore Clement) deliberates on placing a telephone call to an absent lover before deciding to hail a taxicab to his apartment. A man and a woman sitting at adjacent tables of an anonymous bar exchange reluctant, fleeting glances as they wait in vain for their respective lovers to arrive, and eventually succumb to an impulsive, awkward embrace. An unconcerned young woman smokes a cigarette as she sits in a diner with two young men before being confronted to choose between them. A hurried man misses an opportunity to meet his lover outside her home. A middle-aged couple awaken to the noise of an off-the-air television set and decide to go out for the evening. A woman hurriedly packs her belongings into a suitcase and sneaks out of the apartment only to return home at dawn to her oblivious, sleeping husband. Lovers consummate their relationship or part to their separate ways at entrances and stairwells of impersonal apartment buildings.\n\nChantal Akerman presents a structurally challenging, yet emotionally honest, understatedly humorous, and visually compelling choreography of motion, rhythm, and passion in Toute une nuit. Using short takes, minimal dialogue, and fragmented narrative, Akerman distills the visual narrative into the brief, yet essential moments that define the spectrum of human interaction: separation, attraction, reconciliation, reunion, intimacy, absence, rejection. Filmed as a narcoleptic journey through a sultry and languorous evening in summertime Brussels, Toute une nuit becomes a subtle and relevant validation on the singularity of human existence - a chronicle of the irrepressible passion and vitality that lay beneath the surface of an alienating urban landscape. \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\nDVDrip\n\nFile Name .........................................: Chantal AKERMAN - 1982 - Toute une nuit.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,541,150,720 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:26:52\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x384 (AR: 1.667)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2100 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.342 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c7915594cca8edb8715466f4eb00419a0b0e7c","amp;dn":"Toute+Une+Nuit+%2F+A+Whole+Night+%28Chantal+Akerman+-+1982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c7915594cca8edb8715466f4eb00419a0b0e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,199,145,85,148,204,168,237,184,113,84,102,244,235,0,65,154,11,14,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
