During the series' first episode, he meets embittered ex-policeman Mark Gordon (as Jonathan is walking along a little-used road, on which Mark happens to be driving). Jonathan helps reform Mark, with the grateful Mark agreeing to become Jonathan's right-hand associate in carrying out the heavenly mission. The two begin traveling the country as itinerant workers, receiving assignments from &quot;the Boss&quot; (an unseen associate only Jonathan could communicate with), with their mission being to deliver love, understanding and humility to the people they encountered. Typical episodes stressed moral, Christian themes; though many episodes dealt with common human failings, such as egotism, bitterness and greed, some shows addressed such topics as racism and cancer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c3582a7bfcf207bf68df2ddc460e5f65771816","amp;dn":"High+Heaven+Season+5+%28DVDrip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c3582a7bfcf207bf68df2ddc460e5f65771816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,195,88,42,123,252,242,7,191,104,223,45,220,70,14,95,101,119,24,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
