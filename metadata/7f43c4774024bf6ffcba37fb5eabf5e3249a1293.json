Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand) is a plain and pudgy middle-aged college English professor who shares a house with her mother, Hannah (Lauren Bacall). Rose got the brains in her family, but her sister Claire (Mimi Rogers) got the good looks, and as Claire prepares for her wedding to Alex (Pierce Brosnon), Rose can't help but despair over the blank page that is her love life, especially since she's long had a crush on Alex. Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) teaches mathematics at the same school as Rose, and he has come to the conclusion that sex serves no purpose but to complicate relationships between men and women; after a series of disastrous romantic affairs, Gregory is looking for an intellectual relationship with a woman -- and nothing more. One day, Gregory passes by Rose's lecture hall as she discusses the role of chaste love in literature, and he's intrigued; he takes her out on a date and is impressed by Rose's quick wit and broad range of knowledge. Gregory is so taken with Rose that he proposes marriage, but under the condition that theirs be strictly a meeting of the minds, without sexual relations. While Rose is very much attracted to the handsome mathematician, the prospect of spending the rest of her life either alone or with Hannah seems far worse than a marriage without passion, and she agrees to his proposal. However, Rose's affection for Gregory makes it difficult for her to stop with a handshake, and one night she puts on her best nightgown and attempts to seduce her husband, much to Gregory's annoyance and confusion. Gregory leaves on a lecture tour shortly afterward, and after Hannah reassures a heartbroken Rose that she was beautiful as a child, Rose goes on a crash course in self improvement. She goes on a diet, starts working out, changes her hairstyle, learns a few makeup tricks, and revamps her wardrobe, and by the time Gregory returns, he discovers that there's a very different woman in the twin bed next to his own. The Mirror Has Two Faces, based on the 1958 French comedy Le Miror a Deux Faces, was Barbra Streisand's third project as a director; she also served as co-producer and helped compose the film's theme song, &quot;I Finally Found Someone.&quot;\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\n- Duration: 2h 6mn\r\n\r\n- Nominal bit rate: 1119 Kbps\r\n\r\n- Res: 1280 x 720\r\n\r\n- AR: 16:9\r\n\r\n- FPS: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n- Audio: AAC, 2 channels, 128Kbps\r\n\r\n************************************\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n------------\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\r\nFile size : 1.11 GiB\r\nDuration : 2h 6mn\r\nOverall bit rate : 1259 Kbps\r\nEncoded date : UTC 2015-10-11 22:05:13\r\nWriting application : mkvmerge v8.4.0 ('A better way to fly') 64bit\r\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.1 + libmatroska v1.4.2\r\n\r\nVideo\r\n----------\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nDuration : 2h 6mn\r\nNominal bit rate : 1119 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.051\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142\r\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=4\r\nDefault : Yes\r\nForced : No\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n----------\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : A_AAC\r\nDuration : 2h 6mn\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nTitle : Stereo\r\nLanguage : English\r\nDefault : Yes\r\nForced : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f43c4774024bf6ffcba37fb5eabf5e3249a1293","amp;dn":"The+Mirror+Has+Two+Faces+1996+720p+HDRip+x264+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f43c4774024bf6ffcba37fb5eabf5e3249a1293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,67,196,119,64,36,191,111,252,186,55,251,94,171,245,227,36,154,18,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
