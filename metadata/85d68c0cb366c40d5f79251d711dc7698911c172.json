With the CD selling out fast and their reputation spreading like a wildfire through the underground, the duo knew they would need a fuller line-up to move the band up and forward.\n\nSo, bassist Guillaume Le Huche (aka Israphel Wing) was enlisted to their ranks, enabling them to perform live in concert for the first time in their career.\n\n\nCBR: 320k CD-Rip\n\n\nEight Full-Lenght\n\nSwedish and vinyl edition bonus track:\n12.
