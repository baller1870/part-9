Promotional info for the collected edition - &quot;OMAC robots are rampaging, magic is dying, villains are uniting, and a war is raging in space. And in the middle of it all, a critical moment has divided Earth's three greatest heroes: Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. It's the DCU's darkest day, and long-lost heroes from the past have returned to make things right in the universe...at any cost. Heroes will live, heroes will die, and the DCU will never be the same again! This exhaustive volume contains every cover and variant produced for the project, annotations, character designs, excerpts from scripts, unused scenes, and much more!&quot;\n\nThis is each of the seven individual issues in digital-HD by Monafekk-Empire. There are collected one-volume digital editions as well; I just prefer the look of this in HR. Thanks to Monafekk for their work, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64622c71a296626192bdda77fe55dfa4cf2f160","amp;dn":"Infinite+Crisis+01-07+%282005-2006%7CDigital-HD%7CMonafekk-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64622c71a296626192bdda77fe55dfa4cf2f160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,70,34,199,26,41,102,38,25,43,221,167,127,229,93,250,76,242,241,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
