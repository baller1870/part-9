The main characters are Rudina, the oldest daughter, and Nik, the oldest son. Both have a pretty normal life. Rudina is an A-student in high-school and Nik very popular. He just fell in love with one of his fellow students. Their father earns the families income with a little bread delivery service. For that he uses a short cut through the neighbours ground, but the neighbour doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t necessarily like that. But the ground had actually belonged to RudinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and NikÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family once. One day the conflict escalates and the neighbour gets killed by RudinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and NikÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father and their uncle. Because only their uncle gets caught by the police and their father is able to hide, the old law of blood feud is against the family. They cannot leave their house. Only the women of the family are allowed to leave the house. So Rudina has to quit school and continue the bread delivery service of the fatherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10 from 551 users\nDirected by: Joshua Marston\nStarring: Tristan Halilaj, Sindi Lacej and Refet Abazi\n\nRelease Name: The.Forgiveness.of.Blood.2011.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-ESPiSE\nSize: 1.4 GB\nVideo: AVI | 624Ãƒâ€”336 | 1701 kbps\nAudio: Albanian | AC3 | 448 kbps\nRuntime: 110 MIN\nSubtitle: English\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/x7jPh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/x7jPh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/QFVBu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/QFVBu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/mOVsL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/mOVsL.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/HqSu8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/HqSu8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0375511ed353985f2ee13af6c54e78d84723f453","amp;dn":"The+Forgiveness+of+Blood+2011+LIMITED+DVDRip+XviD-ESPiSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0375511ed353985f2ee13af6c54e78d84723f453","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,117,81,30,211,83,152,95,46,225,58,246,197,78,120,216,71,35,244,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
