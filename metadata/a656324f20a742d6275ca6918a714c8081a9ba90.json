Its arias are instantly recognisable and have become staples for opera houses across the globe. Yet at its London premiere in 1856, La traviata was denounced for bringing 'the poetry of the brothel' to the stage and unleashing uncomfortable truths on Victorian society.\r\nAmanda Vickery and Tom Service reveal the extraordinary story behind the opera's first night in London and its scandalous heroine, the courtesan Violetta ValÃ©ry, whose dramatic life and tragic death were based on real-life characters and events. Tom and Amanda's journey goes from the luxury of the Parisian demi-monde to the teeming streets of Victorian London, where prostitution was seen as a threat to society itself. Amanda explores the story of Marie Duplessis, a highly-prized courtesan whose life inspired the play on which the opera was based, whilst Tom discovers how Verdi, on a visit to Paris with his mistress soprano Giuseppina Strepponi, seized this risquÃ© story for the subject of his new masterpiece. Together, Amanda and Tom follow the opera's journey to London and examine how its incendiary premiere marked a historic moment in which art confronted reality, redefining the role of the opera diva forever.\r\nScenes from Verdi's masterpiece have been specially recreated for the film alongside location photography in Venice, Milan, Paris and London.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/53/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/La-Traviata-Love-Death-and-Divas-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2041Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 922 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b060cdrm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a656324f20a742d6275ca6918a714c8081a9ba90","amp;dn":"BBC+La+Traviata+Love+Death+and+Divas+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a656324f20a742d6275ca6918a714c8081a9ba90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,86,50,79,32,167,66,214,39,92,166,145,138,113,76,128,129,169,186,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
