Jack lives with his Ma in Room, which has a locked door and a skylight, and measures 11 feet by 11 feet. He loves watching TV, and the cartoon characters he calls friends, but he knows that nothing he sees on screen is truly real - only him, Ma and the things in Room. Until the day Ma admits that there\\'s a world outside ...Told in Jack\\'s voice, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Room\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is the story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible. Unsentimental and sometimes funny, devastating yet uplifting, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Room\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is a novel like no other. \\'Emma Donoghue\\'s writing is superb alchemy, changing innocence into horror and horror into tenderness. \\&quot;Room\\&quot; is a book to read in one sitting. When it\\'s over you look up: the world looks the same but you are somehow different and that feeling lingers for days\\' - Audrey Niffenegger. \n\\&quot;Room\\&quot; is one of the most profoundly affecting books I\\'ve read in a long time. Jack moved me greatly. His voice, his story, his innocence, his love for Ma combine to create something very unusual and, I think, something very important ...\\&quot;Room\\&quot; deserves to reach the widest possible audience - John Boyne. \nI loved \\&quot;Room\\&quot;.Such incredible imagination, and dazzling use of language. And with all this, an entirely credible, endearing little boy. It\\'s unlike anything I\\'ve ever read before - Anita Shreve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42730215bfb58c2e4cb0937279decd25946d95a0","amp;dn":"Room+by+Emma+Donoghue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42730215bfb58c2e4cb0937279decd25946d95a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,115,2,21,191,181,140,46,76,176,147,114,121,222,205,37,148,109,149,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
