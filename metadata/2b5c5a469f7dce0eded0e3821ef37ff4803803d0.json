The only track to feature any guitar was &quot;Power Of Love&quot; which featured fellow labelmate Ronnie Montrose on electric guitar.\n\nThe album's success was a slow but steady accomplishment as the album eventually peaked at #7 on Billboard album chart in the Spring of 1976. The album's title cut and &quot;Love is Alive&quot; both peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5c5a469f7dce0eded0e3821ef37ff4803803d0","amp;dn":"Gary+Wright%2FDream+Weaver+%5BLE%5D%5B2011%5D%5B24KGoldHDCD%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5c5a469f7dce0eded0e3821ef37ff4803803d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,92,90,70,159,125,206,14,222,208,227,130,30,243,127,244,128,56,3,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
