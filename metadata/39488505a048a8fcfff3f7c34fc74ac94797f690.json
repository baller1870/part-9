An absurd predicament, witty banter, a group of hilariously dysfunctional people: it all seems so easy. But is it? If you've ever said 'I can do better than that', then this book will encourage, test and pull you through the sitcom-writing boot camp. Comedy guru Marc Blake has written for Spitting Image, Frankie Howerd and Craig Charles, and had his own TV show and BBC Radio 4 series Whining for England. The author of several humour books and comic novels including the bestselling Sunstroke, he has taught comedy writing across the UK for ten years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39488505a048a8fcfff3f7c34fc74ac94797f690","amp;dn":"How+to+be+a+Sitcom+Writer%3A+Secrets+from+the+Inside+-+Marc+Blake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39488505a048a8fcfff3f7c34fc74ac94797f690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,72,133,5,160,72,168,252,255,243,247,195,79,199,74,201,71,151,246,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
