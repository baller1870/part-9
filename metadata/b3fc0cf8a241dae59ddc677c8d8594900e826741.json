It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic problem/solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.\n\nThe idea of service-oriented architecture is an easy one to grasp and yet developers and enterprise architects often struggle with implementation issues. Here are some of them:\n\n- How to get high availability and high performance\n- How to know a service has failed\n- How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services\n- How to make loose coupling looser\n- How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers\n- How to integrate SOA and the UI\n\nSOA Patterns provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others, using plain language. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll understand the design patterns that promote and enforce flexibility, availability, and scalability. Each of the 26 patterns uses the classic problem/solution format and a unique technology map to show where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.\n\nWritten for working developers and architects building services and service-oriented solutions. Knowledge of Java or C# is helpful but not required.\n\nTable of Contents\nPart I: SOA patterns\nChapter 1. Solving SOA pains with patterns\nChapter 2. Foundation structural patterns\nChapter 3.
