Of course the guitar leads, because \nthat is the composer's instrument of choice. On this first volume it \nshould be noted that there is only the original short version of said \ntheme. The original pieces include an ambiguity for harp and strings \n(&quot;Oxfordshire Country Home&quot;), a contemplative piano's plodding (&quot;Morse \nOn The Case&quot;), eerie wind effects backed by doom-laden strings (&quot;Macabre \nPursuit&quot;) and a piano and woodwind duet for the ever put-upon &quot;Lewis&quot;. \nSuiting and soothing the detective's turbulent thoughts are the \nfollowing classics: Mozart's Laudate Dominum and the &quot;Overture&quot; from The \nMagic Flute, Puccini's &quot;Senza Mamma&quot; and Mendelssohn's Lieder Ohne \nWorte, Op. 67. If you have the means to play it in a red jaguar, this \nalbum is a must.\n\nTrack List:\n01. Barrington Pheloung ~ Inspector Morse (Main Theme - Opening Titles)\n02.
