Sticking mostly to an exquisite after-hours mode, Brown delivers one smooth blues gem after another until this 20-track disc comes to a close. Backed for the most part by guitarist Johnny Moore and his Three Blazers, Brown effortlessly lays down such standouts as the title track, &quot;Black Night,&quot; and &quot;Get Yourself Another Fool.&quot; Yes, the mood here is evocative of Nat Cole's classic trio sides, but Brown and Moore -- unlike Cole, infuse their lush surroundings with a healthy dose of sophisticated West Coast blues. Capped off with the original version of Brown's classic Yuletide cut &quot;Merry Christmas Baby,&quot; Driftin' Blues is the perfect way to get cozy with this venerable blues performer.
