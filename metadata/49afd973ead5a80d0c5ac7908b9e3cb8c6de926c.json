Jesus said he came not to abolish that faith but to fulfill it. In this book, we see that fullness down to the smallest details. I treasure this book.&quot; -Mike Aquilina, author of The Fathers of the Church \r\n \r\n&quot;Such sparkling insights appear on almost every page, as Taylor Marshall deftly compares various features of Judaism to their Catholic counterparts: the priesthood, vestments, holy days, marriage, and saints, to name but a few. Saint Augustine's dictum, &quot;The New Covenant is in the Old, concealed; the Old Covenant is in the New, revealed&quot; is on full display inThe Crucified Rabbi.&quot; -Cale Clarke, Catholic Insight Magazine \r\n \r\n&quot;This is a fascinating book full of interesting details. The Crucified Rabbi should be required reading for every student of the Catholic faith.&quot; -Father Dwight Longenecker, author of Mary: A Catholic/Evangelical Debate \r\n\r\n    How does Jesus fulfill over three hundred Old Testament Prophecies? {over 300 Hebrew prophecies of Christ and the Church listed inside this book} \r\n    Is Catholicism inherently Anti-Semitic? Do the Hebrew Scriptures accurately predict Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah?\r\n    How does Jewish thinking presuppose devotion to Mary?\r\n    Is the Catholic Church a fulfillment of historic Israel?\r\n    How do Jewish water rituals relate to Catholic baptism?\r\n    Is the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass a Passover meal?\r\n    Should the Catholic priesthood conform to the priesthood established by Moses?\r\n    How has the Jewish Temple influenced traditional Christian architecture?\r\n    Does the Pope wear a yarmulke?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Perspective on Paul: Paul and the Origins of Catholic Christianity\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a complete and simple Catholic resource to equip you to answer your Protestant friends about salvation, faith and works, baptism, the Eucharist, the sacraments, the priesthood, celibacy, and redemptive suffering, then this new book is for you. This book intends to show once and for all that Saint Paul was thoroughly Catholic, and that Protestant and liberal prejudices against the Catholic perspective on Paul are unwarranted. If we read Paul in his own words, we find none other than the great Catholic Apostle of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eternal City: Rome &amp; the Origins of Catholic Christianity\r\n\r\nRead this book if you have ever wondered why the Catholic Church specifically claims to be Roman? It would seem that the Church of Jesus Christ would be centered in Jerusalem, the capital of the Jews, since Christ died and rose again in Jerusalem. Catholic theologian Taylor Marshall, Ph.D. provides a layman's account of how Christ chose the Rome as an instrument of redemption for the nations. Beginning with the Old Testament prophets, Dr. Marshall explains how the Messiah would come and assume reign over the nations through the Roman Empire. This book provides an exciting and popular account establishing Rome as 'the Eternal City' of Christ the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49afd973ead5a80d0c5ac7908b9e3cb8c6de926c","amp;dn":"Taylor+Marshall+-+Origins+of+Catholic+Christianity+Book+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49afd973ead5a80d0c5ac7908b9e3cb8c6de926c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,175,217,115,234,213,168,13,12,90,199,144,139,158,60,184,198,222,146,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
