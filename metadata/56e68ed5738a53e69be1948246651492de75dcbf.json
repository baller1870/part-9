Facts On File's seven-volume Encyclopedia of World History is a truly groundbreaking work and one of the first to offer a balanced presentation of human history for a global perspective on the past. A team of distinguished world history academics has brought together scores of specialists in writing signed entries based on the latest scholarship.\n\nBased on the National Standards for World History\n\nInfluenced by the National Standards for World History, this comprehensive and authoritative set is rich in features to make the study of world history easier for students to understand. Arranged in six chronological eras that span prehistory to the present day, its chronological approach follows the way world history is taught and studied in the classroom. Each volume era begins with essays that address large themesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as agriculture, science and technology, social and class relationships, trade and cultural exchanges, and warfareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½allowing students to make connections and trace key global patterns over time. The final volume contains primary source documents and a master index for the set.\n\nKey Features That Enhance the Set's Reference Value\n\n* Thematic essays that help students make comparisons and connections across regions and time periods\n* Primary source documents, carefully chosen to be representative of the six world eras\n* Informative, cross-referenced entries\n* A chronology in every volume that helps students place events in context\n* More than 600 illustrations, including a 32-page insert of full-color maps in each volume designed to convey the importance of geography in world history\n* Further reading sections that encourage additional research\n* Individual volume indexes\n* A comprehensive set index.\n\nThe Set Is Arranged in Six Chronological Eras\n\n* Volume I: The Ancient World: Prehistoric Eras to 600 CE\n* Volume II: The Expanding World: 600 CE to 1450\n* Volume III: The First Global Age: 1450 to 1750\n* Volume IV: Age of Revolution and Empire: 1750 to 1900\n* Volume V: Crisis and Achievement: 1900 to 1950\n* Volume VI: The Contemporary World: 1950 to the Present\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e68ed5738a53e69be1948246651492de75dcbf","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+World+History%2C+6-Volume+Set+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e68ed5738a53e69be1948246651492de75dcbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,230,142,213,115,138,83,230,155,225,148,130,70,101,20,146,222,117,220,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
