An event that together with the historical events of Spain and of the Francoism, will mark forever his imagination and will influence his future experiences as a director.\n\nThis short film was specifically done by VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ctor Erice to be shown at the exhibition 'Erice - Kiarostami. Correspondences', held at the Centre de Cultura ContemporÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â nia de Barcelona from 9 February to 21 May 2006.\n\n\nGeneral: C:La.Morte.Rouge.2006.Erice.TVRip.VOSIt.H264.AC3-[Gorchakov].mkv\nFormat: Matroska at 2 194Kbps\nLength: 519MB for 33min. 3seg. 872ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 2 000Kbps\nAspect: 720 x 544 (1.324) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0: AC-3 at 192Kbps\nInfos: 2canales, 48,0KHz\n\n\nNot My rip.
