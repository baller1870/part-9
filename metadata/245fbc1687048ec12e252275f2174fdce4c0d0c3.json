Either way, since his death, his stature as a serious composer has grown. Lumpy Gravy missed most by a mile ... Full Descriptionbecause it was the first of Zappa's 'challenging' orchestral pieces, and not what his audience had come to expect. \n\nPerformed by the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus, it was a lengthy instrumental suite broken up by equally 'challenging' dialogue. On the back cover, Frank looks out and asks, 'is this phase 2 of We're Only In It For The Money?'. No, we don't think so.\n\nRanked #23 in Mojo's &quot;The 50 Most Out There Albums Of All Time&quot;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
