It contains a wealth of illustrations, \nstep-by-step descriptions of algorithms, examples and practice problems, \nwhich make it an ideal textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate students, \nas well as a useful self-study tool for researchers and professionals. \nPrinciples of lossless compression are covered, as are various entropy \ncoding techniques, including Huffman coding, arithmetic coding and Lempel-Ziv \ncoding. Scalar and vector quantization and trellis coding are thoroughly \nexplained, and a full chapter is devoted to mathematical transformations \nincluding the KLT, DCT and wavelet transforms. The workings of transform and \nsubband/wavelet coding systems, including JPEG2000 and SBHP image compression \nand H.264/AVC video compression, are explained and a unique chapter is \nprovided on set partition coding, shedding new light on SPIHT, SPECK, EZW \nand related methods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6880bf18857f352b50514262f122017a9d897c","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+Digital+Signal+Compression+2011+Retai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6880bf18857f352b50514262f122017a9d897c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,104,128,191,24,133,127,53,43,80,81,66,98,241,34,1,122,157,137,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
