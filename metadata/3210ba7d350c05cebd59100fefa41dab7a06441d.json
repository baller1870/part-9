Eschewing the dull path carved out for him by his wealthy southern family, the easy-going Craig teams up with an ambitious real estate developer in Birmingham, Alabama. In an attempt to wrest a piece of property away from its owner, Craig poses as a member of a seedy gym. But this rich boy soon finds himself taking a genuine fancy to the colorful collection of characters he meets thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in particular, bodybuilder Joe Santo (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his first major screen role), who is training for the Mr. Universe title, and spunky blue-collar babe Mary Tate (Sally Field), the gymÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s receptionist. The film, based on the novel by Charles Gaines, is lighthearted, unlike RafelsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s austere earlier classics (FIVE EASY PIECES and KING OF MARVIN GARDENS) but deals with many of the same themes, such as dysfunctional families, restlessness, and rebellion.\n\nRatings: IMDB 5.8/10 (1,236 votes) | RT: 83% | MC: n/a\nGenre: Drama | Comedy\nDirected by: Bob Rafelson\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, Sally Field, Arnold Schwarzenegger, R.G.
