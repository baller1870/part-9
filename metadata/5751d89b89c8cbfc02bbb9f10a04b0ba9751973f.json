The characters were created by Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging firm, and the books have been written by many different ghostwriters over the years. The books are published under the collective pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon.\n\nThe Hardy Boys are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. They live in the city of Bayport on Barmet Bay with their father, detective Fenton Hardy, their mother, Laura Hardy, and their Aunt Gertrude. Frank, the older brother, is eighteen (sixteen in earlier versions), and his younger brother Joe is seventeen (fifteen in earlier versions). The brothers nominally attend high school in Bayport, where they are in the same grade, but school is rarely mentioned in the books and never hinders the HardyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in solving mysteries. In the older stories, the Hardy Boys' cases often are linked to the confidential cases their detective father is working on. He sometimes asks them for help, while at other times they stumble upon villains and incidents that are connected to his cases. The Hardy Boys are sometimes assisted in solving mysteries by their friends Chet Morton, Phil Cohen, Biff Hooper, Jerry Gilroy, and Tony Prito, and, less frequently, by their platonic girlfriends Callie Shaw and Iola Morton (Chet's sister).\n\nThe Hardy Boys are constantly involved in adventure and action. Despite frequent danger, the boys &quot;Never lose their nerve ... They are hardy boys, luckier and more clever than anyone around them.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5751d89b89c8cbfc02bbb9f10a04b0ba9751973f","amp;dn":"The+Hardy+Boys+Series+-+Franklin+W.+Dixon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5751d89b89c8cbfc02bbb9f10a04b0ba9751973f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,81,216,155,137,200,203,252,2,187,185,241,10,4,176,186,151,81,151,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
