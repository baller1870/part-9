Conversion is &quot;almost&quot; perfect with the exception of footnotes which might appear in the middle of text and smaller errors like missing first letters of a chapter etc. (It would be too much to hand-edit the entire book and correct those things)\n\nAlso added the long instruction which was in a later edition of the book since the original PDF didn't have the instruction.\n\nDESC:\n\nIn this perennial bestseller, Seth challenges our assumptions about the nature of reality. He explains how the conscious mind directs unconscious activity and has at its command all the powers of the inner self. Included are excellent exercises for applying these theories to any life situation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4536d10acf82cbde674dd62a95cf3282364faddf","amp;dn":"The+Nature+Of+Personal+Reality+-+Jane+Roberts+-+A+Seth+Book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4536d10acf82cbde674dd62a95cf3282364faddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,54,209,10,207,130,203,222,103,77,214,42,149,207,50,130,54,79,173,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
