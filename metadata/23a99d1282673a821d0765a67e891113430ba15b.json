Shortly after the defeat of [Majin Buu], [Beerus], the God of Destruction, awakens after a long slumber. After hearing rumors of a Saiyajin warrior who defeated [Freezer], he tracks down that warrior, [Son Gokuu]. Excited at the prospect of a new challenge, Gokuu faces him in battle, only to be quickly overwhelmed by his power and defeated shortly thereafter. Realizing the threat Beerus poses to the entire universe, Gokuu and his friends must find a way to stop him before it`s too late. Source: ANN Note: This film is set between the 517th and 518th chapters of the original manga, specifically during the lost decade of story time after the end of the battle with Majin Buu.\n\n\n\n(FIX)\nQuote:\n00:26:39\nFIX laughter at 00.26.40 and or remove \nother laughter not fix\n\n\nQuote:\nThe english audio is ripped from movie theaters , so you will hear laughter at some points throughout.\n\n\nDragon Ball Z Battle Of Gods 2013 1080p-720p BluRay-(x264)-(Dual-Audio)[DragonVsKira] (FIX)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23a99d1282673a821d0765a67e891113430ba15b","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z+Battle+Of+Gods+2013+1080p-720p+BluRay-%28x264%29-%28Dual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23a99d1282673a821d0765a67e891113430ba15b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,169,157,18,130,103,58,130,29,7,101,166,126,137,17,19,67,11,161,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
