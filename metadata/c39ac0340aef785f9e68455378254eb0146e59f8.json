I used this pack to 'harden' the mod section of the soundpatch and still have it on my disks. Since the download is not available anymore, and it's no good if just I have this pack sitting on my disk, I decided to make it available for download again, it's a big 6-part 5.2GB download, but then you get all of them.\n\ntaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=848215&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDarkjeThe2nd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39ac0340aef785f9e68455378254eb0146e59f8","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+1%2C+Ultimate+Mod+Pack%2C+400%2B+Mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39ac0340aef785f9e68455378254eb0146e59f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,154,192,52,10,239,120,95,158,104,69,83,120,37,78,176,20,110,89,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
