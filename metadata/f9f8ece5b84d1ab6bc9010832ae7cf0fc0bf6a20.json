Each storyline also has a corresponding campaign difficulty but the gameplay difficulty can be changed independently. Each campaign has its own set of heroes and special units that corresponds with the campaigns theme. The defensive buildings will also change depending on the level and campaign. The modes are as follows:\n\nKing Arthur (Easy): This storyline follows King Arthur and his Knights of The Round Table. Merlin frequently becomes a necessary part of the campaign. The first two missions of this campaign must be completed before choosing another storyline. The environment found in this storyline is lush and vibrant with plenty of trees.\n\nIce (Medium): This storyline follows Siegfried of Xanten and his conquest in the snowy north. The environment is almost completely covered in snow and dragons frequently nest in the hills around the map. This campaign is harder due to more hazards from special units as well as the Frost Giants present throughout much of the campaign. The special units of this campaign are frost themed with corresponding abilties.\n\nEvil (Hard): This storyline follows Count Vladislav Dracul (A.K.A. Vlad the Impaler). The environment of this campaign is a dead land that has been corrupted. This campaign includes various new special units for Vlad but few appear on the enemies side. Vlad's campaign is challenging due to enormous amounts of enemy knights and pikemen as well as large requirements that must be met to advance into the next level. The special units of this campaign are werewolves, demons, and various corrupted creatures as well as new siege weaponry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9f8ece5b84d1ab6bc9010832ae7cf0fc0bf6a20","amp;dn":"Stronghold+Legends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9f8ece5b84d1ab6bc9010832ae7cf0fc0bf6a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,248,236,229,184,77,26,182,188,144,16,131,42,231,207,15,192,191,106,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
