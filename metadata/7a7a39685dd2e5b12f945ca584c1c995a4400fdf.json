Provides the best code autocompletion, refactorings, on-the-fly error prevention, supports language mixtures and more.\n\nCode Quality Analysis\nHundreds of inspections take care of verifying your code as you type, analyzing the whole project. PHPDoc support, code (re)arranger, code formatter, PHP Code Sniffer &amp; Mess Detector, quick-fixes and other features help you write neat code thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to support.\n\nDevelopment Environment\nPerform many routine tasks right from the IDE, thanks to VCS integration (Git, SVN, etc.), local history, support for remote deployment, remote PHP interpreters, Behat, SQL and databases, command-line tools, Vagrant, Composer, built-in REST Client and SSH Console with remote tools.\n\nDebugging and Testing\nZero-configuration debugging makes it really easy to debug your applications, especially with debugger configuration validation. PHPUnit support lets you develop and run unit tests right from the IDE. Profile your applications with Xdebug or Zend Debugger and check aggregated reports in PhpStorm.\n\nHTML/CSS/JavaScript Editor\nAll the cutting edge front-end technologies are supported, including HTML5, CSS, Sass, SCSS, Less, Stylus, Compass, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, ECMAScript Harmony, Jade, Emmet, and of course JavaScript, with refactorings, debugging and unit-testing. There is also Live Edit to see changes instantly in your browser.\n\nCross-platform Experience\nUse the same frequently-updated PHP integrated development environment on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux with your single license key. Enjoy the performance and stability!\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new in PhpStorm 8?\n\nLaravelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blade templates\nTake advantage of LaravelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blade templates editing. Highlighting of syntax in template files, code completion for directives, Blade-specific navigation, and more.\n\nPower of language injections\nLanguage injections into PHP literals have been completely re-worked to support complex expressions, including a possibility to substitute dynamic parts with sensible values. This is particularly important for working with SQL queries in your project, and yields a significant productivity boost when writing or testing database queries.\n\nPHP 5.6 support in PhpStorm 8\nPhpStorm 8 comes with PHP 5.6 support. With this latest PHP version released end of August, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to keep you from using new language features like exponentiation via **, use function and use const, constant expressions, variadic functions, argument unpacking and so on. In this post, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a look at a few interesting new language features. \n\nFollow PSR-0/PSR-4 standards on namespace roots\nFollowing PSR-0/PSR-4 coding standards is easy with PhpStorm. It brings Source &amp; Test directories for PHP with matching for project structure and namespaces (as in PSR-0); can detect PSR-0 structure on new project, or maintain structure on new class creation and refactorings; and provides many related inspections.\n\nAdvanced AngularJS support\nUse PhpStorm 8Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced support for the popular AngularJS framework to facilitate your development process with AngularJS.\nEnjoy intelligent code completion for directives, controller and application names, and code insights for data bindings inside of curly-brace expressions. Project template, AngularJS-specific navigation and documentation for directives right from the editor are also in place.\n\nSpy-js, a JavaScript and Node.js tracing tool\nWith spy-js you can see the full list of events that triggered code execution, then dig into the stack trace for an event and explore the highlighted trace in the source code. Spy-js works for websites opened in any browsers on your machine or mobile device, as well as for server-side JavaScript code.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7a39685dd2e5b12f945ca584c1c995a4400fdf","amp;dn":"PhpStorm+8.0.1+%28Mac+OSX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7a39685dd2e5b12f945ca584c1c995a4400fdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,122,57,104,93,210,229,177,47,148,92,165,132,193,201,149,164,64,15,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
