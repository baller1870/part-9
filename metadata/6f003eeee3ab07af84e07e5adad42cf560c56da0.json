The designs, illustrations, and photos demonstrate how to adjust patterns to different styles so that any knitter can customize sweater patterns into unique creations. Challenging projectsÃ‚â€”ranging from sweaters and vests to pullovers and jacketsÃ‚â€”and easy-to-follow instructions illustrate the basic elements of sweater design to inspire knitters at all levels. Learning how to fit the bodice; change yarns, proportions, neckline styles, sleeve length, and color and stitch patterns; and add collars and edgings will give knitters the confidence to alter any pattern to meet their needs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f003eeee3ab07af84e07e5adad42cf560c56da0","amp;dn":"Twisted+Sisters+Knit+Sweaters%3A+A+Knit+to+Fit+Workshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f003eeee3ab07af84e07e5adad42cf560c56da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,0,62,238,227,171,7,175,132,224,126,90,218,212,44,245,96,197,109,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
