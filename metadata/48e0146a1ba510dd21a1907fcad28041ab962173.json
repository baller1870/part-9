Thank You! Audiochecker log included for these rips that are not mine. Other than for Light Chasers, I don't think there is any actual catalog numbers for any albums as this is Craig Minowa's band &amp; label so I'm guessing he didn't bother with catalog numbers. This is quite the bizarre Indie band, especially considering Craig &amp; his wife lost their son in 2002 to SIDS so the emotion and raw power of losing someone so close is very apparent. If anybody has anymore Cloud Cult that could be upped in lossless please do make available! Thanks.\n\n\nKit \n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n\nCloud Cult is an experimental indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota led by singer/songwriter Craig Minowa. The name originated from the ancient prophecies of indigenous North Americans.\n\nCloud Cult developed in 1995 as Craig Minowa recruited several other artists to contribute to his solo recordings. The band's early work earned Cloud Cult several offers from record labels, but all were rejected in favor of self-publishing.[2] As they began to play live, one of their show's most distinctive features was the live painting by Connie Minowa and Scott West: over the course of a show they each completed a painting to be auctioned off at the end.[3]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e0146a1ba510dd21a1907fcad28041ab962173","amp;dn":"Cloud+Cult+-+5+Albums+2004+-+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e0146a1ba510dd21a1907fcad28041ab962173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,224,20,106,27,165,16,221,33,161,144,127,202,210,128,65,171,150,33,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
