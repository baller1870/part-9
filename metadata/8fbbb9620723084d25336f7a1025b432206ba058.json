It was released as the band's seventh single, and the first from the Use Your Illusion albums, in June 1991. Backed with &quot;Civil War&quot; from Use Your Illusion II, the single reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart. \n\nSchwarzenegger appears in the music-video as the T-800 Terminator from the film who arrives at a Guns N' Roses concert, having mission orders to assassinate Axl. When the song is finished, the Terminator confronts the band and individually assesses each member. He gets to Axl and assesses that killing him would be &quot;a waste of ammo.&quot; He then stares at Axl Rose for a while and walks off. Izzy Stradlin was conspicuously absent from the end section of the video. Edited by Jeffrey Abelson, it was one of the most requested music videos during that period, and contributed to the hype surrounding Terminator 2. At the end of 1991, MTV placed it at #1 on their top 100 videos for that year. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Could_Be_Mine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Could_Be_Mine&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9396kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:06:15\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
