This is occasionally awkward since compounds\nwith the same biological activity but significantly different structures are\nrelegated to different chapters, a circumstance particularly evident with\nestrogen antagonists that appear in three different chapters. The cross\nindex found at the end of the book, it is hoped, partly overcomes this\nproblem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e13cef56a99b7f7d556a3a6c676ee5695d7e1b4a","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+of+Drug+Synthesis%2C+Vol+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e13cef56a99b7f7d556a3a6c676ee5695d7e1b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,60,239,86,169,155,127,125,85,106,58,108,103,110,229,105,93,126,27,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
