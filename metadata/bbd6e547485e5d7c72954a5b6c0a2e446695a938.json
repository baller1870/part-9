As the successor to 1975's Made in the Shade, it covers material from 1974's It's Only Rock 'n Roll to 1980's Emotional Rescue sessions.\nContents\n\nAll tracks on Sucking in the Seventies except &quot;Shattered&quot; and &quot;Everything Is Turning to Gold&quot; were mixed or edited for this release. &quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot; is presented in an otherwise unreleased live version, recorded in Detroit on the 1978 tour.\n\n&quot;If I Was A Dancer (Dance Pt. 2)&quot; is a longer and different mix and containing different lyrics from &quot;Dance (Pt. 1)&quot;, the opening track on Emotional Rescue. The Rolling Stones' only #1 hit of this period, &quot;Miss You&quot;, is not included on this compilation.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nReleased in the spring of 1981, as Tattoo You was nearing its completion, Sucking in the Seventies reached #15 in the U.S., going gold, but failed to chart in the UK.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes:\n\n    The amazing thing is that Sucking in the Seventies captures the garish decadence and ennui of the band better than the proper albums from this period. Not that this is a better record than Some Girls, but it is better than either Black and Blue or Emotional Rescue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbd6e547485e5d7c72954a5b6c0a2e446695a938","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+The+-+Sucking+In+The+Seventies%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVilla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbd6e547485e5d7c72954a5b6c0a2e446695a938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,214,229,71,72,94,93,124,114,149,74,91,108,10,46,68,102,149,169,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
