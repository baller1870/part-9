But that's all in a day's work in Rockstar Games' ambitious PS2 sequel, Grand Theft Auto III. Developed by DMA Design, GTA3 is the first installment of the series to utilize a fully three-dimensional living city with open environments and non-linear gameplay. Additional features include a cast of hundreds of different characters, more than 50 types of vehicles, three hours of professionally recorded music, and a huge array of deadly street weapons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a534fe3e4db3982fbbb2405a5540d23507de991b","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+III+%28PS2%29+%28PAL%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a534fe3e4db3982fbbb2405a5540d23507de991b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,52,254,62,77,179,152,47,187,178,64,90,85,64,210,53,7,222,153,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
