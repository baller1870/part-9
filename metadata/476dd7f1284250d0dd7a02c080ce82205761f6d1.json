Ford had originally assembled this lineup to record his 1979 solo album The Inside Story which was released under the name of Robben Ford. During this initial period the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound combined elements of blues, jazz fusion, and progressive rock with Ford contributing vocals. Over the next year the group began moving in a more democratic direction, eliminating FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals and embracing a more commercially oriented jazz-funk approach overall and the band signed with Warner Bros. as Yellowjackets.\n\nContemporary jazz ensemble Yellowjackets' 2011 Mack Avenue debut, Timeline features the band's longstanding knack for straddling the line between smooth jazz and more cerebral post-bop stuff. Marking the group's 30 years in the business, the album is a perfect mix of low-key, soulful moments and more funky, angular jazz. In that sense, it's a perfect balance of what the band has done throughout its career. Showcased here are members saxophonist Bob Mintzer, keyboardist Russell Ferrante, bassist Jimmy Haslip, and drummer Will Kennedy, as well as guests guitarist Robben Ford and trumpeter John Daversa. Ultimately, with tracks like the disarmingly knotty opener &quot;Why Is It,&quot; the expansive &quot;Tenacity,&quot; and the ruminative R&amp;B-infused title track, Timeline reveals Yellowjackets as a band in a seemingly reinvigorated and creative state of mind. Not a bad place to be at 30. \n\nThe 2008 album &quot;Lifecycle&quot; was uploaded by cloudBase (thank you) and can be found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6685903/Yellowjackets_-_Lifecycle_%282008%29_%5BFLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6685903/Yellowjackets_-_Lifecycle_%282008%29_%5BFLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:476dd7f1284250d0dd7a02c080ce82205761f6d1","amp;dn":"Yellowjackets+-+Timeline+%282011%29+EAC-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"476dd7f1284250d0dd7a02c080ce82205761f6d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,109,215,241,40,66,80,208,221,122,2,192,128,206,130,32,87,97,246,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
