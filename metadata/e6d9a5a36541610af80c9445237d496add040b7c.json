The most commercially successful and long-lasting line-up includes keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. Other important members were singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career, from folk music to progressive rock in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 130 million.\r\n\r\nWork on the twelfth Genesis album, Genesis, began in March 1983. It is the first album written, recorded, and mixed at the remodelled studio at The Farm.  &quot;Mama&quot; concerns a man's obsession with a prostitute at a Cuban brothel. It originated from a beat Rutherford came up with on a LinnDrum machine that was fed through his guitar amplifier and an echo gate. Collins's laugh on the track originated from &quot;The Message&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. \r\n\r\nReleased in October 1983, Genesis went to No. 1 in the UK and peaked at No. 9 in the US, where it reached Platinum by December that year and went on to sell over four million copies. Three tracks were released as singles; &quot;Mama&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK, their highest charting UK single to date, and &quot;That's All&quot; reached No. 6 in the U.S. The Mama Tour ran from late 1983 through to 1984, covering North America and five UK shows in Birmingham. The latter shows were filmed and released as Genesis Live â€“ The Mama Tour.\r\n\r\nTracklist Genesis\r\n\r\n(01) [Genesis] Mama.mp3\r\n(02) [Genesis] That's All.mp3\r\n(03) [Genesis] Home By The Sea.mp3\r\n(04) [Genesis] Second Home By The Sea.mp3\r\n(05) [Genesis] Illegal Alien.mp3\r\n(06) [Genesis] Takin' It All Too Hard.mp3\r\n(07) [Genesis] Just A Job To Do.mp3\r\n(08) [Genesis] Silver Rainbow.mp3\r\n(09) [Genesis] It's Gonna Get Better.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\nTony Banks\r\n\r\n    Active: 1967â€“1998, 1999, 2000, 2006â€“present\r\n    Instruments: keyboards, backing vocals, guitar\r\n    Release contributions: all releases.\r\n\r\nMike Rutherford\r\n\r\n    Active: 1967â€“1998, 1999, 2000, 2006â€“present\r\n    Instruments: bass, guitars, backing vocals, bass pedals, twelve-string guitar, cello, electric sitar\r\n    Release contributions: all releases.\r\n\r\nPhil Collins\r\n\r\n    Active: 1970â€“1996, 1999, 2000, 2006â€“present\r\n    Instruments: drums, percussion, lead vocals, backing vocals, vibraphone, drum machine, Simmons drums\r\n    Release contributions: all releases from Nursery Cryme to The Way We Walk, Volume Two: The Longs and Live over Europe 2007","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6d9a5a36541610af80c9445237d496add040b7c","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+Genesis+1983+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6d9a5a36541610af80c9445237d496add040b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,217,165,163,101,65,97,10,248,12,148,69,35,125,73,106,221,4,11,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
