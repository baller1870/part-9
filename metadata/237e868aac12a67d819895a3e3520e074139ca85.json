It is an impassioned protest against persecution and tyranny with an overriding message of peace. Renowned British baritone and composer Roderick Williams takes a look at the story behind A Child of Our Time and introduces conductor Mark Wigglesworth, the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales and soloists Tamara Wilson (soprano), Susan Bickley (mezzo-soprano), Peter Hoare (tenor) and James Creswell (bass).\r\n\r\nIn 1938, a young Polish Jew, whose parents were deported by the Nazis, shot a German diplomat in Paris. The Nazis seized on the assassination to rile Hitler's supporters into an anti-Semitic frenzy. Tippett shared the public horror at the events that followed and in 1939, began writing a musical protest, a work that expressed deep rage at the unprecedented crimes being committed by the Nazi regime, and despair at man's ability to commit acts of inhumanity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237e868aac12a67d819895a3e3520e074139ca85","amp;dn":"BBC.Proms.2016.07.24.A.Child.of.Our.Time.EN.SUB.HEVC.x265.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237e868aac12a67d819895a3e3520e074139ca85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,126,134,138,172,18,166,125,129,152,149,163,227,82,14,7,65,57,202,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
