While his neighborhood friends all settle down into their various chosen professions, Augie, as particular as an aristocrat, demands a special destiny. He latches on to a wild succession of occupations, proudly rejecting each one as too limiting. It is not until he tangles with a glamorous perfectionist named Thea, a huntress with a trained eagle, that his independence is seriously threatened. Luckily, his nature, like the eagle's, breaks down under the strain. He goes on to recruit himself to even more outlandish projects, but always ducks out in time to continue improvising his unconventional career. \n\nWith a jaunty sense of humor embedded in a serious moral view, Bellow's story both celebrates and satirizes the irrepressible American spirit.\n\nRead by Tom Parker \nFormat: WMA \n\nMP3 CD: 2 pages\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; Unabridged edition (January 1, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0786186593\nISBN-13: 978-0786186594\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
