An unknown individual stole[4] and anonymously disseminated over a thousand e-mails and other documents.[5][6][7] The university confirmed that a &quot;criminal breach&quot; of their security systems took place,[8] but could not confirm the authenticity of the material at short notice,[9] and expressed concern &quot;that personal information about individuals may have been compromised.&quot;[10] Details of the incident have been reported to the police, who are investigating.[5] Later, Phil Jones, Director of the CRU, confirmed that all of the leaked emails that had provoked heated debate appeared to be genuine.[11]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fcf030648ee95d6f24fc2b76afcbf62edcd0ba5","amp;dn":"Climategate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fcf030648ee95d6f24fc2b76afcbf62edcd0ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,207,3,6,72,238,149,214,242,79,194,183,106,252,191,98,237,205,11,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
