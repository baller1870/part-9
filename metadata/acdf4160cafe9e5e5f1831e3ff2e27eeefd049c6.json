Alfred Hitchcock is a fascinating look at the life of one of the most influential filmmakers in the world -- a man known for his portly profile and distinct, leery voice almost as much as for his groundbreaking movies.\n\nFrom Hitchcock's first film, Blackmail -- the first British movie with sound -- to his blockbuster Hollywood successes, Psycho, The Birds, Rear Window, and Vertigo, Alfred Hitchcock chronicles the Master of Suspense's close working relationship with his wife, Alma, who was an integral part of his filmmaking process, and the struggle to gain full artistic control over his work. With illustrations throughout and sidebars showcasing Hitchcocks techniques and directing style, Alfred Hitchcock reveals how some of the greatest films ever created came to be through the life and work of one of the most admired filmmakers ever.\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdf4160cafe9e5e5f1831e3ff2e27eeefd049c6","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+Filming+Our+Fears+%5BPDF%5D+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdf4160cafe9e5e5f1831e3ff2e27eeefd049c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,223,65,96,202,254,158,94,95,24,49,227,255,46,39,238,239,208,73,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
