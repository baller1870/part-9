[promo].VOB\n\n\nHQ very rare promo music video from a promo DVD. &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; is a single from the soundtrack of the same name by Wang Chung. Released in September 1985, the song rose on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #41.\n\nOn the To Live and Die in L.A. DVD audio commentary, director William Friedkin stated to Wang Chung that he Ã¢â‚¬Å“didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a theme song for To Live and Die in L.A.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ One day, though, Jack Hues &amp; Nick Feldman gave Friedkin a copy of &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (to his dismay). Surprisingly, Friedkin was impressed and decided to keep the song as part of the movie and the soundtrack.\n\nThe To Live and Die in L.A. soundtrack is Wang Chung's third album and second on Geffen Records. Instead of following up on the success that Points on the Curve landed them, the band switched gears to produce an original motion picture soundtrack. The switch allowed for them to experiment with different styles of music from the conventional pop music on their previous album. Released in 1985, only the album's title song made it on the US Billboard Hot 100 where it peaked at #41.\n\nWang Chung are an English new wave musical group formed in 1980. The name Wang Chung means &quot;yellow bell&quot; in Chinese, and is the first note in the Chinese classical music scale.\n\nThe group found their greatest success in the United States, with five Top 40 hits in the US, all charting between 1983 and 1987, including &quot;Dance Hall Days&quot; (No. 16 in the summer of 1984), &quot;Everybody Have Fun Tonight&quot; (No. 2 in 1986) and &quot;Let's Go!&quot; (No. 9 in 1987).\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Live_and_Die_in_L.A._(Wang_Chung_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Live_and_Die_in_L.A._(Wang_Chung_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAPJmaaFl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MAPJmaaFl&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:58\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
