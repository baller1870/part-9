That was the only explanation that she could come up with. Why else would she feel this way for the biggest SOB in town? Granted, he was also the hottest man in town, but he was also arrogant, callous, and determined to drive her away even as he drove her crazy with his touch. She should just walk away from him and probably would if it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t for this connection that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d always had with him that kept making her want more with the one man that couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give her anything more than heartache.\n\nHe should have left and never looked back when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d decided to finally do the right thing and push Marty out of his life, but instead he stuck around to torture himself by staying close to the one woman that he could never allow himself to have. She deserved better than him, better than the tortured existence that he led and better than the horrifying future that waited for him.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403f18106cd2776a9dee1d08641aad0f71c3a008","amp;dn":"Black+Heart+%28Cursed+Hearts+%231%29+by+R.L.+Mathewson+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403f18106cd2776a9dee1d08641aad0f71c3a008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,63,24,16,108,210,119,106,157,238,29,8,100,26,173,15,113,195,160,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
