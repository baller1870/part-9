I'm really glad I did because I love listening to this CD along with Vegas. However, I could probably live without track 5 because it's basically the same beat over and over without much change but it's still fun to listen to. TCM plays really fast techno/rock kind of music and is great to dance to and just get into the beat. I mainly got interested in TCM after hearing Keep Hope Alive, More, Now Is The Time(olympic mix) and Busy Child from the fifa 98 soundtrack, so I knew that I had to get Vegas. If you love techno than buy this CD and Vegas. TCM ROCKS!!!!  \n\n\n\n320 bit rate MP3\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n1    &quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot; (There Is Hope Mix)\n2    &quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot; (Trip Hope Mix)\n3    &quot;More '99 Mix&quot;\n4    &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (The Olympic Mix) (Live)\n5    &quot;Now Is the Time&quot; (Secret Knowledge Overkill Mix)\n6    &quot;The Dubeliscious Groove&quot; (Fly Spanish Version)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fa2ec4d34a90fe74fb907287e9279a4dd99e7d6","amp;dn":"The+Crystal+Method+-+Keep+Hope+Alive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fa2ec4d34a90fe74fb907287e9279a4dd99e7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,162,236,77,52,169,15,231,79,185,7,40,126,146,121,164,221,153,231,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
