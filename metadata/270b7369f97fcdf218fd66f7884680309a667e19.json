The film has a cast of characters that will become \nfamily by the film\\'s end. Louise (Georgia Zaris), friend to a gaggle of gay men,\n just wants to make sure that her current beau Paul (Jeremy Edwards) is actually straight. \nShe has a history of dating gay men, so she brings him to a dinner party with\n her buddies. There\\'s Alex (Luke de Woolfson), a cater-waiter whose acting career \nis always just about to take off. He\\'s living with Harry (James Lance), a reality \nTV producer who\\'s ashamed of the crap he foists on the public. Tom (David Morris) \nis a successful artist who brings his rental boyfriend Larrs to the party; \nLarrs (Benjamin Hart) is always on the make, or is he? And then there\\'s William \n(Rocky Marshall), whose 11-year-old daughter is determined to drive her dad\\'s \nboyfriends away. Current beau Lawrence (Leon Ockenden) is a TV star who everyone \nsort of recognizes, and who thinks that he\\'s actually the doctor he plays on TV. \nDirector/co-writer Jacqui Morris and her co-writer brother David have crafted a \nfast-paced movie about a group of charming characters who each discover an inner \ntruth as the film develops. The frothy, fun and upbeat Mr. Right is one of the \nbest date movies this year.
