The low-impact, flowing movements sharpen the mind and strengthen the body, reducing stress and increasing flexibility. Regular practice can help lower blood pressure, relieve chronic pain, and improve sleep. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re an athlete, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find that Tai Chi improves your focus and endurance.\n\nBut to get the most out of a Tai Chi practice, expert instruction from the start is key. So is the ability to repeat sections over and over until they are second nature. International martial arts champion Tiffany Chen learned this 60-movement Yang-form practice from her father, Grandmaster William C.C. Chen. Her expertise and the unique features of this DVD make it ideal for beginners or others wanting to improve their practice.\n\nVideo; x264; 716*576 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f2fae74f114e4a54993fef855cc9653c8c09856","amp;dn":"Step-by-Step+Tai+Chi+with+Tiffany+Chen+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f2fae74f114e4a54993fef855cc9653c8c09856","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,47,174,116,241,20,228,165,73,147,254,248,85,204,150,83,200,192,152,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
