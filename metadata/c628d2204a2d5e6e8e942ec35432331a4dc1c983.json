Politicians and journalists appeal to political correctness, humanitarian values, feminism, multiculturalism, queer theories etc to transform former healthy countries closer to totalitarian societies, where only politically correct opinions are accepted. Dissident opinions are labeled as hatred,\nracism, facism, nazism, islamophobic, homophobic etc, which successfully puts an end to all debates in the media. This is threatening the democratic system and the freedom of speech.\n\nHowever, it's not easy to understand where political correctness comes from or how it's all connected: politics, mass media, immigration, feminism and socialism. This collection of ebooks won't give you a complete picture of the modern western society and its PC sickness, but will aid you in connecting the dots and hopefully make you develop your critical thinking. Everything's not always what it seem in the news\n(sometimes quite the contrary), and critical thinking is essential to be able to make your own decisions about your future and the future of your country.\n\nThe first eBook collection focused mostly on intelligence and genetics. In this torrent I've included some books which covers the roots from marxism to PC, how PC is harming the modern society and how media is changing our way of thinking by changing the language and by applying it's own PC-terminology and values.\n\nThe books are in PDF or ePub format.\n\n\nI strongly recommend the norweigian tv-series &quot;Hjernevask&quot; (Brainwash) which investigates the subjects\nmentioned below. Several authors of the included ebooks are interviewed in Hjernevask, and the books can be\neasier to understand after watching the show.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6731035/Brainwash_-_Hjernevask&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6731035/Brainwash_-_Hjernevask&lt;/a&gt; (English subtitles)\n\nSubjects:\n\nIntelligence, IQ, Political Correctness, Cultural Marxism, Genetics, Socialism, Freedom, Liberty, Social Class,\nCritical Thinking, Culture, Race, Multiculturalism, Inequality, Human Nature, Gender, Science, Psychology, Mass media,\nIslam \n\n\neBooks included:\n\n(Archives of Sexual Behavior) Bruce Rind-The Bailey Affair_ Political Correctness and Attacks on Sex Research (2008) (Article)\nCharles Murray-Coming Apart_ The State of White America, 1960-2010-Crown Forum (2013)\nCharles Murray-Income Inequality and IQ-AEI Press (1998)\nKarl-Olov Arnstberg, Gunnar Sandelin-Invandring och mÃƒÂ¶rklÃƒÂ¤ggning - En saklig rapport frÃƒÂ¥n en fÃƒÂ¶rryckt tid-DebattfÃƒÂ¶rlaget, Trolltekst (2013)\nLincoln Dahlberg, Sean Phelan-Discourse Theory and Critical Media Politics (2011)\nMichael Specter-Denialism - How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives (2009)\nPatrick J.
