His most precious possession is the set of knives he uses, and when one of them (his favorite Bowie) is stolen along a deserted stretch of highway, Cain will stop at nothing to get it back.\n\nUnfortunately for Hunter, the thief is his brother, a man who has been on the run from his own mis-takes but is now in the crosshairs of a seriously deranged man. To find his brother, Hunter must find Cain, and the chase takes all three men on a hair-raising journey across the country to a barren spot in the American Southwest, where bones have become.....\n\n\nMore Info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=437#pid437&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=107&amp;pid=437#pid437&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a5aca39fddd32a87bae4951ceee3b9d82c7df95","amp;dn":"Joe+Hunter+%5B%231-8%5D%5B2009-13%5D%5BMatt+Hilton%5D%5Bmobi%2Fepub%5D%5BINFERNO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a5aca39fddd32a87bae4951ceee3b9d82c7df95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,90,202,57,253,221,50,168,123,174,73,81,206,238,59,157,130,199,223,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
