However, information is currently divided amongst traditional physics, chemistry and materials science books. This book collates previously disparate literature into one comprehensive and practical source, providing a thorough understanding of the information contained in crystallographic data files and the application of x-ray diffraction methods. The book has been written for final year and postgraduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247f6a381c00dafb06b1a5b6d9bc57bdcf2fbb90","amp;dn":"Crystallography+-+Dieter+Schwanzerbach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247f6a381c00dafb06b1a5b6d9bc57bdcf2fbb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,127,106,56,28,0,218,251,6,177,165,182,217,188,87,189,207,47,187,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
