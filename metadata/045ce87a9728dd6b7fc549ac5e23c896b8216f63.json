The fourth release under the Experience Hendrix deal with Legacy Recordings, it contains twelve previously unreleased recordings of tracks he was working on for the planned follow-up to Electric Ladyland. It was released on March 5th, 2013.\n\nThe tracks featured on People, Hell &amp; Angels are previously unreleased recordings of songs that Jimi Hendrix and fellow band members (mainly the Band of Gypsys lineup featuring Billy Cox and Buddy Miles) were working on as the follow-up to Electric Ladyland, tentatively titled First Rays of the New Rising Sun. The majority of the recordings are drawn from sessions in 1968 and '69 at the Record Plant Studios in New York, with a few inclusions from Hendrix's brief residencies at Sound Centre, the Hit Factory, and his own Electric Lady Studios. \n\nAccording to Eddie Kramer. the engineer who recorded most of Hendrix's music during his lifetime, this will be the last Hendrix album to feature unreleased studio material. Kramer said that several as-yet-unreleased live recordings would be available in the coming years.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll songs written and composed by Jimi Hendrix, except &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; by Elmore James and &quot;Mojo Man&quot; by Albert Allen and Arthur Allen. \n\n01. \t&quot;Earth Blues&quot;   \t3:33\n02. \t&quot;Somewhere&quot;   \t4:05\n03. \t&quot;Hear My Train a Comin'&quot;   \t5:41\n04. \t&quot;Bleeding Heart&quot;   \t3:58\n05. \t&quot;Let Me Move You&quot;   \t6:50\n06. \t&quot;Izabella&quot;   \t3:42\n07. \t&quot;Easy Blues&quot;   \t5:57\n08. \t&quot;Crash Landing&quot;   \t4:14\n09. \t&quot;Inside Out&quot;   \t5:03\n10. \t&quot;Hey Gypsy Boy&quot;   \t3:39\n11. \t&quot;Mojo Man&quot;   \t4:07\n12. \t&quot;Villanova Junction Blues&quot;   \t1:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045ce87a9728dd6b7fc549ac5e23c896b8216f63","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+People%2C+Hell+And+Angels+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045ce87a9728dd6b7fc549ac5e23c896b8216f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,92,232,122,151,40,221,107,127,197,73,172,94,35,200,150,184,33,111,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
