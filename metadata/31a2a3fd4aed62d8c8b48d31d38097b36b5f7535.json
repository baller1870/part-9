At age 13, he lost his father.\n\nDionysiou went to work as a tailor and was married, at age 20, to Georgia Laveni. The couple would have four children. While still working as a tailor, he also appeared in night clubs in Thessaloniki where he had moved.\n\nDionysiou left Thessaloniki for Athens to further his singing career. He appeared in Nikaia night club &quot;Asteras&quot; with well-established singer Kaity Grey and in 1959 recorded his first song. The 24-year old singer was signed by recording company &quot;Columbia&quot; and started singing songs by Babis Bakalis, Kostas Virvos and others with some success. He next re-recorded older songs by laika masters such as Vasilis Tsitsanis, Yiannis Papaioannou, Giorgos Mitsakis and Manolis Chiotis.\nHe died on May 11, 1990 at age 54.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
