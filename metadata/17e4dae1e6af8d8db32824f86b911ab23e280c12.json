Better yet, read on. This tale of adventure and discovery describes the beginning of Brian Tracy's personal journey to success and wealth. It began when he awoke one day with an exciting dreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to travel from the west coast of America to Cape Town, South Africa. That trip led to an unexpected and dangerous confrontation with reality deep in the heart of the Sahara Desert. He would never be the same again, having learned the critical importance of courage, persistence, and the acceptance of total responsibility for one's very survival. Using his story as a metaphor for any success in life, Brian Tracy shares how everyone can find similar lessons in their own lives. You learn the simple, yet essential steps you can take right now to achieve the greatness that lies within you. This is not a book of platitudes. It doesn't contain neatly numbered &quot;secrets&quot; of success. This book is about life, real lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and real su! ccess, with all its ups and downs. As you read, reflect on your own journey. You, too, will find success if you faithfully carry on.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e4dae1e6af8d8db32824f86b911ab23e280c12","amp;dn":"Brian+Tracy+-+Success+Is+a+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e4dae1e6af8d8db32824f86b911ab23e280c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,228,218,225,230,175,141,141,179,40,36,248,107,145,26,178,62,40,12,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
