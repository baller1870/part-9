This feature uses the built-in handwriting recognition in Windows 7 and later.\n\n\nPoint-and-Click Editing with Automatic Formatting: Create equations quickly by choosing templates from MathType's palettes and typing into their empty slots. \nMathType applies mathematical spacing rules automatically as you type.\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts: Save time using keyboard shortcuts. MathType has customizable keyboard shortcuts for virtually every symbol, template, and command.\n\n\n\nType TeX or LaTeX: If you already know the TeX typesetting language, you can enter equations directly into MathType or Microsoft Word documents. TeX editing can be mixed with point-and-click editing so you get the best of both worlds. You can even paste in equations from existing TeX documents.\n\n\n\nCopy-and-Paste: If you created your equation in another application or found one on a website, why take the time to create it by hand again? Simply copy-and-paste it directly into MathType, and it is ready to edit or use in your work.\n\n\n\nSave Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used equations and expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can be inserted later with just a click or a keystroke.\n\n\n\nSupports Microsoft Office:\nOffice 2013 and Office 365: MathType 6.9 is fully compatible with Office 2013 and Office 365 installed on Windows 7 and 8 computers.\n\n\nOffice 2010, 2007, 2003, and XP: MathType 6.9 is fully compatible.\n\n\n\nOffice Web Apps, Office Mobile, and Office RT: MathType equations cannot be edited in these Office versions but equations created in other versions of Office will display and print.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Office 2013, 2010,  &amp; 2007 Ã¢â‚¬â€ MathType Ribbon Tab in Word and PowerPoint: MathType takes full advantage of Office's Ribbon User Interface making it easier than ever to do equation operations in documents and presentations.
