Much less than we like to think. All that mystery, all that poetry, all those complex behaviors surÃ‚Â­rounding human bonding leading to the most life-changing decisions weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever make, are unconsciously driven by a few molecules in our brain. How does love begin? How can two strangers come to the conclusion that it would not only be pleasant to share their lives, but that they must share them? How can a man say he loves his wife, yet still cheat on her? Why do others stay in relationships even after the roÃ‚Â­mance fades? How is it possible to fall in love with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“wrongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ person? How do people come to have a Ã¢â‚¬Å“typeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? Physical attraction, jealousy, infidelity, mother-infant bondingÃ¢â‚¬â€all the behaviors that so often leave us befuddledÃ¢â‚¬â€are now being teased out of the fog of mystery thanks to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social neuroscience. Larry Young, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading experts in the field, and journalist Brian Alexander explain how those findings apply to you. Drawing on real human stories and research from labs around the world, The Chemistry Between Us is a bold attempt to create a Ã¢â‚¬Å“grand unified theoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of love. \n\nSome of the mind-blowing insights include:\n\nLove can get such a grip on us because it is, literally, an addiction. To a woman falling in love, a man is like her baby. Why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s false to say society makes gender, and how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to have the body of one gender and the brain of another.\nWhy some people are more likely to cheat than others. Why we sometimes truly canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist temptation.  Young and Alexander place their revelations into historical, political, and social contexts. In the proÃ‚Â­cess, they touch on everything from gay marriage to why single-mother households might not be good for society. The Chemistry Between Us offers powerful inÃ‚Â­sights into love, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and family life that will prove to be enlightening, controÃ‚Â­versial, and thought provoking.\n\n\n\nPaperback: 320 pages\nPublisher: Current; Reprint edition (January 28, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1591846617\nISBN-13: 978-1591846611\n_____________________________\n\nAudiobook:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.mn/torrent/11727603/The_Chemistry_between_Us__Love__Sex_and.._Larry_Young_ABEE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.mn/torrent/11727603/The_Chemistry_between_Us__Love__Sex_and.._Larry_Young_ABEE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_____________________________\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
