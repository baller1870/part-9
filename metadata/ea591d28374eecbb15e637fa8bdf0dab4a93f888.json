Munchkin takes place in a very flexible mashup of genres. Originally a satire of fantasy roleplaying, it has since then taken on non-fantasy and non-gaming elements. Characters in Munchkin change constantly but never permanently. What do Munchkins do? They play for the win. They are rules lawyers. They backstab. They gloat. They whine when someone else backstabs or gloats. Munchkins are emotional. Munchkins may be clever, but they are never wise. Munchkins have short attention spans. Munchkins may be brave in the face of awful odds, but they are even braver when beating up crippled goblins for their lunch money. If a Munchkin seems to show mercy, it's because he was bored or distracted. After all, even stomping an ant helps you level up.&quot;\n\n\nThanks to AnPymGold-Empire for the digital copy; please seed and enjoy. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea591d28374eecbb15e637fa8bdf0dab4a93f888","amp;dn":"Munchkin+001+%282015%29+%28Digital%29+%28AnPymGold-Empire%29+%7BVTS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea591d28374eecbb15e637fa8bdf0dab4a93f888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,89,29,40,55,78,236,187,21,230,55,250,139,223,13,171,74,147,248,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
