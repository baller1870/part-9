It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. \nOk pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. \nSurely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n_______________________________\n\nIf the torrent remains stalled with DHT only, add this trackers (if not just present in the torrent you download):\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.prq.to:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.tracker.prq.to:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n\nFred Frith Discography\n\nA MUSIC torrent :)\n\nDig the eclectic personality of Fred Frith:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Frith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Frith&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWhile building this torrent I felt like a modern art museum curator, being so wide the range of the genres that Frith has explored in his lenghty career:\nprogressive, jazz, experimental, noise, avantgarde.\nI warn you... this is not music for lollipops, not commercial shit to please MTV addicted...\n\nThis is like a Venice Biennal, like a visit at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, like  the chocolate box of Forrest Gump's mama...\nYou never know what you're gonna get... So careful... handle with care :D\n\nA big thanks to the french blogger sinziana, for the huge number of downloads I got from him...\nAnd a big thanks to my TPB mate ill88eagle who joined his crawling skills with mine to build this torrent.\nI guess that this discography will meet his tastes, far more than mine :P\n\nAnyway this is not the complete discography (Wikipedia sources said that the whole bulk of albums where Frith appeared should be around 400 units)...\nWhat you will find here aren't but 115 albums... what was available today after an extensive crawling throughout the web..\n\nI've also appended a txt file with the missing albums I know about... If somebody with good will got some of those missing works, feel free to post a comment on this torrent at TPB (either contact me on SuprBay)...\n\nI don't know if this will be one of my &quot;Saint John in the desert&quot; like torrents. It's up to anybody amongst you to keep it alive. And you can do it if you share my idea that music is a culture that must be available for free to anybody...\n\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot;
