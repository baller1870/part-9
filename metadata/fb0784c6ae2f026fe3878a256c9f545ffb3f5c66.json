It's a good strong shot of vintage bop, but like so many compilations it suffers slightly from chronologic scrambling. That wouldn't even be worth mentioning were it not for the inclusion of a handful of Bird's early pre-bop recordings. The oldest material, which happens to be the earliest known recording of Charlie Parker, shows up on track 24; &quot;Honeysuckle Rose/Body &amp; Soul&quot; was recorded in Kansas City, KS on May 11, 1940. Placing this chestnut more than one-third of the way into an almost chronological collection is incongruous and will not assist anyone who is trying to savor the man's artistic development over a stated span of thirteen years. That, after all, is what chronologies (and historic jazz collections) are for. The next-to-oldest recordings appear closer to where one would expect them to be -- at the very beginning of the collection. &quot;Swingmatism&quot; and the &quot;Hootie Blues&quot; were recorded for the Decca label in Dallas, TX on April 30, 1941 by Jay McShann &amp; His Orchestra. Something like a chronological progression does manage to materialize, more or less, and when Bird isn't leading his own groups he is heard sitting in with bands led by Red Norvo, Slim Gaillard, and Dizzy Gillespie. While it's very nice to know that these great recordings continue to circulate, it's a damned shame they didn't place the titles in chronological sequence, for Charlie Parker's progress occurred swiftly and very dramatically and there's nothing quite like hearing him evolve, session by session and note by note. \n\n\n\nTrack Listing - Disc 2\n\t\n1   Donna Lee  Miles Davis / Charlie Parker  2:36 \t\n2   Milestones  Miles Davis\t2:37 \t\n3   Little Willie Leaps  Miles Davis\t2:51 \t\n4   The Hymn  Charlie Parker\t2:30 \t\n5   Scrapple from the Apple  Charlie Parker  3:02 \t\n6   My Old Flame  Sam Coslow / Arthur Johnston\t3:15 \t\n7   Don't Blame Me    Dorothy Fields / Jimmy McHugh  2:50 \t\n8   Bongo Beep  Charlie Parker  3:08 \t\n9   How Deep Is the Ocean  Irving Berlin  3:33 \t\n10  Bird Gets the Worm  Charlie Parker\t2:42 \t\n11  Barbados  Charlie Parker\t2:29 \t\n12  Ah-Leu-Cha  Charlie Parker\t2:57 \t\t\n13  Parker's Mood  Charlie Parker  3:05 \t\t\n14  Perhaps  Charlie Parker  2:34 \t\t\n15  Marmaduke  Charlie Parker  2:45 \t\n16  Visa  Charlie Parker  3:03 \t\n17  April in Paris  Vernon Duke / E.Y. &quot;Yip&quot; Harburg  3:09 \t\n18  Bloomdido  Charlie Parker  3:27 \t\t\n19  Leap Frog  Charlie Parker  2:33 \t\n20  Out of Nowhere  Johnny Green / Edward Heyman  3:12 \t\n21  Au Privave  Charlie Parker\t2:49 \t\n22  Star Eyes  Gene DePaul / Don Raye\t3:37 \t\n23  My Little Suede Shoes  Charlie Parker  3:07 \t\n24  Lover Man  Roger &quot;Ram&quot; Ramirez / Jimmy Sherman  3:24 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0784c6ae2f026fe3878a256c9f545ffb3f5c66","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Retrospective+%281940-53%29+vol.+2+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0784c6ae2f026fe3878a256c9f545ffb3f5c66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,7,132,198,174,47,2,111,227,135,138,37,108,159,84,95,251,63,92,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
