His idea of living his own life, though, is to take up residence in the city's sewers. His dutiful servant, who happens to be a thief, accompanies him. Appeals to his rich uncle to do something about it fall on deaf ears -- the uncle, who prefers the company of his Dalmatians to that of people, is as nutty as he is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bfafc9c437e33d327365ae96348725810ad1cfa","amp;dn":"The+Rainbow+Thief%2C+Alejandro+Jodorwsky%2C+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bfafc9c437e33d327365ae96348725810ad1cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,250,252,156,67,126,51,211,39,54,90,233,99,72,114,88,16,173,28,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
