Schatz, &quot;Healthcare Infrastructure: Health Systems for Individuals and Populations (Health Informatics)&quot;\n Publisher: S***ger | 2011 | ISBN: 0857294512 | PDF | 305 pages | 4.5 MB\n\n The first systematic survey of Healthcare Infrastructure, this book describes the inevitable future of health systems. It gives a concrete plan for improved quality at diminished cost, via merger of personal medicine and public health. It discusses general aspects of infrastructure engineering and specific aspects of healthcare systems. It discusses current and future technologies for health measurement and management. This book outlines how the health of populations will be measured at the level of individuals, combining engineering and medicine to support viable health systems for the first time. This book is unique, in combining a systematic survey of health determinants with a research monograph on health technologies. Readers will gain a broad context and a deep knowledge of future information technology applied to health systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8083f71d650a9215df4e6deced5e63d40d9b71d6","amp;dn":"Healthcare+Infrastructure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8083f71d650a9215df4e6deced5e63d40d9b71d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,131,247,29,101,10,146,21,223,78,109,236,237,94,99,212,13,155,113,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
