This is a 1992 CD recorded DDD. It is an interesting compilation to say the least. &quot;Modern&quot; musicians spinning out roaring 20's music and other greats and they do a great job of making that era come to life. What Big Papi finds uber-cool is the record label. It is released on &quot;Angel&quot; records which was huge back in the day for producing vinyl records of classical music. The label is still alive and well it appears. Have not researched it but Big Papi would have bet that label died 50 years ago.\n\nPlease search Big Papi Jazz to add more music to your collection.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n\n\n[quote]By Danielle Bennignus\n\n.....Rob Fisher and his Coffee Club Orchestra have caught the sound of the 1920's and 1930's, and most generously share it with us. The band members are marvelous, period instruments are incorporated, and the selected tunes are all gems. Oh, and Garrison Keillor treats us to his unique vocal talents in three of the pieces. What more could one ask for?....[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/OQD7YReyxn.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nRob Fisher/Coffee Club Orchestra - Shaking the Blues Away: Good Tunes for Hard Times\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Rob Fisher/Coffee Club Orchestra\nAlbum................: Shaking the Blues Away: Good Tunes for Hard Times\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1992\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 249kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
