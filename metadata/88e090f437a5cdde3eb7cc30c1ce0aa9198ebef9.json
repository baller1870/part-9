When asking a question on forums or chat rooms, many CakePHP beginners get little help from the experts. Simple questions can get a response like, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWell, just read the online manual and API.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Unfortunately, the online manual is depreciated, and who wants to absorb a programming language or framework from an API? Beginning CakePHP will do the following:\n# Leads you from a basic setup of CakePHP to building a couple applications that will highlight CakePHPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s functionality and capabilities without delving too deeply into the PHP language, but rather what the CakePHP framework can offer the developer.\n# Teaches you to use CakePHP by incorporating advanced features into your web development projects.\n# Targets beginners of CakePHP or web frameworks in general as well as experienced developers with limited exposure to CakePHP. A secondary audience may include developers undecided on adopting CakePHP or business managers trying to assess the value of incorporating CakePHP into their toolbox.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\n    * Install and configure the CakePHP web framework.\n    * Create your first CakePHP web application: toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“do lists.\n    * Progress by building a more complex blogging application.\n    * Incorporate Ajax and Web 2.0 principles and techniques into your blogging and other CakePHP applications.\n    * Apply these sample applications along with advanced techniques as a framework or template for building your own web applications with CakePHP going forward.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e090f437a5cdde3eb7cc30c1ce0aa9198ebef9","amp;dn":"Apress.Beginning.CakePHP.From.Novice.to.Professional.Jun.2008.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e090f437a5cdde3eb7cc30c1ce0aa9198ebef9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,224,144,244,55,165,205,222,62,183,204,48,193,206,10,169,25,142,190,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
