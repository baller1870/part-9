FranÃƒÂ§ois is 20, a poet, dodging military service. He takes to the barricades, but won't throw a Molotov cocktail at the police. He smokes opium and talks about revolution with his friend, Antoine, who has an inheritance and a flat where FranÃƒÂ§ois can stay. FranÃƒÂ§ois meets Lilie, a sculptor who works at a foundry to support herself. They fall in love. A year passes; FranÃƒÂ§ois continues to write, talk, smoke, and be with Lilie. Opportunities come to Lilie: what will she and FranÃƒÂ§ois do?\n\n\n[ Just portuguese subtitles ]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062c766ffe6522767f7e246ed88af50bd2c7ae88","amp;dn":"Les+Amants+R%26eacute%3Bguliers+%282005%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062c766ffe6522767f7e246ed88af50bd2c7ae88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,44,118,111,254,101,34,118,127,126,36,110,216,138,245,11,210,199,174,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
