Monitor problems plagued some of their acoustic \r\nset. Also, Page broke a string during Bron-Y-Aur Stomp and Jones \r\nfilled in with jazz improvisation (Plant: &quot;At least we know we can play \r\nin the hotel bar afterwards&quot;). Stairway To Heaven has the most beautiful \r\nPage solo ever performed, and the show as a whole is strong and full of \r\nenergy, even though it may not be the most technically perfect one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272e71583a18c997995d1a5f516f9e99926a0084","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.07.17+Seattle%2C+Washington+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272e71583a18c997995d1a5f516f9e99926a0084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,46,113,88,58,24,201,151,153,93,26,95,81,111,158,153,146,106,0,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
