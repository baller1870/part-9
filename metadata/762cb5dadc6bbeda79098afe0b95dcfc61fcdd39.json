In the nude! Parents be warned! Most of the words in this book were written by a naked man!\n\nSo. You want to argue with that? All right, we give in.\n\nStarship Titanic is the greatest, most fabulous, most technologically advanced interstellar cruise line ever built. It is like a cross between the Queen Mary, the Chrysler Building, Tutankhamen's tomb, and Venice. Furthermore, it cannot possibly go wrong. . . .\n\nSadly, however, seconds after its launch it undergoes SMEF, or Spontaneous Massive Existence Failure. And disappears. \n\nExcept, everything's got to be somewhere. \n\nComing home that night, on a little known planet called Earth, Dan and Lucy Gibson find something very large and very, very shiny sticking into their house. . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762cb5dadc6bbeda79098afe0b95dcfc61fcdd39","amp;dn":"Douglas+Adams%5C%27s+Starship+Titanic+read+by+Terry+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762cb5dadc6bbeda79098afe0b95dcfc61fcdd39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,44,181,218,220,107,190,218,121,9,138,254,11,149,220,252,97,252,221,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
