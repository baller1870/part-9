Twenty-five years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy instructors like young Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of it begins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6122ee2ccd5ee9a3aac022723c4142de1810804","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6122ee2ccd5ee9a3aac022723c4142de1810804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,18,46,226,204,213,238,154,58,172,2,39,35,196,20,45,225,129,8,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
