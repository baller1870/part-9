Open \nSettings, Control Panel, System. This brings up the System Properties \nwindow.  Click on the Performance tab at the far right. This brings up \nthe Advanced Graphics Settings. Full should be used.  \n\nOn lower end systems the game will default to 640x480 screen resolution,\ntraffic visible only in the closest 2 zoom levels, and sims visible only in \nthe closest zoom level. Ways to further optimize performance are:  turn off some \nor all animations, select smaller city sizes, and run with the simulation at \nlower speeds. Music and sound also tax the system.
