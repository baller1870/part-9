Over nearly 30 years, they've gone from being America's single most influential band to a has-been group trading on past glories, to reach the 21st century as one of the most respected rock acts of their era.\n\nFor the first half of the 1970s, the Allman Brothers Band was the most influential rock group in America, redefining rock music and its boundaries. The band's mix of blues, country, jazz, and even classical influences, and their powerful, extended on-stage jamming altered the standards of concert performance -- other groups were known for their on-stage jamming, but when the Allman Brothers stretched a song out for 30 or 40 minutes, at their best they were exciting, never self-indulgent. They gave it all a distinctly Southern voice and, in the process, opened the way for a wave of '70s rock acts from south of the Mason-Dixon Line, including the Marshall Tucker Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Blackfoot, whose music, at least initially, celebrated their roots. And for a time, almost single-handedly, they also made Capricorn Records into a major independent label.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Good Clean Fun\n02.Seven Turns\n03.End Of The Line\n04.Nobody Knows\n05.Get On With Your Life\n06.No One To Run With\n07.Soulshine\n08.Blue Sky (Live)\n09.Midnight Rider (Acoustic) (Live)\n10.Jessica (Live)\n11.Please Call Home (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d356a218614f431871c94179f13c2696ac0749a7","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers++-+The+Essential+Epic+Years+%282004%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d356a218614f431871c94179f13c2696ac0749a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,86,162,24,97,79,67,24,113,201,65,121,241,60,38,150,172,7,73,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
