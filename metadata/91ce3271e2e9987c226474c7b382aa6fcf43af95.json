The corporate coalition party Heritage has won the last two elections. With another election on the horizon, the Supermajority is in tight contention, and everythingâ€™s on the line.\r\nWith power comes corruption. For Ken, this is his chance to do right by the idealistic Policy1st party and get a steady job in the big leagues. For Domaine, the election represents another staging ground in his ongoing struggle against the pax democratica. For Mishima, a dangerous Information operative, the whole situation is a puzzle: how do you keep the wheels running on the biggest political experiment of all time, when so many have so much to gain?\r\nInfomocracy is Malka Olderâ€™s debut novel.\r\nPRAISE FOR INFOMOCRACY\r\n\r\nâ€œA fast-paced, post-cyberpunk political thrillerâ€¦ If you always wanted to put The West Wing in a particle accelerator with Snow Crash to see what would happen, read this book.â€ â€”Max Gladstone, author of Last First Snow\r\nâ€œSmart, ambitious, bursting with provocative extrapolations, Infomocracy is the big-data-big-ideas-techno-analytical-microdemoglobal-post-everything political thriller weâ€™ve been waiting for.â€ â€”Ken Liu, author of The Grace of Kings\r\nâ€œIn the mid-21st century, your biggest threat isnâ€™t Artificial Intelligenceâ€”itâ€™s other people. Yet the passionate, partisan, political and ultimately fallible men and women fighting for their beliefs are also Infomocracyâ€™s greatest hope. An inspiring book about what we frail humans could still achieve, if we learn to work together.â€ â€”Karl Schroeder, author of Lockstep and the Virga saga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ce3271e2e9987c226474c7b382aa6fcf43af95","amp;dn":"Malka+Ann+Older+-+Infomocracy%3A+A+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ce3271e2e9987c226474c7b382aa6fcf43af95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,206,50,113,226,233,152,124,34,100,116,199,179,130,170,111,207,67,175,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
