The task before him was immense: to slip past a cordon of crack Chinese troops ringing his summer palace and, with an escort of 300, journey across the highest terrain in the world and over treacherous Himalayan passes to freedomÃ¢â‚¬â€one step ahead of pursuing Chinese soldiers.\nMao Zedung, ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruthless Communist dictator, had pinned his hopes for total Tibetan submission on controlling the impressionable Dalai Lama. So beloved was the young rulerÃ¢â‚¬â€so identified with his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essenceÃ¢â‚¬â€that for him to escape might mean perpetual resistance from a population unwilling to tolerate an increasingly brutal occupation. The Dalai LamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minders sent word to the Tibetan rebels and CIA-trained guerrillas who waited on the route: His Holiness must escapeÃ¢â‚¬â€at all costs.\nIn many ways, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was unprepared for the epic journey awaiting him. Twenty-two years earlier, government search parties, guided by prophecies and omens, had arrived at the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humble peasant home and subjected the two-year-old to a series of tests. After being declared the reincarnation of TibetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous ruler, the boy was brought to Lhasa to learn the secrets of Buddhism and the ways of ultimate power. Forced in the ensuing two decades to cope with aching loneliness and often stifling ritualÃ¢â‚¬â€and compelled to suppress his mischievous personalityÃ¢â‚¬â€Gyatso eventually proved himself a capable leader. But no previous Dalai Lama had ever taken on a million Communist Chinese soldiers bent on stamping out Tibetan freedom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74db4c97769ba09042f207c1fcd539ecd1d6fa94","amp;dn":"Escape+from+the+Land+of+Snows%3A+The+Young+Dalai+Lama%27s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74db4c97769ba09042f207c1fcd539ecd1d6fa94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,219,76,151,118,155,160,144,66,242,7,193,252,213,57,236,209,214,250,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
