The group began as collaboration of DJ Greyboy (turntable) with Karl Denson (saxophone, flute) during weekly shows at the Green Circle Bar in San Diego and on the DJ Greyboy albums Home Cooking and FreestylinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Together they gradually gathered musicians co-founding a house band including Robert Walter (keyboards), Chris Stillwell (bass), Elgin Park (also known as Mike Andrews) (guitar), and Zak Najor (drums). The Greyboy Allstars were a major part of the mid-90s acid jazz movement and a catalyst for renewed interest in late 60s/early 70s soul jazz. Denson has described the Greyboy Allstars as a boogaloo band, a distinction which has set them apart from other contemporary soul jazz/acid jazz combos.\n\nIn 1995, The Greyboy Allstars released their first album, West Coast Boogaloo, featuring support from James Brown trombonist and bandleader Fred Wesley. DJ Greyboy was disinterested in touring and the band continued on with his name led by Denson. In 1997 they released their second studio album, A Town Called Earth. Additionally, both Walter and Denson released solo albums backed by members of the band. Walter&amp;#039;s album, titled Spirit of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70, had additional support from Gary Bartz on alto sax, and Denson&amp;#039;s The D Stands for Diesel featured vocalist Andy Bey. The Greyboy Allstars released a live album simply entitled Live in 1999. DJ Greyboy returned to collaborate with the band for the recording of What Happened to Television? released on April 17, 2007, The Greyboy Allstars&amp;#039; first studio album in nearly 10 years.\n\nDrummer Zak Najor played drums for the studio recording of What Happened to Television? However, Eric Kalb (Deep Banana Blackout) played drums for the subsequent tour.\n\nThe band toured nationally 2008 ending in New Orleans with sold out shows during Jazz F\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb86861fc8e00902e5a9f4be136fb7c6af5f9bcb","amp;dn":"The+Greyboy+Allstars+-+What+Happened+to+Television","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb86861fc8e00902e5a9f4be136fb7c6af5f9bcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,134,134,31,200,224,9,2,229,169,244,190,19,111,183,198,175,95,155,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
