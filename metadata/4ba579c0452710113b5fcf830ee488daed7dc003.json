It is a centennial tribute and depiction of the efforts of the brothers Skladanowsky to create and show the first motion pictures, hence, much of it was filmed using antique silent-film gear. This odd feature film by director Wim Wenders and his Munich film school class began as a class assignment. The Skladanowsky brothers gave &quot;magic lantern&quot; shows in Berlin for years before taking up the challenge of developing moving pictures. Their amateur efforts resulted in their development of a projector called the &quot;Bioskop,&quot; (Bioscope), and their first commercial showing of a moving picture in Berlin in 1895 predates the Lumiere brothers' commercial showing in Paris by several weeks. The Lumiere brothers developed yet another type of film projector. Together with Edison and the Lumiere brothers, the Skladanowsky brothers deserve credit for the development of motion pictures. In this film tribute, large sections are done in the style of later silent features. In other portions of the film, Lucy Hurtgen-Skladanowsky (the very aged surviving daughter of one of the two brothers) vividly recounts her memories of the hectic activities surrounding the Bioskop premiere.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : A Trick of Light.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 959 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 763 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 1 501 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.191\n      Stream size : 817 MiB (85%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 143 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 32.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 77.6 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 129 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 17.5 --vbr-new -b 32\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 16mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 98.3 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 32.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 53.5 MiB (6%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 187 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 17.5 --vbr-new -b 32\n\nIMDB: tt0113151\n\nDual audio: film and director commentaries.\n\nFilm audio German; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nDirector commentaries English; no subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by pas6sur, subtitles added","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba579c0452710113b5fcf830ee488daed7dc003","amp;dn":"Wim+Wenders+-+Die+Gebrueder+Skladanowsky+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba579c0452710113b5fcf830ee488daed7dc003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,165,121,192,69,39,16,17,59,95,207,131,14,228,136,218,237,125,192,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
