Soldier\\&amp;#039;s Grin\n2. Call It a Ritual\n3. Language City\n4. Bang Your Drum\n5. California Dreamer\n6. The Grey Estates\n7. Fine Young Cannibals\n8. An Animal In Your Care\n9. Kissing the Beehive\n\nTheir second album for Sub Pop (following 2005\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Apologies To The Queen Mary\\&quot;) might just be this generation\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Marquee Moon\\&quot; or an indie rock \\&quot;Chinese Democracy\\&quot; released thirty years early. Better though, to think of it as the sound of a band edging forward into a wispy darkness, one hand reaching out, the other firmly clutching the past.\n\nGo out and buy it June 17th.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c59962f534a1561c43b19a4986ec037755dce8b","amp;dn":"Wolf+Parade+-+At+Mount+Zoomer+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c59962f534a1561c43b19a4986ec037755dce8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,89,150,47,83,74,21,97,196,59,25,164,152,110,192,55,117,93,206,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
