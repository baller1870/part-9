Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and recorded in October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment.\n\nWith advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group's first million seller &quot;She Loves You&quot;, the Beatles' previous UK single, which was having a resurgent spell in the top position following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top fifty for twenty-one weeks in total. It was also the group's first American number one, entering the Billboard Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number forty-five and starting the British invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February it held the number one spot Ã¢â‚¬â€ for seven weeks Ã¢â‚¬â€ before being replaced by &quot;She Loves You&quot;, a reverse scenario of what had occurred in Britain, and remained in the US charts for a total of fifteen weeks. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; became the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide.\n\nAlthough it is said that Brian Epstein had encouraged Lennon and McCartney to write a song to appeal to American listeners, this has been denied by George Martin. McCartney had recently moved into 57 Wimpole Street, London, where he was living as a guest of Dr Richard and Margaret Asher, whose daughter, actress Jane Asher, had become McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend after meeting him earlier in the year. This location briefly became Lennon and McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new writing base, taking over from McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Forthlin Road home in Liverpool. Margaret Asher taught the oboe in the &quot;small, rather stuffy music room&quot; in the basement where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'.\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KApIkaAeh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KApIkaAeh&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:24\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
