In these four dialogues, Plato develops the Socratic belief in responsibility for one s self and shows Socrates living and dying under his philosophy. In Euthyphro, Socrates debates goodness outside the courthouse; Apology sees him in court, rebutting all charges of impiety; in Crito, he refuses an entreaty to escape from prison; and in Phaedo, Socrates faces his impending death with calmness and skilful discussion of immortality.\n\nChristopher Rowe s introduction to his powerful new translation examines the book s themes of identity and confrontation, and explores how its content is less historical fact than a promotion of Plato s Socratic philosophy.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.anthroposophie.net/bilder/Socrates2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.anthroposophie.net/bilder/Socrates2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://socrates.clarke.edu/David.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://socrates.clarke.edu/David.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabut author :-\n\nPlato (c. 427Ã¢â‚¬â€œ347 b.c.) founded the Academy in Athens, the prototype of all Western universities, and wrote more than twenty philosophical dialogues.\n\n\nChristopher Rowe is professor of Greek at the University of Durham.\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b516dabbba022903040f5cd6551efb6bf094bf","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+of+Socrates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b516dabbba022903040f5cd6551efb6bf094bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,181,22,218,187,186,2,41,3,4,15,92,214,85,30,251,107,240,148,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
