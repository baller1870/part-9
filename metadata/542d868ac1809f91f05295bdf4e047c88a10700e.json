The soundtrack launched two big hits, &quot;Love Theme from St. Elmo&amp;#039;s Fire&quot; and John Parr&amp;#039;s &quot;Man in Motion (Theme from St. Elmo&amp;#039;s Fire),&quot; but those are the only two memorable pieces of the music on the album. Apart from his &quot;Love Theme,&quot; David Foster doesn&amp;#039;t manage to write music that stands apart from the movie, which makes the soundtrack a bit of a dull listen when taken on its own terms.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - St. Elmo&amp;#039;s Fire (Man in Motion) - John Parr  [4:08]\n02 - Shake Down - Billy Squier  [4:07]\n03 - Young and Innocent - Elefante  [4:34]\n04 - This Time It Was Really Right - Jon Anderson  [4:39]\n05 - Saved My LIfe - Fee Waybill  [3:45]\n06 - Love Theme from St. Elmo&amp;#039;s Fire [Instrumental] - David Foster  [3:27]\n07 - If I Turn You Away - Vikki Moss  [4:38]\n08 - Stressed Out (Close to the Edge) - Airplay  [4:14]\n09 - Georgetown - David Foster  [1:45]\n10 - Love Theme from St. Elmo&amp;#039;s Fire (For Just a Moment) - David Foster  [3:48]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542d868ac1809f91f05295bdf4e047c88a10700e","amp;dn":"St.+Elmo%5C%27s+Fire+-+Soundtrack+%281985%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542d868ac1809f91f05295bdf4e047c88a10700e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,45,134,138,193,128,159,145,240,82,149,189,244,224,71,200,138,16,112,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
