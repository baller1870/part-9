No more subs on the DVD.\n\nOne of Hugh Grant's first major films has been without a torrent since I joined the game. I have searched for this for years, and finally found the DVD.\n\nLush costume drama set at Lake Geneva in 1816, when the eccentric poet Lord Byron (Hugh Grant) is visited by the poet Percy Shelley and his wife, the writer Mary Shelley, and challenges them all to write a horror story. Mary begins her later well-known novel, Frankenstein, and imagines that the monster becomes real. With Elizabeth Hurley in an unusual part as Byron's mistress (she actually became Grant's girlfriend in real life). Also with dr. John Polidori - Byron's secretary, friend and allegedly former lover. Polidori wrote a story called The Vampyre, the first story where a vampire is a suave aristocrat (modeled on Byron, no doubt).\n\nPlease note: This is an old Spanish-English production. There are slight disturbances in the soundtrack on the DVD, especially in the beginning, as if transferred from an old optical soundtrack. But it IS stereo.\n\nFantastic music.
