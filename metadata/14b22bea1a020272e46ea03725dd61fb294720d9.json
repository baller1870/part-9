Hawkins had always wanted to record with a large string section and he received his wish on the majority of these 12 romantic melodies, all of which have some association with Paris. The surprise is that he plays with a great deal of fire (his doubletiming on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is wondrous), and that Manny AlbamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s arrangements mostly avoid being muzaky and quite often are creative and witty.  What could have been a novelty or an insipid affair is actually one of Coleman HawkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more memorable albums. ~ Scott yanow\n\nPerformers:\nColeman Hawkins with Manny Albam and His Orchestra\n\nColeman Hawkins - The Hawk In Paris Tracks: \n01  April in Paris Duke, Harburg 3:53\n02  Mon Homme (My Man) Salabert, Yain 3:19\n03  Under Paris Skies Drejac, Gannon, Giraud 2:46\n04  Mimi Hart, Rodgers 3:08\n05  La Chnouf Lanjean 3:07\n06  La Vie en Rose David, Louiguy, Piaf 2:37\n07  La Mer (Beyond the Sea) Lasry, Trenet 3:33\n08  Paris in the Spring Gordon, Revel 3:15\n09  I Love Paris Porter 3:31\n10  Mademoiselle de Paris Contet, Durand, Maschwitz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ 3:19\n11  Chiens Perdus Sans Collier (The Little Lost Dog) Bacri, Misraki 2:58\n12  Tu NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Peux TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Figurer (Dawn over Paris) Misraki 3:22\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b22bea1a020272e46ea03725dd61fb294720d9","amp;dn":"Coleman+Hawkins+-+The+Hawk+In+Paris+%281956%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b22bea1a020272e46ea03725dd61fb294720d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,178,43,234,26,2,2,114,228,110,160,55,37,221,97,251,41,71,32,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
