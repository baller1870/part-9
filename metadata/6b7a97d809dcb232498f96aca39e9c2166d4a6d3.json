The film stars Ernest Borgnine, Zohra Lampert, Alan Austin, Renata Vanni and Bruno Della Santina. \n\nBased on real incidents in the life and death of Lt. Joseph Petrosino (Ernest Borgnine) of the New York police force, this tale set between 1906-1909 details the history of the lieutenant's fight to prove Sicilian Mafia involvement \nin crimes in his city. Lt. Petrosino has a series of dangerous close calls as he distinguishes himself by saving singer Enrico Caruso from a Mafia bomb outside the Metropolitan Opera, and by also saving the father of Adelina (Zohra Lampert) the woman he loves. Several other exploits eventually lead to Petrosino's trip to Sicily to nail evidence for the Mafia's activities in New York, and for a final meeting with destiny. \n\nFrom the late 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s through the early 1960Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s the largest wave of gangster films were produced since the golden age of the 1930Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. Though mostly low budget, within a span of six years we saw Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Baby Face NelsonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Machine Gun KellyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Al CaponeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Purple GangÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Young DillingerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bonnie Parker StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Rise and Fall of Legs DiamondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Portrait of a MobsterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad Dog CollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“King of The Roaring TwentiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Murder Inc.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Scarface MobÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (two episodes of the TV series The Untouchables released as a feature film) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pay or Die.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Of all these films, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pay or DieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Murder Inc.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are arguably the most important of the group and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pay or DieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the only one of the films to focus on a heroic American figure in fighting crime.\n\nSome titbits about him.\nOne notable case in Petrosino's stint with the Italian Squad was when the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso, who was performing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, was being blackmailed by Black Hand gangsters who demanded money in exchange for his life.It was Petrosino who convinced Caruso to help him catch those behind the blackmail.\n\nA second notable case in Petrosino's stint with the Italian Squad was his infiltration of an Italian-based anarchist organization that assassinated King Umberto I of Italy.\nDuring his mission, he discovered evidence that the organization intended to assassinate President William McKinley during his trip to Buffalo.Petrosino warned the Secret Service, but McKinley ignored the warning, even after Roosevelt, who had by this time become Vice-President of the United States, vouched for Petrosino's abilities.McKinley was assassinated by Leon Czolgosz during his visit to Buffalo's Pan-American Exposition on September 6, 1901\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 872mb\nDuration.... 01:51:07\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 718\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 967kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 124kbps\n2 Channel stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7a97d809dcb232498f96aca39e9c2166d4a6d3","amp;dn":"Pay+Or+Die+1960+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7a97d809dcb232498f96aca39e9c2166d4a6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,122,151,216,9,220,178,50,73,143,150,172,163,158,156,33,102,212,166,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
