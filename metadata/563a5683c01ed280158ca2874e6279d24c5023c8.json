Intelligent, resizable design library of the US, ECMA, FEFCO and display standards make design decisions for you. A powerful rebuild design feature allows designs to be parametrically rebuilt with new geometric values.\n\n\nReduce production costs\nStructural design and graphic design integration with productions files eliminate costly mistakes down stream in the workflow.\n\n\nartioscad (software) cutting\nPackaging CAD software\nPackaging CAD software or a complete packaging CAD system differs from other 3D editors. ArtiosCAD comes with very specific packaging knowledge and tools. Dedicated packaging functionality makes it not only easier to design packaging and displays. It also makes it possible to deliver the results your customers expect in the shortest amount of time. ArtiosCADÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s level of packaging expertise is second to none. Packaging professionals work best with a complete packaging CAD system, and ArtiosCAD is the absolute standard.\n\nComplete solutions from one company means native compatibility between ArtiosCAD and sample making or display producing with a Kongsberg cutting table.\n\nDesigning displays\nArtiosCAD has the tools to quickly design POP (Point of Purchace), POS (Point of Sale) and FSDU (Free Standing Display Units) displays. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working in corrugated carton, in re-board or other rigid materials, ArtiosCAD makes it easy and straightforward to design POS, POP, FSDU... Start from scratch or run one of many display standards. With dedicated 3D tools, ArtiosCAD allows you to assembly the separate parts of the displays without any hassles.\n\nhink in 3D, design in 3D\nPackaging designers often think in 3D but must draw a structural design on a 2-dimensional Ã¢â‚¬Å“drawing boardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Now designerscan actually start creating packaging designs in 3D with ArtiosCAD. Users start with a product model and automaticallyresize a Standard design to fit the product. Dedicated tools allow users to create internal fitments andwindows that follow the productÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shape.\n\nArtiosCAD creates a variety of 3D models of commonpackaging products like cans, bottles, glasses and bags. Theseproduct models support parametric design, allowing users to resizea single model to create a wide variety of shapes and sizes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563a5683c01ed280158ca2874e6279d24c5023c8","amp;dn":"Artios+CAD+Version+7.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563a5683c01ed280158ca2874e6279d24c5023c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,58,86,131,192,30,210,128,21,140,162,135,78,98,121,210,76,80,35,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
