Her music is associated with the anti-folk scene centered in New York City's East Village. \r\n\r\nHer songs show influences from folk, punk, rock, Jewish, Russian, hip hop, jazz, and classical music. Spektor has said that she works hard to ensure that each of her songs has its own musical style, rather than trying to develop a distinctive style for her music as a whole. \r\n\r\nSpektor has a broad vocal range and uses the full extent of it. She also explores a variety of different and somewhat unorthodox vocal techniques, such as verses composed entirely of buzzing noises made with the lips and beatbox-style flourishes in the middle of ballads, and also makes use of such unusual musical techniques as using a drum stick to tap rhythms on the body of the piano or chair. Part of her style also results from the exaggeration of certain aspects of vocalization, most notably the glottal stop, which is prominent in the single Fidelity. Her lyrics are equally eclectic, often taking the form of abstract narratives or first-person character studies, similar to short stories or vignettes put to song.\r\n\r\nLive In London is the first live album by Russian-American alternative singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, recorded at the Hammersmith Apollo Theatre, in London, during her Far Tour, and released worldwide through Sire Records on November 22, 2010. The video was directed by Adria Petty   (wikipedia)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegina Spektor - Live in London 2009 - CD\r\n\r\nCD\r\n\r\n 1. On the radio\r\n 2. Eet\r\n 3. Folding chair\r\n 4. Sailor song\r\n 5.
