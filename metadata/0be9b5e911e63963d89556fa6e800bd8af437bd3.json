With Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube, he recorded and published, over a period of six years, a remarkable collection of folktales from northern India.\n\nThe tales reflect the tapestry of social and personal lives of this region, the epicenter of a revolt against British rule in 1857. Although many of the tales were published in British ethnographic journals, a number of the manuscripts, in Chaube's handwriting, were unpublished; others existed only as old microfilm in a New Delhi library. Never before have they appeared as a single volume or been available in any one library or archive.\n\nFeatures\nIncludes the original versions of over 350 Indian folktales collected in colonial India during the 1890s\nIntroduction by Sadhana Naithani provides an overview of William Crooke's methodology and translation practices\nHighlights\nOffers classic folktales from a wide range of original narratorsÃ¢â‚¬â€professional storytellers belonging to the aboriginal races of India, village school teachers, and rural and common people\nPortrays the universal themes common to the various tales\nIncludes a detailed introduction placing the tales in context with modern research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be9b5e911e63963d89556fa6e800bd8af437bd3","amp;dn":"Folktales+from+Northern+India.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be9b5e911e63963d89556fa6e800bd8af437bd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,233,181,233,17,230,57,99,216,149,86,250,110,128,11,216,175,67,123,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
