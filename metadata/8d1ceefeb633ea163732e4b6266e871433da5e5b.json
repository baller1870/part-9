The recordings are stunningly powerful for a chamber orchestra. Released by Teldec in 1991, this cycle won the Gramophone Orchestral Award in 1992. I think that this is my favourite Beethoven symphony cycle; it is certainly the one I return to most often.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d1ceefeb633ea163732e4b6266e871433da5e5b","amp;dn":"Beethoven+-+The+Symphonies+-+Harnoncourt%2C+COE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d1ceefeb633ea163732e4b6266e871433da5e5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,28,238,254,182,51,234,22,55,50,228,182,38,110,135,20,51,218,94,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
