By revealing the contemporary colloquial language locals actually speak, this book presents cool things to say for all casual situations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ shopping, parties, nightclubs, sporting events, and even romance and sex. There are truly phrases for every situation, from sweet words to entice a local beauty to less-than-comrade-like rebuffs for overly zealous street vendors. Fun to read with an attitude that reflects the outrageous content, Dirty Chinese even includes the harsh expressions one might use to convince a local police officer that the delay needs to end and he has been tipped enough. An invaluable guide for the off-the-beaten-path traveler, the book features a pronunciation guide and sample dialogues and is packed with enough insults and swear words to offend every person in China without mentioning the age of their Olympic gymnasts. It even includes sex terminology graphic enough to embarrass the operators of Hong Kong's infamous &quot;one-woman brothels.&quot;\n\nPaperback: 128 pages \nPublisher: Ulysses Press (February 9, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9422d113f7627171e18b768cedfac5f702dc3656","amp;dn":"Dirty+Chinese%3A+Everyday+Slang+from+What%5C%27s+Up+to+Fuck+Off","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9422d113f7627171e18b768cedfac5f702dc3656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,34,209,19,247,98,113,113,225,139,118,140,237,250,197,247,2,220,54,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
