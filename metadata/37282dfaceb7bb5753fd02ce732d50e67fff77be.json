The world was dangerous. And he was alone. Fisher is the last boy on Earth - and things are not looking good for the human race. The carefully crafted survival dome where Fisher and dozens of other humans have been sleeping for millenia has been destroyed. Through a lucky accident, only Fisher survived.The world Fisher wakes up in is a lot like ours - but it's changed, too. After the human race wiped itself out, nature took over, and wild creatures evolved into barely familiar beasts. Fisher must face them all as they set off on a journey that seems hopeless - at first. Then Fisher uncovers evidence that there may be a second survival dome far to the west. What was once a struggle for one boy's survival becomes a journey of hope.With a broken robot and a friendly mammoth as his only companions, Fisher heads West. But something is watching them... something that wants to find the second survival dome just as badly as they do.\n\n\nReview\n\n&quot;Fisher's survivalist journey through the ruins of our future is both funny and affecting, full of transformed creatures, broken cities, and mad robots. Amid desperate escapes, explosive battles and piles of mammoth dung, The Boy at the End of the World, also manages to ask interesting questions about our place in the world, and where we're headed as a species.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Paolo Bacigalupi, Printz Award winning author of *Ship Breaker\n\n&quot;Greg van Eekhout's The Boy at the End of the World is both moving and full of adventure. This remarkable survival story will change the way readers think about themselves and the world they live in.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Sarah Prineas, author of The Magic Thief\n\n*\n\n&quot;Greg van Eekhout's The Boy at the End of the World is wholly engaging and action packed. It is a compelling journey story filled with unusual friendships and a vision of the future that doesn't shy away from eco-heavy messages and themes as it plunges the reader ever forward toward a riveting, cinematic end.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Ingrid Law, Newbery Honor author of *Savvy\n\n*\n\n&quot;The characters are well developed and the moral dilemmas are sound. This is an excellent beginning for science fiction readers and the study of dystopian society. Recommended.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€* Library Media Connection\n\n*\n\n&quot;The author of Kid vs. Squid (2010) repeats with another quirky, high-stakes adventure hung about with oddball ideas and life-threatening hazards... Van Eekhout moves his tale along briskly to a violent, suspenseful climaxÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ A pleaser for readers who prefer their sf livened up with unpredictable elements and emotional complexity.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€*Booklist\n\n*\n\n&quot;Part speculative fiction, part cinematic survival adventure, the novel features a brisk pace and clever and snappy dialogue. The real, scary possibility of human destruction of our own environment is tempered by this diverting tale of the possibilities of continued existence and the meaning of hope, friendship and community.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€*Kirkus Reviews *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37282dfaceb7bb5753fd02ce732d50e67fff77be","amp;dn":"The+Boy+at+The+End+of+The+World+-+Greg+Van+Eekhout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37282dfaceb7bb5753fd02ce732d50e67fff77be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,40,45,250,206,183,187,87,83,253,2,206,115,45,80,230,127,255,119,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
