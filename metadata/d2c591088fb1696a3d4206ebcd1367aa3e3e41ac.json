As a result, the majority of technological progress to date appears in system-level device development. More recently, biomechanical initiatives are investigating biological sub-systems such as tissues, cells, and molecules. Fueled by advances in experimental methods and instrumentation, these initiatives, in turn, directly drive the development of biological nano- and microtechnologies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c591088fb1696a3d4206ebcd1367aa3e3e41ac","amp;dn":"Biomechanics%3A+Principles+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c591088fb1696a3d4206ebcd1367aa3e3e41ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,197,145,8,143,177,105,106,61,66,6,235,205,19,103,170,62,62,65,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
