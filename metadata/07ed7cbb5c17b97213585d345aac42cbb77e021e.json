Based in Burton-upon-Trent, England, the Telescopes consisted of vocalist Stephen Lawrie, guitarist Joanna Doran, guitarist David Fitzgerald, bassist Robert Brooks, and drummer Dominic Dillon. They made their debut on a couple of independent singles and the 1989 EP 7th Disaster, and then switched to the What Goes On label for two more EPs and a full-length debut, Taste, that same year, experimenting with violins, trumpets, and dynamic contrasts. The live album, Trade Mark of Quality, was released as part of a series also including Spacemen 3 and the Pooh Sticks by the Fierce label in 1990, but the same year, What Goes On went bankrupt. The Telescopes found their way to Creation for several more EPs (including Everso and Celeste) that began to display the band&amp;#039;s pop melodies and garage psychedelic leanings to a greater degree. Their single &amp;#039;Flying&amp;#039; became a minor U.K. hit in 1991, but the follow-up self-titled album was the last Telescopes product to appear until 2002&amp;#039;s Third Wave, which has been gaining them lots of new fans, showcasing their more in a more experimental, yet still psychedelic direction.\n\nAlbum:\n\n1.
