Produced by Andy Paley (who also plays on it) , the album was recorded with what can best be described as an early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s Folk aesthetic. Jonathan may have used an old Harmony or Stella archtop as his main guitar and it sounds like most of the record was recorded 'Live in Studio' with maybe one or two old tube microphones. The drums are magnificently played and toneful as is the guitarron (Mexican acoustic bass). All this makes for a charming nostalgic '50s feel, without actually pandering to the past in any way. In no way is it a send up of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s or tongue-in-cheek (IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve noticed a baffling tendency of some fans to think otherwise). Performances are top notch all around and there is a beguiling warmth to the album that, armed with such memorable songs as opener 'It's You', makes for a lifelong keeper.\n\nI bought 'It's Time For' in 1986 when I was 16 and I was startled then by how 'old' it sounded. Remember this was a time of synths and gated snares. There was a healthy underground happening of course and it was on publicly sponsored radio late at night that I heard the beautiful doo-wop of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCorner StoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. I remember the DJ introducing the record as being by Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of Lou ReedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best creations: Jonathan RichmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. You can never say too much about instant Like. After all, who needed time to appreciate The Beatles? You heard Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Can Work It OutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and right away knew what good music was supposed to sound like. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the reason small children universally like The Beatles. Outside of thought and discourse, there is a universal truth that good music will get across. So I was hooked the moment I heard JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœCorner StoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. I hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t heard the cultish first Modern Lovers album yet. I had no idea how angular sounding and forward-thinking Jonathan was in the past. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter. I put Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time For..Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ on my shopping list and picked it up later that Summer.\n\n\n&quot;I don't care if I have to walk further; I'll walk further, I'll pay more...\nI don't really want what the new mall's got; I want what they got in that Corner Store...&quot;\n\n\nAs luck would have it, I would go to see Jonathan Richman promote the album at a show not long after. He was to play 2 concerts, a regular night show and also an afternoon all-ages one for kids. I opted for the former and ended up seeing one of my all-time favorite performances by anyone, ever. On stage, he played the new album almost in its entirety as well as classics from before but with the same stripped down early rock and roll trio that had worked so well on the recording. A natural performer, he had the audience hanging on his every word and action. For those of you who have maybe wondered if Jonathan, the author of Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m StraightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ had ever secretly inhaled, he made an interesting comment: Stepping out from backstage, he took a swig of what looked like water saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is cod liver oil; TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all smoking ugly hash smoke backstage. I need to lubricate my throat!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Make of that what you will. At least we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rule out the possibility of a contact high.\n\nKidding aside and back to the point, Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Time ForÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ represents a definite career peak for Jonathan Richman in my opinion. Long out of print, its songs are all well above par. If Jonathan Mach II had ever sounded over-the-top on his post ML work, here he sounds right at home, totally believable and direct.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Why does the desert make my heart go thrum, well the Martians land there and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not dumbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nA good friend of mine is right into Jonathan and she even had opportunity to meet the man when he dropped by a local community radio station. I had asked her to tell Jonathan that a fan of his held Ã¢â‚¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Time ForÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ in the highest regard. His response was apparently quite nonchalant, even suggesting that he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really hold the record that highly himself, if he even thought about it very much at all. Whatever, we know that he cared enough about the righteously political Ã¢â‚¬ËœCorner StoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as it has been re-recorded as a Country arrangement on Jonathan Goes Country and it was also featured in the comedy Ã¢â‚¬ËœKingpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (same version).\n\nThe sentiment expressed in Ã¢â‚¬ËœCorner StoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the same as the one put across in the ML classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœOld WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (I still love the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s and I still love the Old WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I wanna keep my place in the old worldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦). This time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the encroachment of generic big box mega-stores that Jonathan wished to keep at bay by vowing his allegiance to the old wooden floored Mom and Pop-owned Corner Store. The thing is, Jonathan really connects with his audience with these sentiments. Like many other successful pop orators, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reminded us of Important Things; things just down the street in our own neighborhoods. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a recurring theme in much of his work but nowhere is it as succinct than in this original, doo-wop version of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCorner StoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nNo Jonathan Richman collection is complete without this enduring set","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a98473210e84f59ab0e98e5b2c840875ee4a351","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Richman+-+1986+-+It%27s+Time+For+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a98473210e84f59ab0e98e5b2c840875ee4a351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,152,71,50,16,232,79,89,171,14,152,229,178,200,64,135,94,228,163,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
