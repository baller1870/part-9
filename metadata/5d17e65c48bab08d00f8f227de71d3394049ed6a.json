He was a co-founding member of Nite City from 1977 to 1978, and of ManzarekÃ¢â‚¬â€œKrieger from 2001 to his death.\nEarly life and career\nManzarek was of Polish descent, born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, as were his parents, Helena and Raymond Manczarek.[2] Growing up, he took private piano lessons from Bruno Michelotti and others. He originally wanted to play basketball, but he only wanted to play power forward or center. When he was sixteen his coach insisted either he play guard or not at all and he quit the team. Manzarek said later if it was not for that ultimatum, he might never have been with the Doors. He went to Everett Elementary School on South Bell Street and attended St. Rita High School in Chicago. He graduated from DePaul University with a degree in economics and played in many shows at the school.\nFrom 1962 to 1965, he studied in the Department of Cinematography at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he met film student Jim Morrison. At UCLA, he also met Dorothy Fujikawa, whom he married. Forty days after finishing film school, thinking they had gone their separate ways, Manzarek and Morrison met by chance on Venice Beach in California. Morrison said he had written some songs, and Manzarek expressed an interest in hearing them, whereupon Morrison sang a rough version of &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;. Manzarek liked the songs and co-founded the Doors with Morrison at that moment.\nManzarek met drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger at a Transcendental Meditation lecture. Densmore says, &quot;There wouldn't be any Doors without Maharishi.\nDensmore, Krieger, Manzarek and Morrison in a publicity photo from 1966\nIn January 1966, the Doors became the house band at the London Fog on the Sunset Strip. According to Manzarek, &quot;Nobody ever came in the place...an occasional sailor or two on leave, a few drunks. All in all it was a very depressing experience, but it gave us time to really get the music together.&quot; The same day the Doors were fired from the London Fog, they were hired to be the house band of the Whisky a Go Go. Their first performance at the Whisky was with the group Them.\nThe Doors' first recording contract was with Columbia Records. After a few months of inactivity, they learned they were on Columbia's drop list. At that point, they asked to be released from their contract. After a few months of live gigs, Jac Holzman &quot;rediscovered&quot; the Doors and signed them to Elektra Records.\nThe Doors lacked a bassist, so Manzarek usually played the bass parts on a Fender Rhodes piano. His signature sound is that of the Vox Continental combo organ, an instrument used by many other psychedelic rock bands of the era. He later used a Gibson G-101 Kalamazoo combo organ (which looks like a Farfisa) because the Continental's plastic keys frequently broke, according to Manzarek.\nManzarek occasionally sang for the Doors, including the live recording &quot;Close To You&quot; and on the B-side of &quot;Love Her Madly,&quot; &quot;You Need Meat (Don't Go No Further).&quot; He also sang on the last two Doors albums, recorded after Morrison's death, Other Voices and Full Circle. Additionally, he provided one of several guitar parts on the song &quot;Been Down So Long.&quot;\nPersonal life and death\nManzarek married Dorothy Aiko Fujikawa in Los Angeles on December 21, 1967, with Jim Morrison and his long time companion, Pamela Courson, as witnesses. Manzarek and Fujikawa remained married until his death. They had a son, Pablo, and three grandchildren.\nOn May 20, 2013, Manzarek died after a long battle with bile duct cancer at a hospital in Rosenheim, Germany, aged 74. Robby Krieger said, &quot;I was deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my friend and bandmate Ray Manzarek today. I'm just glad to have been able to have played Doors songs with him for the last decade. Ray was a huge part of my life and I will always miss him.&quot; John Densmore said, &quot;There was no keyboard player on the planet more appropriate to support Jim Morrison's words. Ray, I felt totally in sync with you musically. It was like we were of one mind, holding down the foundation for Robby and Jim to float on top of. I will miss my musical brother.&quot;\nGreg Harris, the CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said in reaction to Manzarek's death that &quot;The world of rock 'n' roll lost one of its greats with the passing of Ray Manzarek.&quot; Harris also said that &quot;he was instrumental in shaping one of the most influential, controversial and revolutionary groups of the '60s. Such memorable tracks as 'Light My Fire', 'People are Strange' and 'Hello, I Love You' Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to name but a few Ã¢â‚¬â€œ owe much to Manzarek's innovative playing.&quot;\n\n\nAlbum List:\n\n(1973) Ray Manzarek - The Golden Scarab\n(1974) Ray Manzarek - The Whole Thing Started with Rock &amp; Roll Now It's Out of Control\n(1983) Ray Manzarek - Carmina Burana\n(2006) Ray Manzarek - Love Her Madly\n(2008) Ray Manzarek &amp; Roy Rogers - Ballads Before The Rain\n(2011) Ray Manzarek &amp; Roy Rogers - Translucent Blues\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Rock\nStyles: Psychedelic rock, acid rock, blues rock, jazz rock, hard rock, blues, jazz fusion, funk,\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate : ~ 692-942 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d17e65c48bab08d00f8f227de71d3394049ed6a","amp;dn":"Ray+Manzarek+6+Albums+%5BFLAC%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d17e65c48bab08d00f8f227de71d3394049ed6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,23,230,92,72,186,176,141,0,248,242,39,222,113,211,57,64,73,237,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
