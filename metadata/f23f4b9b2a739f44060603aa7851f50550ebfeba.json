Crazy, relentless, all-powerful love. Have you ever wondered if weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re missing it? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crazy, if you think about it. The God of the universe--the Creator of nitrogen and pine needles, galaxies and E-minor--loves us with a radical, unconditional, self-sacrificing love. And what is our typical response? We go to church, sing songs, and try not to cuss. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve verbalized it yet or not...we all know somethings wrong. Does something deep inside your heart long to break free from the status quo? Are you hungry for an authentic faith that addresses the problems of our world with tangible, even radical, solutions? God is calling you to a passionate love relationship with Himself. Because the answer to religious complacency isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t working harder at a list of doÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ts--itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s falling in love with God. And once you encounter His love, as Francis Chan describes it, you will never be the same. Because when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re wildly in love with someone, it changes everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f23f4b9b2a739f44060603aa7851f50550ebfeba","amp;dn":"Crazy+Love+-+Francis+Chan+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f23f4b9b2a739f44060603aa7851f50550ebfeba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,63,75,155,42,115,159,68,6,6,3,170,120,81,245,5,80,235,254,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
