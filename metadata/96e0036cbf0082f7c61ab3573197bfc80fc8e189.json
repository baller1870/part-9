Mikey Heppner was playing with The Dropouts at the time when three of its members headed to New York to form The Stills. Left on his own, Heppner formed a new band in the form of Priestess. In 2005, the band released their debut album, Hello Master. The release was issued via Indica in Canada and on Ace Fu in the U.S. A major-label recording contract with RCA followed in January 2006. North American tour dates opening for Dinosaur Jr. followed that spring. Priestess also toured with The Sword, Early Man and Diamond Nights in the spring of 2006.\n\nA remastered version of Hello Master arrived in June, and additional shows with the Riverboat Gamblers and the Bronx coincided with its release. Upon the album's re-release, tracks such as &quot;Talk to Her&quot; and &quot;Lay Down&quot; also began finding airplay on mainstream rock satellite stations such as Octane and Ink'd. On October 27, 2006, Priestess joined Black Label Society and Black Stone Cherry's already-in-progress tour which lasted until mid-December. Priestess toured with Converge and Mastodon from January 26 - February 17, 2007. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e0036cbf0082f7c61ab3573197bfc80fc8e189","amp;dn":"Priestess+-+Prior+To+The+Fire+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e0036cbf0082f7c61ab3573197bfc80fc8e189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,224,3,108,191,0,130,247,198,26,179,87,49,151,191,200,15,200,225,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
