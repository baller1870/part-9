Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty.  His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values.  His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR.\n\n\nWith the exception of STRAIT IS THE GATE (ePub), the following books are in PDF format, all of which are either new or reprocessed scans with contents in bookmarks and accurate pagination:\n\n* BACK FROM THE U.S.S.R.
