Home is an entirely independent, deeply affecting novel that takes place concurrently in the same locale, this time in the household of Reverend Robert Boughton, Ames's closest friend.\n\nGlory Boughton, aged thirty-eight, has returned to Gilead to care for her dying father. Soon her brother, Jack - the prodigal son of the family, gone for twenty years - comes home too, looking for refuge and trying to make peace with a past littered with tormenting trouble and pain.\n\nJack is one of the great characters in recent literature. A bad boy from childhood, an alcoholic who cannot hold a job, he is perpetually at odds with his surroundings and with his traditionalist father, though he remains Boughton's most beloved child. Brilliant, lovable, and wayward, Jack forges an intense bond with Glory and engages painfully with Ames, his godfather and namesake.\n\nHome is a moving and healing book about families, family secrets, and the passing of the generations, about love and death and faith. It is RobinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest work, an unforgettable embodiment of the deepest and most universal emotions.\n\nHome is a 2008 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.\n\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nStarred Review. Robinson's beautiful new novel, a companion piece to her Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning Gilead, is an elegant variation on the parable of the prodigal son's return. The son is Jack Boughton, one of the eight children of Robert Boughton, the former Gilead, Iowa, pastor, who now, in 1957, is a widowed and dying man. Jack returns home shortly after his sister, 38-year-old Glory, moves in to nurse their father, and it is through Glory's eyes that we see Jack's drama unfold. When Glory last laid eyes on Jack, she was 16, and he was leaving Gilead with a reputation as a thief and a scoundrel, having just gotten an underage girl pregnant. By his account, he'd since lived as a vagrant, drunk and jailbird until he fell in with a woman named Della in St. Louis. By degrees, Jack and Glory bond while taking care of their father, but when Jack's letters to Della are returned unopened, Glory has to deal with Jack's relapse into bad habits and the effect it has on their father. In giving an ancient drama of grace and perdition such a strong domestic setup, Robinson stakes a fierce claim to a divine recognition behind the rituals of home.\n\n------------\n\nGilead is available (pdf only) here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8506483&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8506483&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de048c4c935c598603dde936d8fdf6b4b173804","amp;dn":"Marilynne+Robinson+-+Home+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de048c4c935c598603dde936d8fdf6b4b173804","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,224,72,196,201,53,197,152,96,61,222,147,109,143,223,107,75,23,56,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
