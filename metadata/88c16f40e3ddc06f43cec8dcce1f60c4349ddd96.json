Artise Originals. Fashion gave her a second chance at happiness and success, and, in turn, she gives vintage garments that have lost their luster another chance at being fashionable. Mixing contemporary clothing with the best elements of a vintage pieceÃ¢â‚¬â€like the collar of a funky fifties housedress or the pockets of a seventies-style jacketÃ¢â‚¬â€and piecing them back together in a whole new way, she creates one-of-a-kind garments that are both trend setting and timeless.\nAn old-fashioned ruffled shirt with terrific buttons, plus an inexpensive tank top, can become a unique top. A poodle skirt and that so-last-yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knee-length cardigan sweater can be turned into anything from a mini-poncho to a structured tube top. With fashions for every season, Born-Again Vintage contains patterns for:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pants that pair perfectly with winter boots and a sweater dress thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexy and simple\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢A cropped jacket + sweater corset that are perfect for a flirty spring fling\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Dresses + bags to keep summer easy and breezy\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pretty-in-a-blink dresses + accessories for a big night out\n\nBorn-Again Vintage updates the trends of fashion eras gone by and brings the unparalleled quality of vintage into a new age. Complete with a vintage shopping guide, handy style tips, and ideas for reinventing disused cast-offs, Born-Again Vintage is a must-have for vintage shoppers and sewers alike.\n\nAbout the Authors\nBRIDGETT ARTISE, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of the Technology in New York, is best known as the up-and-coming fashion designer behind the indie label B.
