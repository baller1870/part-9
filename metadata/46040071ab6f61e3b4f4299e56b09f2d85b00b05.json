The world's leading surgeons describe and demonstrate the most advanced and successful techniques for all types of general surgery, aesthetic, and reconstructive proceduresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½oncologic management of breast disease, breast reconstruction, reduction mammoplasty and mastopexy, and augmentation mammoplasty. The text is illustrated throughout with over 4,100 drawings and full-color preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative photographs. Editorial comments at the end of each chapter provide an alternative perspective and address current controversies.\n\nThis thoroughly updated Third Edition features a greatly expanded section on augmentation mammoplasty. Other new chapters cover deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction, skin preserving delayed breast reconstruction, and nipple-sparing mastectomy. Coverage also includes new information on managing oncoplastic surgery, surveillance following breast reconstruction, reconstruction following tumor recurrence, and the role of stem cells.\n\n\nReview\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery , Boyd R. Burkhardt, MD -- &quot;...Dr. Spear and his associate editors have again compiled an invaluable, definitive, and virtually encyclopedic scientific reference to the entire spectrum of breast surgery. With five editors and 123 individual contributing experts from nine different countries, one must admire not only the knowledge and effort but also the interpersonal and organizational skills required to assemble and coordinate such an international cast of authors. The product is a beautiful two-volume set delivered in a large textbook-style format of more than 1500 pages. Throughout the text, one appreciates the high quality of the abundant illustrations and color photographs and the use of pastel shading to highlight the chapter headings and the subunit headings within each chapter. My favorite feature, however, is the short, italicized, independent commentary inserted at the end of each chapter in which a separate authority offers orientation, support, and sometimes even caution about the chapter's content... Of all the valuable content, I must confess that my personal (and emotional) favorite was chapter 102, Managing Complications of Augmentation Mammaplasty, by Neal Handel...&quot; --This \n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 1792 pages\n# Publisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; Third edition (November 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1605475777\n# ISBN-13: 978-1605475776","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46040071ab6f61e3b4f4299e56b09f2d85b00b05","amp;dn":"Surgery+of+the+Breast%3A+Principles+and+Art%2C3rd+Ed%282Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46040071ab6f61e3b4f4299e56b09f2d85b00b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,4,0,113,171,111,97,227,180,244,41,158,86,176,159,45,133,176,11,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
