It has full VCD/DVD playback functionality. KMPlayer is a versatile media player which utilizes all kinds of video information and subtitles to bring the best video experience through software/hardware options and recognition of various display devices. The player provides a strong hybrid structure efficient for interconnecting various directshow filters, winamp input&amp;dsp plugin, and internal filters.

The player provides both internal and external filters with a fully controlled environment in terms of connections to other splitters, decoders, audio/video transform filters and renderers without grappling with the DirectShow merit system.\n \nInternal filters are not registered to user's system to keep it from being messed up with system filters.\n\n \nThe KMPlayer includes almost all the essential decoders required for media playback. Furthermore, to get beyond the limitation of internal decoders, the external ones such as commercial h.264 decoders or cyberlink/intervideo audio decoders can be specified, so that KMP works optimally by the users' own customization. Even though the KMP is based upon directshow structure, it supports Winamp, Realmedia and Quicktime by the internal logic.
