They also invent entirely new economic systems, like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Work,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a New Deal for the technological era. Barefoot bankers cross the nation, microinvesting in high-tech communal mini-startups like Perry and LesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Together, they transform the country, and Andrea Fleeks, a journo-turned-blogger, is there to document it. Then it slides into collapse. The New Work bust puts the dot.combomb to shame. Perry and Lester build a network of interactive rides in abandoned Wal-Marts across the land. As their rides, which commemorate the New WorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s glory days, gain in popularity, a rogue Disney executive grows jealous, and convinces the police that Perry and LesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 3D printers are being used to run off AK-47s. Hordes of goths descend on the shantytown built by the New Workers, joining the cult. Lawsuits multiply as venture capitalists take on a new investment strategy: backing litigation against companies like Disney. Lester and PerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship falls to pieces when Lester gets the Ã¢â‚¬ËœfatkinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ treatment, turning him into a sybaritic gigolo. Then things get really interesting.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b118a0b6b261a2e8d46f4af7ca84316db4a1b6d","amp;dn":"Doctorow_Cory-Makers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b118a0b6b261a2e8d46f4af7ca84316db4a1b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,17,138,11,107,38,26,46,141,70,244,175,124,168,67,22,219,74,27,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
