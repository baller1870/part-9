This book provides an in-depth and wide-ranging introduction to the subject, emphasizing throughout the basic principles and their applications. The book begins by developing the basic tools of quantum optics, and goes on to show the application of these tools in a variety of quantum optical systems, including lasing without inversion, squeezed states, and atom optics. The final four chapters discuss quantum optical tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics, and particular aspects of measurement theory. Assuming only a background of standard quantum mechanics and electromagnetic theory, and containing many problems and references, this book will be invaluable to graduate students of quantum optics, as well as to researchers in this field.\n\n\nLingua-Language: English\nEditore-Publisher:  Visit this link: http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521435951&amp;utm_source=DOI&amp;utm_medium=MultiLink&amp;utm_content=0521435951&amp;utm_campaign=CDi\nData-Age: September 28, 1997\npagine - pages: 652 pagine \nAutori-Writers: Scully M.O. - Zubairy M.S. \nISBN: 978-0521435956\nCosto-Price:  Visit this link: http://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Optics-Marlan-O-Scully/dp/0521435951\nDimensione-Size: 10 MB\nExtension-Formato: DJVU (scan)\nTipologia di file: scan 400 dpi b/n\nOCR: SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬\n\n Visit this link: http://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=178880&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=12015072\n\n Visit this link: http://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=178880&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=12015077\n\n Visit this link: http://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=178880&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=12015083\n\n Visit this link: http://forum.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/tntforum/index.php?showtopic=178880&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=12015087\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bf1c02a6f7b56bfc6fa49bc9d3b53d18e353ee","amp;dn":"Scully+M.O.%2C+Zubairy+M.S.+Quantum+optics+%28CUP%2C+1997%29%28ISBN+052143","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bf1c02a6f7b56bfc6fa49bc9d3b53d18e353ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,191,28,2,166,247,181,107,252,111,164,155,201,211,181,61,24,227,83,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
