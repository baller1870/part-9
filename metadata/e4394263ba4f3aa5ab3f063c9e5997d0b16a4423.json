The text traces the history of western philosophy from its beginnings in ancient Greece to contemporary developments in the modern world. Threads running through the text demonstrate how philosophy is unique and distinct from religion and science, while at the same time showing how all three disciplines are interrelated. Exceptionally well written, and unusual in its cohesiveness, the text leaves you with a vivid picture of philosophy as a unique and spiritually important field of study.\n\nAbout the Author\nJohn Marmysz holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from State University of New York at Buffalo.
