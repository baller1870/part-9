His quest for the Blameless Amplifier takes readers through the causes of distortion, measurement techniques, and design solutions to minimise distortion and efficiency. The result is a book that is crammed with unique insights into audio design and performance, as well as complete amplifier designs and schematics.\nWhether you are a dedicated audiophile who wants to gain a more complete understanding of the design issues behind a truly great amp, or a professional electronic designer seeking to learn more about the art of amplifier design, Douglas Selfs Handbook is the essential guide to design principles and practice. Self is senior designer with a high-end audio manufacturer, as well as author of numerous magazine articles in the pages of Electronics World / Wireless World. His career in audio design is the foundation of a book that is based solidly on practical experience as well as a dedication to a methodology based on measurement, analysis and scientific design principles.\nThe fourth edition includes new material on DC offset protection circuitry, the design of DC servos and electrical safety and safety standards. In addition, there is a new chapter on Class D power amplifiers.\n\n* The definitive guide to understanding and designing audio amplifiers\n* Includes Douglas Self's classic amp designs for readers to build and adapt\n* A classic work for electronics enthusiasts, Hi-Fi devotees and professional designers alike ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7458b6954c32d785c365961c1297ad484a109670","amp;dn":"Audio+Power+Amplifier+Design+Handbook%2C+4th+Ed++-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7458b6954c32d785c365961c1297ad484a109670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,88,182,149,76,50,215,133,195,101,150,28,18,151,173,72,74,16,150,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
