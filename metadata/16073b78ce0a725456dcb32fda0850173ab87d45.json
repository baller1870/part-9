On March 18, the band posted a promotional video for an upcoming tour with a new song titled &quot;Here to Die&quot;.\nOn May 1, 2013, the band announced that they would be releasing two studio albums in the year, with The Wrong Side of Heaven and the Righteous Side of Hell, Volume 1 being released on July 30, and Volume 2 following on November 19. Guitarist Zoltan Bathory said of the band's decision to release two albums:\n&quot;We came off the road after a couple of great years of touring and were really amped up to write the 4th record. Everybody was in the right headspace and the band tighter than ever so it was a perfect storm. We jumped in head first and found ourselves 12-13 songs deep fairly quick but were still coming up with better and better material so we looked at each other and said... okay why stop there?... letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keep going. Once we passed the 24th song we knew weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to do a double album. We had this massive amount of music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very dear to us, possibly the best material this band has ever created. At that point there was no way to decide which songs to leave off the album. So we made the decision to release them all.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16073b78ce0a725456dcb32fda0850173ab87d45","amp;dn":"Five+Finger+Death+Punch+-+The+Wrong+Side+Of+Heaven+And+The+Right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16073b78ce0a725456dcb32fda0850173ab87d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,7,59,120,206,10,114,84,86,220,179,47,218,8,80,23,58,184,125,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
