At its most harmless, it is annoying. At its worst, it is deadly, on a massive scale.  The Cool are the termites of life, infiltrating every nook and cranny and destroying it from within. The Cool report the news, write the scripts, teach our children, run our governmentÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶and each day they pass judgment on those who donÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t worship at the altar of their coolness.  The cool fawn over terrorists, mock the military, and denigrate employers. They are, in short, awful people. \n\nFrom what we wear and what we eat, to what we smoke and who we poke, pop culture is crafted and manipulated by the cool and, to Greg Gutfeld, that's Not Cool. \n\nHow do the cool enslave you? By convincing you that: \n- If you don't agree with them no one will like you. \n- If you don't follow them you will miss out on life. \n- If you don't listen to them you will die a lonely loser\n\nHow do you vanquish the cool and discover your own true self? Read this book. \n \nIn  Not Cool,  Greg Gutfeld, bestselling author of The Joy Of Hate, lays out the battle plan for reclaiming the real American ideal of cool--building businesses, protecting freedom at home and abroad, taking responsibility for your actions, and leaving other people alone to live as they damn well please.  Not Cool fights back against the culture of phonies, elitists, and creeps who want your soul. It's not a book, it's a weapon - and one should be armed with it at all times.\n\nTHIS IS THE PROPER VERSION!! Sorry about the previous upload of this. Will reupload a fixed version of the audiobook as well.
