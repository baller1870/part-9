The group was founded in 1965 by members Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones, and Jimmy Winston (replaced by Ian McLagan). They are also sometimes referred to as The Small Faces.\nThey are best remembered as possibly one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s, with hit songs such as &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, &quot;Lazy Sunday&quot;, &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, Tin Soldier and their number one concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. They later evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic acts before disbanding in 1969. After the Small Faces disbanded, three of the members were joined by Ronnie Wood (guitar) and Rod Stewart (lead vocals), both from The Jeff Beck Group, and the new line-up was renamed the Faces. They are also widely acknowledged as being one of the biggest original influences on the Britpop movement of the 1990s. Despite the fact they were together just four years, the Small Faces' music output from the mid to late sixties remains among the most acclaimed British mod and psychedelic music of that era. Allmusic refers to them as &quot;The best English band never to make it big in America.&quot;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
