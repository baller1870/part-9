The book now covers new aspects such as recombinant DNA techniques in the improvement of industrial micro-organisms, and includes comprehensive information on fermentation media, sterilization procedures, inocula, and fermenter design. Chapters on effluent treatment and fermentation economics are also incorporated. The text is supported by numerous clear, informative diagrams.\nThe book is of great interest to final year and post-graduate students of applied biology, biotechnology, microbiology, biochemical and chemical engineering.\n\nCONTENTS\n1.
