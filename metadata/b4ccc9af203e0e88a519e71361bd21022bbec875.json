In this new frontier, a rogue gun-slinger and his companion wander across a wilderness in the grips of a civil war, encountering lawlessness, natives, and perversions of civilization in a world at the crossroads between the past and the future. The fact that said gun-slinger is a bio-surgically modified Silverback gorilla toting a pair of enormous revolvers is neither here nor there.\n\nWritten by Simon Spurrier (X-Men Legacy, Extermintation) and drawn by Jeff Stokely (Fraggle Rock).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ccc9af203e0e88a519e71361bd21022bbec875","amp;dn":"Six-Gun+Gorilla+%2801+-+06%29+%28complete%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ccc9af203e0e88a519e71361bd21022bbec875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,204,201,175,32,62,14,136,165,25,231,19,97,189,33,2,43,190,200,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
