Weber unravels the complexities of international relations by explaining and analyzing each theory which illustrated using the example of a popular film, allowing students to understand and critically engage with the myths and assumptions behind them.\nEditorial Reviews Review\n\n'This innovative, outstanding, and widely used international relations text that uses cinema to address international relations theory is up-dated and improved with a new introduction and additional critical analyses of films addressing global environmental politics. WeberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s effective examination of academic theories and political myths through the rhetoric at work in popular films makes this one of the very best texts available today for reaching students in contemporary international relations courses.' - Timothy W. Luke, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University USA\n\nPraise for the previous edition:\n\n'I know of nothing that has such an excellent combination of lucidity and both comprehensive and critical coverage.' - Professor Michael Shapiro, University of Hawaii, USA\n\n'Refreshingly original, interesting and fun to read, this book will surely encourage students to think critically about international politics' - Roxanne Lynn Doty, Arizona State University, USA\n\nOffers something that has been missing from the critical IR literature ever since its initial formulations over a decade ago: a breakthrough textbook that will allow a much wider audience of undergraduate students to understand how - and, more importantly, why - critical IR asks the sort of questions it does.' - Peter Mandaville,University of Kent UK\nAbout the Author Cynthia Weber is Professor of International Studies at the University of Lancaster, UK.
