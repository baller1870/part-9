It has been designed as a resource for new professionals, including graduate students in mental health, as well as more seasoned clinicians planning to integrate group psychotherapy into their work.\n\nBringing together pre-eminent group psychotherapists from different theoretical perspectives and countries, the articles in this volume present their approaches to conducting groups with diverse populations in different settings. Written in straight-forward, jargon-free language, the articles directly speak to the needs of the mental health professional planning to begin a group or to strengthen an existing group. Whether combined with a formal class in group techniques, human relations, or group dynamics, or in an institute training group practitioners, or read as part of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own professional development, this work is likely to advance the reader's clinical competency and strengthen their self-confidence as a leader.\n\nUsing a personal style and speaking from years of experience, the contributors provide hands-on suggestions as to how a group leader really works. From determining patient or client needs, developing treatment goals, and constructing a group, to handling emergencies, the contributors address the needs of the new group leader. The articles also address issues of diversity and globalism, as well as trauma and resiliency, making this a truly post-9/11 contribution. \n\n\nHardcover: 820 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (December 20, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470666315\nISBN-13: 978-0470666319","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81d1936da2188c2d2bb3c00f70fab3deedb51c6","amp;dn":"The+Wiley-Blackwell+Handbook+of+Group+Psychotherapy%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81d1936da2188c2d2bb3c00f70fab3deedb51c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,29,25,54,218,33,136,194,210,187,60,0,247,15,171,61,238,219,81,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
