Purchased by Tony more than 50 years ago, Lyon's Pharmacy of Elkton has been a staple in the tight-night Maryland community, but Tony's daughter Marybeth, a pharmacist by trade, has been struggling to keep it afloat since her father passed away last year. With old, rotted floors and hours needed to restock the pharmacy shelves, Robert needs the full support of the community to pitch in and save a piece of their town's history.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 22-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb92e79dd1732baabb983e382729060da2c201c4","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Impossible.S11E05.Prescription.for.Failure.PDTV.x264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb92e79dd1732baabb983e382729060da2c201c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,146,231,157,209,115,43,170,187,152,62,56,39,41,6,13,162,194,1,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
