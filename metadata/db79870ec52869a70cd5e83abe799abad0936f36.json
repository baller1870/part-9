The children were selected to represent the range of socio-economic backgrounds in Britain at that time, with the explicit assumption that each child's social class predetermines their future. Every seven years, the director, Michael Apted, films new material from as many of the fourteen he can get to participate. The latest film, 49 up, was released in September 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db79870ec52869a70cd5e83abe799abad0936f36","amp;dn":"49+Up+%28Michael+Apted%2C+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db79870ec52869a70cd5e83abe799abad0936f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,121,135,14,197,40,105,167,12,213,232,58,190,121,154,186,208,147,111,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
