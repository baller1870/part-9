Kelly VINE VOICE\n\nMany reviews here seem to think that this is a compliation of either a) greatest hits or b) remixes done at a later date. That simply isn't the case. By the time this disc was released on CD it had already been released as an import vinyl LP 2 years earlier, which I original had, but which did not have &quot;To Be A Lover&quot; on it because the song hadn't been release yet. This compilation was a collection of Billy's 12&quot; mixes. These are all 12&quot; mixes that were released at the time of each song's popularity. Most of these mixes, in fact, were on the 12&quot; single of Dancing with Myself in 1983! Other than that, the remix of Flesh for Fantasy is the remix from the original 12&quot;, which included the LP version as well since this version doesn't have all the vocals. &quot;To Be A Lover&quot;, which was added to this collection in 1987 when it was re-released on CD, is the original vinyl 12&quot; version. The reason songs such as &quot;rebel yell&quot; and &quot;eyes without a face&quot; are not included is because there were no 12&quot; mixes released of these songs. If you want Billy's greatest hits, then by all means, get his greatest hits. If you want these unique 12&quot; mixes that would otherwise be impossible to get in digital quality, forcing you to keep all your old 12&quot; vinyl singles, then don't hesitate to get this disc.\n\nAnd for hardcore fans who might shun this disc because they consider these versions 'inferior', just consider this. White Wedding was CALLED 'part 1' on Billy's LP, so obviously, he actually recorded a part 1 AND 2, which you have here. What's surprising about this however is that there are lyric verses on this version that are not used on the LP mix (makes sense since this is a longer version), BUT there is also a lyric verse on the LP mix that isn't on this long version!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVital Idol\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFLAC:\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3:\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
