Ibert's piano music is a bit reminiscent of Poulenc's but more straightforward. These tiny Pictures, Stories, Encounters, and sundry musical images - some 36 of them before this generous program has run its course - enchant even if they don't cut very deeply. The Romance offers Schumannesque Lyricism; the 'Abandoned Palace' and ' The Wind Over The Ruins' have spooky Gothic atmosphere; the brilliant 'Cabman's Dance' sprints off the keyboard and out of sight; the children's pieces evoke innocence and wonder in the mode of Ravel's Mother Goose.\r\nAs usual, Naxos serves up a fresh, impressive musician along with the novel music. Korean pianist Hae-won Chang plays with crisp rhythms, subtle colors, and a sense of joy. The sound is warm and resplendent. This enterprising label shows that there is no reason for brainless &quot;easy listening&quot;. Plenty of great music with a light touch is out there, waiting to be unearthed.&quot; --Jack Sullivan\r\n\r\nJACQUES IBERT (1890-1962)\r\nPiano Music\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Petite Suite\r\nâ€¢ Histoires\r\nâ€¢ Les rencontres\r\nPlaying Time: 70:47\r\n\r\nHae-won Chang, piano\r\n\r\nRecorded at Tonstudio van Geest in Heidelberg, Germany from 29th to 30th September, 1991\r\nProducer: Teije van Geest\r\nÂ® 1992 HNH International Ltd.\r\nÂ© 2000 HNH International Ltd.\r\nNaxos 8.554720","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686ce8316193973b43727e0f0364b9b2a84a0cec","amp;dn":"Jacques+Ibert%3A+Piano+Music+-+Hae-won+Chang+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686ce8316193973b43727e0f0364b9b2a84a0cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,108,232,49,97,147,151,59,67,114,126,15,3,100,185,178,168,74,12,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
