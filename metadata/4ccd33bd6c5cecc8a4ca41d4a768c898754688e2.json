The band, formed in Houston in 1969, boasts seven platinum and 11 gold records, selling more than 25 million in U.S. album sales alone.\n\nDaryl and Billy launch into a remarkably diverse seven-song set of Daryl Hall and John Oates and ZZ Top chestnuts along with a vintage cover of Hammond B-3 jazz-blues organist Jimmy McGriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1963 instrumental, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kiko.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The pair also perform such deep Daryl Hall tunes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bank on Your Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song from Daryl Hall and John Oates' hit album, Big Bam Boom and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love You Like a Brother,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ recorded in 1973, but unreleased until 1977Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Atlantic Records hits compilation, No Goodbyes. The twosome lean into four ZZ Top nuggets, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cover of Sam &amp; DaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Thank You,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the 1979 album Deguello; the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“La Grange,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ included on 1973Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Tres Hombres; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sharp Dressed ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from 1983Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 10-million-selling Eliminator, and the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of the NightcapsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s rave-up, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thunderbird.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Playing Live from DarylÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House is a regular, down-to-earth, big bash,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Gibbons about the experience. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good groovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the core.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Being in a room with Billy Gibbons is like dipping your toe into the deep wellspring of Texas rock, blues and soul,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Daryl.\n\nNOTE FROM PSoul:\n\nWow, after a year off, Live from DarylÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s House is finally back!\n\nThe good news is that LFDH has been syndicated on over 4 U.S. TV networks which make the show financially viable instead of Daryl paying out of pocket for each episode. The bad news is that VH-1/MTV, has taken over streaming the show online. So, what was once a free show for the entire world to watch is now only available to viewers in the U.S. Thanks VH-1! Bastards.\n\nVH-1 is virtually impossible to rip outside the U.S. (and even it seems in the U.S.) so I had to go Ã¢â‚¬Å“old schoolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and use an anonymous U.S. IP address and Camtasia Studio 8 to record a screen capture.  Hope this will do until someone can provide a proper rip.\n\nYou will notice Paul Pesco, the band leader, is not in this episode. According to his Facebook page has was asked to leave both LFDH and the H&amp;O band. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the circumstances behind this but he will be missed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ccd33bd6c5cecc8a4ca41d4a768c898754688e2","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%27s.House.E63.Billy.Gibbons.SCREEN-CAP.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ccd33bd6c5cecc8a4ca41d4a768c898754688e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,205,51,189,108,92,236,200,164,202,65,212,167,104,200,152,117,70,136,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
