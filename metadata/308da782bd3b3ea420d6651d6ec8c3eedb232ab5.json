Looking to add to the list of great bands from their country is Crimson Wind, a relatively newer band who released their debut The Wings of Salvation in 2011, and are now coming out with their sophomore effort Last Poetry Line.\n\n I found The Wings of Salvation to be an enjoyable but very flawed and uneven release, with its few moments of greatness cancelled out by odd experiments and a couple songs that were just plain dull.\n\n When I heard they were working on a second album, I got my hopes up that they would release a more consistently engaging album this time around. So here is there newest release and you will decide if it is a worthy effort, or do they need something. I just post em you decide if its for you.\n\n\n\nArtist: Crimson Wind\n\nTitle: Last Poetry Line\n\nYear: 2015\n\nGenre: Symphonic Power Metal\n\nOrigin: Italy\n\nSize: 103 mb | Mp3,\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
