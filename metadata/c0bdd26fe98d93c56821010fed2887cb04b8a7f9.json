But even the fact that he is a nephew of the king wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help him clear his name from the unjust charges of murdering his own kin. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to him to prove his innocence, regain the trust of the people of Gladstone, and face the evil, mystical force thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been menacing the land. It will take more than just courage to close the dimensional rifts that seem to be the source of the turmoil. Knowing that, Coppert sets off to find allies, avenge the death of his father and brothers, and save the kingdom itself.\n\nLands of Lore 3 offers diverse, RPG gameplay presented in first person perspective. It gives you a large amount of freedom, letting you choose your own path towards the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate goal, and to divert from it whenever you like to engage in one of the many side-quests. You can join one of four guilds as a fighter, cleric, thief, or mage. Gaining expertise in the skills associated with your class is as easy as putting them into use. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not facing your destiny all by yourself, though. By your side youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a magical familiar, a faithful companion in your journey. With its help you will explore one of the most extensive RPG game worlds ever created.\n\nBonus content: avatars, manual, reference card.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_lol3_2.0.0.8.exe and install the game;\n2) Launch the game using its desktop or start menu shortcuts.\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!\n\nwww.gog.com/gamecard/lands_of_lore_3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bdd26fe98d93c56821010fed2887cb04b8a7f9","amp;dn":"Lands++of++Lore++3++GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bdd26fe98d93c56821010fed2887cb04b8a7f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,189,210,111,233,141,147,197,104,33,1,15,237,40,135,203,4,184,167,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
