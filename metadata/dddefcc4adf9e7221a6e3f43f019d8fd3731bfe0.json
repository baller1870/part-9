Like a true anthology series, the episodes are completely standalone, with no continuing characters (or even themes beyond simple erotica). Each season contains eight episodes.\n\nThe series is unique in one regard: unlike other erotic TV series, Bliss was designed for, and aired on, network TV (and basic cable in America); naughty modesty is the aim of the show, with no content that would be considered pornographic. Created in Canada, the show meets the broadcast standards of Canadian TV, with brief toplessness being shown occasionally; Oprah Winfrey's Oxygen Network aired the show in the US.\n\nThe original broadcast order for season two is as follows:\n\n1. &quot;Three&quot; 14 February 2003 - Guest stars: Jennifer Podemski, Ben Bass, Bob Cryer\n2. &quot;Nina's Muse&quot; 14 February 2003 - Guest stars: Thea Gill, Troy Ruptash\n3. &quot;Cat Got Your Tongue&quot; 21 February 2003 - Guest stars: Wendel Meldrum, Sherry Miller, Gianpaolo Venuta, Mark Taylor\n4. &quot;The Marvellon&quot; 28 February 2003 - Guest stars: Lauren Evans, Lynda Boyd\n5. &quot;Chastity&quot; 7 March 2003 - Guest stars: Cara Pifko, Andrew Tarbet\n6. &quot;Office Management&quot; 14 March 2003 - Guest stars: Rachel Hayward, David Cook\n7. &quot;The Piano Tuner&quot; 21 March 2003 - Guest stars: Shannon Lawson, Alan Van Sprang\n8. &quot;Aural Sex&quot; 28 March 2003 - Guest stars: Danny Gilmore, Raven Dauda\n\n&quot;The Marvellon&quot; is the only episode in season two with lesbian content.\n\nEach episode is encoded as a separate MKV file, with full title episode. Episode number was not placed in the filename, as the Canadian broadcast order, US airing order, and DVD order all differ... and as an anthology series, this is one case where it doesn't matter in which order you watch the show.\n\nSeeding on basic DSL, so this one will take a while to fully seed. Please be patient with me!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dddefcc4adf9e7221a6e3f43f019d8fd3731bfe0","amp;dn":"Bliss%3A+Season+2+%282003%2C+Canadian+TV+anthology%2C+limited+lesbian+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dddefcc4adf9e7221a6e3f43f019d8fd3731bfe0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,222,252,196,173,249,231,34,26,110,63,67,240,25,216,253,55,49,191,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
