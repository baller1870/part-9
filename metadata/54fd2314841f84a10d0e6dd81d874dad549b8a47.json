The Blue Ridge MadamÃ¢â‚¬â€built by WillaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great-great-grandfather during Walls of WaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heyday, and once the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandest homeÃ¢â‚¬â€has stood for years as a lonely monument to misfortune and scandal. And Willa herself has long strived to build a life beyond the brooding Jackson family shadow. No easy task in a town shaped by years of tradition and the well-marked boundaries of the haves and have-nots.\n\nBut Willa has lately learned that an old classmateÃ¢â‚¬â€socialite do-gooder Paxton OsgoodÃ¢â‚¬â€of the very prominent Osgood family, has restored the Blue Ridge Madam to her former glory, with plans to open a top-flight inn. Maybe, at last, the troubled past can be laid to rest while something new and wonderful rises from its ashes. But what rises instead is a skeleton, found buried beneath the propertyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lone peach tree, and certain to drag up dire consequences along with it.\n\nFor the bonesÃ¢â‚¬â€those of charismatic traveling salesman Tucker Devlin, who worked his dark charms on Walls of Water seventy-five years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€are not all that lay hidden out of sight and mind. Long-kept secrets surrounding the troubling remains have also come to light, seemingly heralded by a spate of sudden strange occurrences throughout the town.\n\nNow, thrust together in an unlikely friendship, united by a full-blooded mystery, Willa and Paxton must confront the dangerous passions and tragic betrayals that once bound their familiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and uncover truths of the long-dead that have transcended time and defied the grave to touch the hearts and souls of the living.\n\nResonant with insight into the deep and lasting power of friendship, love, and tradition, The Peach Keeper is a portrait of the unshakable bonds thatÃ¢â‚¬â€in good times and bad, from one generation to the nextÃ¢â‚¬â€endure forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54fd2314841f84a10d0e6dd81d874dad549b8a47","amp;dn":"The+Peach+Keeper+by+Sarah+Addison+Allen+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54fd2314841f84a10d0e6dd81d874dad549b8a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,253,35,20,132,31,132,161,13,14,109,216,29,135,77,173,84,155,138,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
