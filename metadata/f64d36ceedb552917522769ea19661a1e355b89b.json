Vincent Lindon (Denis's Friday Night) stars as Marco, a sea captain gone AWOL to avenge his brother-in-law's suicide and to rescue his estranged sister and his teenaged niece (Lola CrÃƒÂ©ton, Goodbye First Love); Chiara Mastroianni (A Christmas Tale) is Lindon's married lover, who has sold her soul in exchange for the security of her young son; and the remarkable Michel Subor is her husband - a sleazy financier who is the very embodiment of an evil beyond comprehension. Denis takes the viewer into the very heart of darkness in her most unsettling film yet, an unforgettable and thrilling commentary on late capitalism. An official selection at the Cannes and Toronto Film Fesitvals.\n\n\nLanguages: French / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64d36ceedb552917522769ea19661a1e355b89b","amp;dn":"Les+Salauds+aka+Bastards+2013+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64d36ceedb552917522769ea19661a1e355b89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,77,54,206,237,181,82,145,117,34,118,158,161,150,97,161,227,85,184,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
