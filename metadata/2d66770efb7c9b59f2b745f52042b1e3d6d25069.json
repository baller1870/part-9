Thomas Blackthorne claims he can insert a jackhammer down his throat... and then turn it on. Stevie Star claims he can swallow shocking objects, and regurgitate them in any order he chooses. How he does it, it's hard to say, but it's impossible not to watch. Ryan Stock puts a meat hook through his skull and attempts to pull weights that will push human bone strength to the limit.\r\n\r\n2)  Painproof \r\nStan sends Daniel to meet four people who can control their perception of pain, and push their bodies to unthinkable levels. Having created so many fictional pain-proof characters in his comics, Stan never thought real people could possess immunity to pain, but these four individuals perform staggering feats of pain tolerance that challenge the known limits of the human body.\r\n\r\n3)  Human Fireball \r\nThis time Stan wants Daniel to investigate four people who claim to have superhuman heat tolerance, performing potentially deadly demonstrations that push themselves, and the human body, to new limits\r\n\r\n4)  Powerlifting Pastor \r\nSuper-strength appears in almost all comics, whether a natural-born ability or the result of some misguided scientific experiment. This time Daniel investigates four claims of genuine real-life super-strength that appear to take human power to mind boggling levels.\r\n\r\n5)  Fearproof \r\nThis time Stan wants Daniel to meet four people who claim to be fear-proof, and push man's limits to the very edge, performing staggering feats at extreme heights that would paralyze any normal person with fear.\r\n\r\n6)  Rapid Fire \r\nComics are full of inventors and geniuses that use machines to perform amazing feats. Stan sends Daniel to meet real life inventors who claim to have built machines that that merge man and machine. But can they take humans to the next level, to become superhuman?\r\n\r\n7)  Man vs Beast \r\nAnimals are imbued with incredible abilities, like echo-location and super-sight. This time, Stan sends Daniel on a mission to find four people who claim they have the ability to match nature's superpowered animals.\r\n\r\n8)  High Voltage \r\nGenetic mutation produces incredible comic-book superheroes. But Stan wants Daniel to meet four real people who claim to have a difference in their physiology, that makes them superhuman!\r\n\r\n9)  Disc of Death \r\nStan is on the hunt for people with secret abilities that turn them into lethal human weapons! Brodie Smith is rumored to use an every day frisbee with killer accuracy. Daniel puts him head-to-head with a sniper to find out how accurate he really is.\r\n\r\n10)  Ultimate Super Team \r\nCreating teams of comic book heroes requires a combination of incredible but unique superpowers. This time Daniel meets four people with totally separate powers...but could they be ultimate team of real life superhumans?\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d5/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9e/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Stan-Lees-Superhumans-Season-3-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3305 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 384 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 42 mins\r\n * Framerate: 23.976 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 10\r\n * Container mkv\r\n * Part Size: 1.00 GB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.history.com/shows/stan-lees-superhumans/season-3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d66770efb7c9b59f2b745f52042b1e3d6d25069","amp;dn":"Stan+Lees+Superhumans+Series+3+01of10+Throat+of+Steel+720p+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d66770efb7c9b59f2b745f52042b1e3d6d25069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,102,119,14,251,124,155,89,242,183,69,245,32,66,177,227,214,210,80,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
