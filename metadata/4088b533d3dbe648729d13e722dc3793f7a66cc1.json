This new edition has 60% more content, and it remains a comprehensive publication covering most aspects of the topic. The use of microreactors in homogeneous, heterogeneous as well as biphasic reactions is covered in the main part of the book, together with catalytic, bioorganic and automation approaches. The initial chapters also provide a solid physical chemistry background on fluidics in microdevices.\nFinally, a chapter on industrial applications and developments covers recent progress in process chemistry.\nAn excellent reference for beginners and experts alike.\n\nFrom the contents:\nProperties and use of microreactors\nFabrication of microreactors made from metals and ceramic\nMicroreactors made of glass and silicon\nAutomation in microreactor systems\nHomogeneous reactions (including photochemical and electrochemical reactions and radiopharmaceutical synthesis)\nHeterogeneous reactions\nBiphasic reactions (liquid/liquid, liquid/gas)\nBioorganic and biocatalytic reactions\nIndustrial microreactor process development up to production\nAbout the Author\nThomas Wirth is professor of organic chemistry at Cardiff University. After studying chemistry in Bonn and at the Technical University of Berlin, he obtained his PhD in 1992 with Prof. S. Blechert. After a postdoctoral stay with Prof. K. Fuji at Kyoto University a JSPS fellow, he started his independent research at the University of Basel (Switzerland). In the group of Prof. B. Giese he obtained his habilitation on stereoselective oxidation reactions supported by various scholarships before taking up his current position at Cardiff University in 2000. He was invited as a visiting professor to a number of places including the University of Toronto/Canada (1999), Chuo University in Tokyo/Japan (2000), Osaka University/Japan (2004), and Osaka Prefecture University/Japan (2008) and was awarded the Werner-Prize from the New Swiss Chemical Society (2000). His main interests of research concern stereoselective electrophilic reactions, oxidative transformations with hypervalent iodine reagents including mechanistic investigations and organic synthesis performed in microreactors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4088b533d3dbe648729d13e722dc3793f7a66cc1","amp;dn":"Microreactors+in+Organic+Chemistry+and+Catalysis+2E+Wiley+2013+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4088b533d3dbe648729d13e722dc3793f7a66cc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,136,181,51,211,219,230,72,114,157,19,231,34,220,55,147,247,166,108,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
