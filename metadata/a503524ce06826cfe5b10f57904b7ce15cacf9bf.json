Now, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re best friends and partners in the Orange County private investigation firm of Moreno &amp; Hart. But their routine assignments are anything but safe Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCrash Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nScarlet Moreno has her hands full with a cheating spouse case when the bartender at her favorite pub becomes a murder suspect. Worse, the detective in charge of the investigation threatens to arrest Scarlet for obstruction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even when she tries to give him valuable information. Scarlet risks her PI license and her life to find out the truth, absolve her friend, and track down a killer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with or without the help of the arrogant, mysterious Detective Alex Bishop.\n\nAnd Burn Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nKrista Hart is burned out on catching deadbeat dads and philandering husbands when a big-time criminal defense attorney hires her for a choice assignment: find the sole witness to murder the day before the trial. The case could be a boon for Moreno &amp; Hart, but the witness is in hiding, someone is following Krista, and her own client is withholding information. The last person she wants help from is sexy investigator R.J. Flynn, but he claims heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to share intel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for a price. If she can solve this case, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll elevate Moreno &amp; Hart above being divorce voyeurs, but first she has to survive, with her life and heart intact.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a503524ce06826cfe5b10f57904b7ce15cacf9bf","amp;dn":"Crash+and+Burn+-+Allison+Brennan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a503524ce06826cfe5b10f57904b7ce15cacf9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,3,82,76,224,104,38,207,229,177,15,87,144,75,124,225,92,172,249,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
