What if she then tells you that her body is actually in a coma on the other side of town? Should you have her see a psychiatrist or should you consult one yourself? Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?\n\nThis is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment.\n\nArthur is the only man who can share Lauren's secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence. So when doctors prepare to end Lauren's physical care -- which would destroy the magical bond she and Arthur cherish -- he must find a way to save her. For, after all, it is only her love that can save him.\n\n&quot;If Only It Were True&quot; is a heartwarming love story impossible to forget, an adventure that is by turns breathtaking and hilarious -- a captivating tale that evokes the essence of romance and our boundless capacity to believe.\n \n \n** ** Marc Levy*******\noriginally downloaded from torrent hound \n\nplz seed to keep this great book alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e6173863095de2455be391f4170f8df4ceaa6c","amp;dn":"just+like+heaven+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e6173863095de2455be391f4170f8df4ceaa6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,230,23,56,99,9,93,226,69,91,227,145,244,23,15,141,244,206,170,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
