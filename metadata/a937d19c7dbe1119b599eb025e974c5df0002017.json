Link: http://www.calibre-ebook.com/\n\nGenres: Sci-Fi, Horror, Action, Young Adult\n\nSummary:\n\nZom-B is a radical new series about a zombie apocalypse, told in the first person by one of its victims. The series combines classic Shan action with a fiendishly twisting plot and hard-hitting and thought-provoking moral questions dealing with racism, abuse of power and more. This is challenging material, which will captivate existing Shan fans and bring in many new ones. As Darren says, &quot;It's a big, sprawling, vicious tale...a grisly piece of escapism, and a barbed look at the world in which we live. Each book in the series is short, fast-paced and bloody. A high body-count is guaranteed!&quot; - Goodreads Summary of Zom-B\n\nNote: Lots of blood, gore, and horror, for an older teen audience.\n\nCompatibility: Most eReaders\n\nCovers: Yes\n\nAny requests?
