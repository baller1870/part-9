Let's be honest. His pneumonia was likely a symptom of the slow suicide he was committing by using drugs while his newfound spirituality is a result of a recovery program that millions before him have done. Glad to see this.....best album ever and proof an artist doesn't have to be drunk or high to create something amazing. - Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nBy Peter R\nTo me, this is the best Spiritualized record since `Ladies and Gentlemen'.\n\nFirst lyric point: I think this is his most lyrically interesting work. Content wise, JP seems to have wallowed in the self-pity of drug addiction. I found his musical glorification of his wretched state a bit annoying. But maybe as a non-drug user, I just couldn't relate. The lyrics on this record seem to be much more honest. Dwelling on death is probably as much of a rock lyric clichÃƒÂ© as the addiction/redemption dichotomy, but I think he explores it with more insight and heart. (As an aside, I've read that most of this record was written prior to his major illness. So I find the fact that he got to this point without the actual brush with death all the more impressive.)\n\nSecond lyrical point: JP's penchant for parodying clichÃƒÂ©s as a basis for lyrics seems to be gone. And I'm glad. Other than `She Kissed Me and It Felt Like a Hit', I found these groan inducing rather than funny or insightful.\n\nMusically: I thought &quot;Let it Come Down&quot; was really overblown and sterile (relative to L&amp;G. It's still sonically a very impressive sound). And I thought &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; was good but a bit too raw and under-produced. But for me, I think this record is the perfect balance of the two sounds. It has great dynamic range in the arrangement and mix/master which is a welcome change these days. The loan acoustic guitar sounds detailed but hushed, and the orchestra sounds massive but with a lot more restraint than LICD.\n\nAnd I really like the Harmony Interludes and how they help pace out the album.\n\nIn summary, I know Jason Pierce hasn't been labouring for the last 10 years trying to make a second great record to please me personally, but I must say, he has succeeded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4bcb482120d2102dcb3a9e31bcd5e13dc92eb4","amp;dn":"Spiritualized+-+Songs+in+A%26amp%3BE+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+British+Dream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4bcb482120d2102dcb3a9e31bcd5e13dc92eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,75,203,72,33,32,210,16,45,203,58,158,49,188,213,225,61,201,46,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
