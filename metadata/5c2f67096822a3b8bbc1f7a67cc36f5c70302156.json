The bride's brother, in a shocking display, exposes the groom's motives during his wedding toast and threatens his new brother-in-law with death if he disappoints his sister. But Nishi is not who we think. He was born the illegitimate son of the man who Kieko's father, Iwabuchi (Maysayuki Mori), manipulated into suicide. Now Nishi wants revenge for his father's death. As Nishi slowly destroys Iwabuchi's life, he makes the fatal error of falling in love with his wife, who already loves him. Their unconsummated marriage stands between these two like a palpable pillar of stone. But just when we think the stone has been tossed aside by love, Iwabuchi finds out who his son-in-law really is.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The.Bad.Sleep.Well.1960.BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-MySiLU.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 6.56 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 30mn\n      Overall bit rate : 6 221 Kbps\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Duration : 2h 30mn\n      Bit rate : 4 587 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 4 712 Kbps\n      Width : 1 268 pixels\n      Height : 504 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.516\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : DTS\n      Codec ID : A_DTS\n      Duration : 2h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 1 510 Kbps\n      Stream size : 1.59 GiB (24%)\n      Language : Japanese\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054460/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJapanese audio; English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2f67096822a3b8bbc1f7a67cc36f5c70302156","amp;dn":"The.Bad.Sleep.Well.1960.Bluray.720p.x264.DTS-MySiLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c2f67096822a3b8bbc1f7a67cc36f5c70302156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,47,103,9,104,34,163,184,187,193,247,166,124,195,111,92,112,48,33,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
