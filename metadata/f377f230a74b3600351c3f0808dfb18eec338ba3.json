The music and many of the solos will be familiar to longtime Armstrong fans, but whether it be &quot;Struttin' with Some Barbecue,&quot; &quot;Basin Street,&quot; or his then-new hit, &quot;Mack the Knife,&quot; the spirit and enthusiasm of this music is irresistible. This is his best live set in the '50s. The CD reissue, a two-CD set, is slightly more complete than the two-fer LP in that it adds a version of Armstrong's theme song, &quot;When It's Sleepy Time Down South,&quot; a closing &quot;Saints&quot; that allows Satch to introduce his band, and a straightforward rendition of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot;\n\n\nTracks:\n(Disc 1)\n1.
