'Group B' machines had taken the world by storm. De-regulation opened the way for the most exciting cars ever to hit the motorsport scene. Nothing like it has ever happened since. 'This is the fastest rallying there has ever been' - Peter Foubister.\n\nFor four wild and crazy years manufacturers scrambled to build ever more powerful cars to be driven by fearless mavericks who could handle the extreme power. The sport was heading out of control and the unregulated mayhem ended abruptly in 1986 after a series of horrific tragedies. This is the story of when fans, ambition, politics and cars collided. \n\n'The fans were crazy. As the cars sped by the spectators ran into the road!' - Ari Vatanen\n\n'They were playing with their lives'.\n\n'To go rallying is madness. This was refined madness' - John Davenport\n\nFeaturing world champaions Ari Vatanen, Walter Rohrl, Stig Blomqvist, plus Michel Mouton, Cesar Fiorio, Jean Todt and many many more.\n\nMadness On Wheels - Rallying's Craziest Years\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 58mn 58s\nBit rate                                 : 1 541 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 58mn 58s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 107 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d637c69ac0eb1c167a9e9804c3eeb127af26a9f","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Madness+On+Wheels+-+Rallying%27s+Craziest+Years+-+TVrip+-+Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d637c69ac0eb1c167a9e9804c3eeb127af26a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,99,124,105,172,14,177,193,103,169,233,128,76,62,235,18,122,242,106,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
