Barr and Jerry Bingham, published in 1987 by DC Comics. \nIt was initially considered to be a retroactive Elseworlds story due to several criticisms, most notably concerning the characters, until Grant Morrison followed up the events of the story in the 4-issue story &quot;Batman &amp; Son&quot; in 2006.\n\nThe story centers on the eco-terrorist and head of the League of Assassins, Ra's al Ghul aiding Batman in his quest to solve the murder of one of Gotham City's most prominent scientists and Batman's romance with Ra's Al Ghul's daughter and heir-apparent, Talia. \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02440e2c631ee092a9a5f101560a48134388f1d9","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Son+of+the+Demon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02440e2c631ee092a9a5f101560a48134388f1d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,68,14,44,99,30,224,146,169,165,241,1,86,10,72,19,67,136,241,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
