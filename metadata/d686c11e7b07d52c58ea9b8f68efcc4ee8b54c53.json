An accomplished singer with a genuine feel for the music, Richard's artistic legacy is nonetheless meager, as he was quickly steered toward a middle-of-the-road pop direction. Several of his late-'50s recordings, however, were genuinely exciting Presley-esque rockers -- especially his first hit, &quot;Move It&quot; (1958) -- and gave British teenagers their first taste of genuine homegrown rock &amp; roll talent. Backed by the Shadows -- clean-cut instrumental virtuosos who became legends of their own -- Richard embarked on a truly awesome string of hit singles in Britain, scoring no less than 43 Top 20 hits between 1958 and 1969. One of these, although it was by no means one of the more successful, was an actual Mick Jagger/Keith Richards composition (the ballad &quot;Blue Turns to Grey&quot;).\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-richard-p5265/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nPage located at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-cliff-sings-r913074&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-cliff-sings-r913074&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nCliff\nAMG Review by Dave Thompson\n\nWith close to 50 years of hit-making behind him, it seems difficult today to believe there was ever a time when Cliff Richard was not a permanent fixture on the U.K. charts; when the Oldest Teenager In Pop was himself a fresh-faced teen, still trying to accustom himself to his overnight transition from a skiffle singer named Harry Webb to Britain's Elvis Presley, of course, but more importantly than that, the only viable rock &amp; roll star the country had produced in three years of trying. ....\n\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-r1796048/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-r1796048/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nCliff Sings\nAMG Review by Dave Thompson\n\nProducer Norrie Paramor knew exactly what he was doing. Cliff Richard burst onto the British pop scene with a rocker -- his first album, accordingly, rocked just as hard. But when he scored his first number one with a ballad, it only followed that album number two would follow suit. Cliff Sings is almost unrecognizable as the successor to the hottest live recording of the late '50s. True, the two sides of the original vinyl open with blistering intent -- a vicious &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;; a sneering rockabilly &quot;Twenty Flight Rock.&quot; But the heart of the album lies in the biggest ballads, the warmest strings, the most dramatic arrangements -- all the things, in fact, for which the veteran Paramor had been renowned before he was nipped by the rock &amp; roll bug. It was not a complete disenfranchisement. A second Carl Perkins song, &quot;Pointed Toe Shoes,&quot; a fluid &quot;Mean Woman Blues,&quot; and the furious &quot;The Snake and the Bookworm&quot; rocked at least as hard as past 45s &quot;Dynamite&quot; and &quot;High Class Baby.&quot; And when the last dance loomed at the youth club, George Gershwin's &quot;Embraceable You&quot; was always going to get a lot more couples smooching than some raucous one-two-three o'clock rocker. ....\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-sings-r488973/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cliff-sings-r488973/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MCX8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MCX8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
