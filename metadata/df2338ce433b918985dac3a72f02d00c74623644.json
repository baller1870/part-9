After years of decline in the post-war period much of the network was eventually restored. Once places of labour and industry, they became places of leisure and tranquillity. The newly renovated canals were increasingly popular for boating holiday makers. Liz visits the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales and travels to Birmingham where canals have become catalysts for property development and urban regeneration. Canals offer so many benefits today. Perhaps, Liz suggests, it is time to construct a few more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen0.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a6/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/66/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cd/Canals-The-Making-of-a-Nation-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3073 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 657 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0689qmh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2338ce433b918985dac3a72f02d00c74623644","amp;dn":"Canals.The.Making.Of.A.Nation.6of6.Heritage.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2338ce433b918985dac3a72f02d00c74623644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,35,56,206,67,59,145,137,133,218,195,167,47,2,208,12,116,98,54,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
