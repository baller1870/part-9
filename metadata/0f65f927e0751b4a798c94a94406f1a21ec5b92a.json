The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s albums include D-Boy, released by the NYNO (New York/New Orleans) label in 1997; New Birth Family, issued by Valley Entertainment in 2005; and New Orleans Second Line!, a 2006 disc on the Mardi Gras Records label.&quot; \n-- http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/new-birth-brass-band/571184\n\n* * *\n\nThe Soul Rebels - No More Parades \nRelease Year:  2005\nRecord Label:  Tuff City Records)\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
