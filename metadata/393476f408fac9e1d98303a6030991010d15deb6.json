He wrote in a wide range of disciplines: moral philosophy, jurisprudence, rhetoric and literature, and the history of science. He was one of the leading figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith also studied the social forces giving rise to competition, trade, and markets. While professor of logic, and later professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow University, he also had the opportunity to travel to France, where he met FranÃƒÂ§ois Quesnay and the physiocrats; he had friends in business and the government, and drew broadly on his observations of life as well as careful statistical work summarizing his findings in tabular form. He is viewed as the founder of modern economic thought, and his work inspires economists to this day. The economic phrase for which he is most famous, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“invisible handÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of economic incentives, was only one of his many contributions to the modern-day teaching of economics.\n\nGlasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence Vol. 1 The Theory of Moral Sentiments\nThe Theory of Moral Sentiments, SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first and in his own mind most important work, outlines his view of proper conduct and the institutions and sentiments that make men virtuous. Here he develops his doctrine of the impartial spectator, whose hypothetical disinterested judgment we must use to distinguish right from wrong in any given situation. We by nature pursue our self-interest, according to Smith. This makes independence or self-command an instinctive good and neutral rules as difficult to craft as they are necessary. But society is not held together merely by neutral rules; it is held together by sympathy. Smith argues that we naturally share the emotions and to a certain extent the physical sensations we witness in others. Sharing the sensations of our fellows, we seek to maximize their pleasures and minimize their pains so that we may share in their joys and enjoy their expressions of affection and approval.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393476f408fac9e1d98303a6030991010d15deb6","amp;dn":"Glasgow+Edition+-+The+Works+%26amp%3B+Correspondence+of+Adam+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393476f408fac9e1d98303a6030991010d15deb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,52,118,244,8,250,201,225,217,131,3,166,3,9,145,1,13,21,222,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
