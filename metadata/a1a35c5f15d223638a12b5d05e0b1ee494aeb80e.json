HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classics into a full house of entertainment that has something for all tastes. The five classics are tied together by John SteinbeckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narration.\n\nThe Cop and the Anthem gets the quintet off to an enjoyable 19-minute start as Charles Laughton milks the fat part of Soapy, the gentleman bum who tries unsuccessfully to get arrested so he can spend the winter months in a warm jail.\n\nThe Clarion Call is a 22-minute excursion into melodrama with a twist. Dale Robertson plays the cop with a conscience who must arrest Richard Widmark, an old pal gone wrong and to whom he owes a debt.\n\nThe Last Leaf plunges into dramatics for 23 minutes, with Anne Baxter, Jean Peters and Gregory Ratoff keeping it emotionally sure. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the tale of a girl, without the will to live because of an unhappy love affair, who believes she will die when the last leaf falls from a vine outside her window.\n\nFred Allen, Oscar Levant and young Lee Aaker keep amusing a highly burlesqued takeoff on The Ransom of Red Chief, the comedy saga of two city slickers who make the mistake of kidnapping for ransom the hellion son of a backwoods Alabama rich farmer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broad fun as directed by Howard Hawks.\n\nPicture closes with a choice little account of that tender story of young love, The Gift of the Magi, splendidly trouped by Jeanne Crain and Farley Granger.\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.36b\nDuration.... 01:52:46\nCodec....
