Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a glass of wine. Timothy Spall surprised with a good Irish accent. Not what we had expected and we enjoyed it very much. A light touch from the director and the best from the cast.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBased on the novella by William Trevor, MY HOUSE IN UMBRIA is set in the sprawling Italian countryside. After a tragic train accident, four survivors find solace in the villa of an English writer, Mrs. Delahunty (Maggie Smith). The other survivors--an American girl (Emmy Clarke), a British general (Ronnie Barker), and a young German (Benno Furmann)--struggle to come to terms with the disaster, as an inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) tries to figure out exactly what happened. Eventually, the young girl&amp;#039;s uncle (Chris Cooper) shows up, bringing the film to a climax.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92aa43617a2248b362a8385e4c411f3c3d28f338","amp;dn":"My+House+In+Umbria+-+Maggie+Smith+-+%282003%29+Dvd+Rip+%5BXvid-ENG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92aa43617a2248b362a8385e4c411f3c3d28f338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,170,67,97,122,34,72,179,98,168,56,94,76,65,31,60,61,40,243,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
