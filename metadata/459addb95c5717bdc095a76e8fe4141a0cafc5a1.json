We ll begin with the basics of telephony: loops, trunks, circuits, analog, the voiceband... fundamentals that are key to understanding of newer technologies and services.\nTo complete the picture, we take a practical journey through different types of equipment. We\\'ll review switches, PBXs, Centrex, multiplexers and routers, as well as ancillary equipment like ACDs, voice mail and interactive voice response (IVR) systems.\nWith this framework in place, we\\'ll review the telecommunications industry and understand the main players and competitors, how Local Exchange Carriers connect to Inter-Exchange Carriers and how CLECs fit into the picture.\n\nContent of DVD 1:\nThe topics in this video course - how the telephone system and industry work, provide the essential foundation on which everything else, including digital communications, data circuits and networking are built. 2 hours 22 minutes of career- and productivity-enhancing training! Many people tell us this is training they wish they\\'d had years ago.\n\nPart 1 Fundamentals of Telephony\n1.03 The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)\n1.05 Analog Circuits\n1.07 What is Sound?\n1.09 The Voiceband\n1.11 Plain Ordinary Telephone Service (POTS)\n1.13 DTMF Address Signaling\n1.15 Signaling System 7 (SS7)\n\nPart 2 Telecom Equipment\n2.03 Telephone Switches\n2.05 PBX vs. Centrex\n2.07 Voice VPNs\n2.09 Call Centers\n\nPart 3 The Telecommunications Industry\n3.03 US Domestic Telcos\n3.05 AT&amp;T and Verizon\n3.07 Canadian Telephone Companies\n3.09 PSTN Switching Centers Before Competition\n3.11 Accessing The Interexchange Carriers\n3.13 Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs)\n\nContent of DVD 2:\nIn this video course, we drill into the technology a bit, to understand the concepts, standards and technologies for actually transmitting voice calls from one place to another.\nWe\\'ll give you a real understanding of what \\&quot;digital\\&quot; actually means, and how it is implemented. We ll explain what a \\&quot;DS0\\&quot; is, and take a practical tour of digital circuits, including T1, T3, SONET and ISDN. At a high level, we\\'ll see how voice, data and video can be integrated.\n\nChapter 1 Digital Communications\n1.03 Why Digital?\n1.05 Analog and Digital: What Do We Really Mean?\n1.07 Continuous Signals, Discrete Signals\n1.09 Voice Digitization (Analog ?
