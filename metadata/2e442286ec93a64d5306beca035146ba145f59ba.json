This stand-alone fantasy interpretation of the popular FATE rules features two detailed settings: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Anglerre, the world featured in the original Starblazer fantasy comics, and \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Lords of the Hither Kingdoms, a brand new setting. \n\nArtwork from the Starblazer comics brings the worlds to life and will inspire Story Tellers to get plotting! \n\nPlayers will be able to start with gritty characters through to epic demi-god like heroes, lead armies, fleets and kingdoms, conduct sieges and build a dynasty. New FATE rules include an elegantly simple system for magic and creature powers, personal campaign goals, epic style abilities, combo manoeuvres, magic artefacts and summoning as well as a detailed character background generator. Two introductory adventures, a fantasy campaign generator and fantasy bestiary will help new players jump straight in to the action! \n\nImagine your patrol ship strafing a fleet of galley's defended by dragons and sorcerors! Legends of Anglerre is fully compatible with the Starblazer Adventures core book, allowing space opera characters to be dropped in to a fantasy campaign.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e442286ec93a64d5306beca035146ba145f59ba","amp;dn":"Legends+of+Anglerre+RPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e442286ec93a64d5306beca035146ba145f59ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,68,34,134,236,147,166,77,83,6,190,202,3,81,70,186,20,95,89,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
