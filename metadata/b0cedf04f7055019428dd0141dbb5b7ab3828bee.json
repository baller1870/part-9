In Lion in the White House: A Life of Theodore Roosevelt, historian Aida Donald masterfully chronicles the life of this first modern president. TRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accomplishments in office were immense. As President, Roosevelt redesigned the office of Chief Executive and the workings of the Republican Party to meet the challenges of the new industrial economy. Believing that the emerging aristocracy of wealth represented a genuine threat to democracy, TR broke trusts to curb the rapacity of big business. He improved economic and social conditions for the average American. Roosevelt built the Panama Canal and engaged the country in world affairs, putting a temporary end to American isolationism. And he won the Nobel Peace Prize-the only sitting president ever so honored. Throughout his public career, TR fought valiantly to steer the GOP back to its noblest ideals as embodied by Abraham Lincoln. Alas, his hopes for his party were quashed by the GOPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strong rightward turn in the years after he left office. But his vision for America lives on. In lapidary prose, this concise biography recounts the courageous life of one of the greatest leaders our nation has ever known.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 304 pages\n# Publisher: Basic Books (October 22, 2007)\n# ISBN-10: 1606710362\n# ISBN-13: 978-1606710364\n# ASIN: B001GCVFL4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cedf04f7055019428dd0141dbb5b7ab3828bee","amp;dn":"Lion+in+the+White+House%3A+A+Life+of+Theodore+Roosevelt+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cedf04f7055019428dd0141dbb5b7ab3828bee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,206,223,4,247,5,80,25,66,141,208,20,29,187,91,122,179,130,139,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
