Alongside his oldest friend and brilliant colleague, Augustus Garret, he and his forces saved Earth from invasion by the robotic legions of the First Imperium's insane computer Regent. There is just one problem. The First Imperium was held back by the disruption of the sole warp gate connecting the two domains...and Compton and 300 of his ships are trapped on the wrong side, surrounded by the Regent's vast fleets and cut off from Earth.\r\n\r\nPursued by their deadly enemy, Compton and his fleet must flee into the darkness of unexplored space, seeking safety...and ultimately a new home. Their journey will take them deep into the heart of the First Imperium, to the silent, windswept worlds where the ancient race that built the Regent once dwelled...and uncover the lost secrets of its disappearance 500,000 years ago. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Jay Snyder\r\nLength: 10 hrs and 21 mins\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps \r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:09-15-15\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f3abaeaeaf3eb0eb6ef4dba1d09140c2aee888","amp;dn":"Jay+Allan+-+Into+the+Darkness+%28Crimson+Worlds+Refugees+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f3abaeaeaf3eb0eb6ef4dba1d09140c2aee888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,243,171,174,174,175,62,176,235,110,244,219,161,208,145,64,194,174,232,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
