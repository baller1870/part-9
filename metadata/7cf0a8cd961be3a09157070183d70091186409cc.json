Do More Great Work will not only help you identify what the Great Work of your life is, it will tell you how to do it.................\n\nYou work hard. You put in the hours. Yet you feel like you are constantly treading water with &quot;Good Work&quot; that keeps you going but never quite moves you ahead. Or worse, you are mired in &quot;Bad Work&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€endless meetings and energy-draining bureaucratic traps.\n\nDo More Great Work gets to the heart of the problem: Even the best performers are spending less than a fraction of their time doing &quot;Great Work&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€the kind of innovative work that pushes us forward, stretches our creativity, and truly satisfies us. Michael Bungay Stanier, Canadian Coach of the Year in 2006, is a business consultant whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found a way to move us away from bad work (and even good work), and toward more time spent doing great work.\n\nWhen youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re up to your eyeballs answering e-mail, returning phone calls, attending meetings and scrambling to get that project done, you can turn to this inspirational, motivating, and at times playful book for invaluable guidance. In fifteen exercises, Do More Great Work shows how you can finally do more of the work that engages and challenges you, that has a real impact, that plays to your strengthsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that matters.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/0701/cef34c4.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf0a8cd961be3a09157070183d70091186409cc","amp;dn":"Do+More+Great+Work%3A+Stop+the+Busywork.+Start+the+Work+That+Matte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cf0a8cd961be3a09157070183d70091186409cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,240,168,205,150,27,227,160,145,87,7,1,131,215,0,145,24,100,9,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
