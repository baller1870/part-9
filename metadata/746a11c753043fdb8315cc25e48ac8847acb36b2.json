With comic sub-plots to be found among Henry's soldiers, the production boasts some terrific performances - including Sam Cox as the 'splendidly unhinged' Pistol (The Daily Telegraph). In the title role is Jamie Parker, who 'casts such a rapt spell that you feel the entire audience would rise up to march behind him' (The Independent)....&quot;\n\nMy Notes\n\n   The cycle of Henry plays concludes fittingly with Jamie Parker once again playing Henry.  For those new to these torrent file shares Jamie Parker plays Prince Hal in Henry IV Part and Two with Roger Allam as Falstaff.  To appreciate Parker's range a viewing of these earlier films as well as his roles in other of the Globe on Screen series such as As You Like it give the full sense of his range as a Shakespearean actor.\n\n   The encode of Henry V is done to emphasize voice for home viewing.  I found this necessary to do for my own use.  And these torrent releases should not be considered replacements for the original dvd sets.  These torrents are for those who do not have access to the Globe plays in other ways.  With this is mind. I encourage all viewers to request that your libraries get the dvd sets which have many extras for the enjoyment of all.\nPlease consider adding one of torrents to your permanent seeds.\n\nNotes written March 8th 2014\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:746a11c753043fdb8315cc25e48ac8847acb36b2","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Henry+V+%282012%29+from+Opus+Arte+Prod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"746a11c753043fdb8315cc25e48ac8847acb36b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,106,17,199,83,4,63,219,131,21,204,37,228,138,200,132,122,203,54,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
