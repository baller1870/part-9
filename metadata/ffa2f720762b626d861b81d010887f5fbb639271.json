Rottman\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nTwo of World War IIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most distinctive weapons, the Panzerfaust and Panzerschreck offered German and other infantrymen the ability to destroy enemy tanks singlehandedly at close ranges. While the Panzerschreck owed its origins largely to the US bazooka, the Panzerfaust was a revolutionary design that was unlike any previous weapon, and went on to influence anti-tank technology and tactics for decades after World War II. Allied troops, notably Soviet forces, made widespread use of captured Panzerfauste, and they were also supplied to German allies such as Finland, Hungary and Bulgaria. Written by an expert on anti-tank warfare, this book reveals the fascinating development history of these two feared weapons and assesses the tactics that were employed by the soldiers using them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa2f720762b626d861b81d010887f5fbb639271","amp;dn":"Panzerfaust+and+Panzerschreck+%28WPN+36%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa2f720762b626d861b81d010887f5fbb639271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,162,247,32,118,43,98,109,134,27,129,208,16,136,127,95,187,99,146,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
