You \n\ncan explore more than 40 levels of the game, destroying more enemies than you can \n\nshake a stick at.\n\nThe mirth and mania that comes from a gun-toting man named Sam begin again in the \n\nsequel to the original Serious Sam and it's expansion, Second Encounter. The game \n\nstill has the wild, structure-unconcerned nature that made the first two games \n\nsuch a pick-up-and-play blast, but this edition pumps up the visuals and physics \n\nby incredible degrees with a brand new graphics engine, as well as integrates all-\n\nnew gameplay elements for Sam to cause mayhem. The sequel allows Sam to drive \n\nvehicles, and the co-op mode returns for multiple players to cause even more of a \n\nruckus in the game's open and enemy-filled environments.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4ab948a783541eb9ac207d9e670c91e6e59be8a","amp;dn":"Serious+Sam+II+Pc+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4ab948a783541eb9ac207d9e670c91e6e59be8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,171,148,138,120,53,65,235,154,194,7,217,230,112,201,30,110,89,190,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
