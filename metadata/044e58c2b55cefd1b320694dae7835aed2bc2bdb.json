Future Minds illustrates how to maximize the potential of digital technology and minimize its greatest downside, addressing the future of thinking and how we can ensure that we unleash the extraordinary potential of the human mind.\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:044e58c2b55cefd1b320694dae7835aed2bc2bdb","amp;dn":"Future+Minds%3A+How+the+Digital+Age+is+Changing+Our+Minds%2C+Why+thi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"044e58c2b55cefd1b320694dae7835aed2bc2bdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,78,88,194,181,92,239,209,179,32,105,77,174,120,53,174,210,188,43,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
