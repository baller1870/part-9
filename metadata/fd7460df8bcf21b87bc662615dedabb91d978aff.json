The album was a landmark for AC/DC and included their first ever radio hit (in the U.S.) in &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;. The album is a hard rock lover's dream, with big power chords, lead breaks and powerful vocals. The songs that standout on this release (which make up for more than half the album) are the title track &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;, &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Shot Down In Flames&quot;, &quot;Get It Hot&quot;, &quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It)&quot;, &quot;Walk All Over You&quot;, and &quot;Touch Too Much&quot;. This newly remastered cd which is now under the Epic label sounds much better than the older 1994 remastered version. The bottom end, mid-range and output level have all been increased dramatically. I've actually compared them and found this new release to be the superior of the two. The digipak that holds the cd is very attractive and includes a booklet with colorful photos, etc. If you enjoy groups such as Judas Priest, UFO, Def Leppard, Krokus, Scorpions, etc. than you'll won't be disappointed with &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;. \n\nby Highway_Star\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Highway To Hell.wma                                         \n02 - Girls Got Rhythm.wma                                        \n03 - Walk All Over You.wma                                       \n04 - Touch Too Much.wma                                          \n05 - Beating Around The Bush.wma                                 \n06 - Shot Down In Flames.wma                                     \n07 - Get It Hot.wma                                              \n08 - If You Want Blood (You've Got It).wma                       \n09 - Love Hungry Man.wma                                         \n10 - Night Prowler.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd7460df8bcf21b87bc662615dedabb91d978aff","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Highway+To+Hell+%281979%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd7460df8bcf21b87bc662615dedabb91d978aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,116,96,223,139,207,33,184,123,198,98,97,93,237,171,185,29,151,138,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
