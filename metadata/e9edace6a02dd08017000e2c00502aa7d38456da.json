Mireille Darc plays the central character, an &quot;average&quot; woman who is systematically radicalized during a weekend motor trip. No sooner have the woman and her husband (Jean Yanne) embarked on their journey than they become enmeshed in the mother of all traffic jams. The motorists rave, rant, burn, rape, murder, pillage and even descend into cannibalism -- all of which is treated by Godard as a natural progression of events. The prevalent theory that Jean-Luc Godard had intended Weekend as the apotheosis of his career is bolstered by the film's last two titles: &quot;End of Film.&quot; &quot;End of Cinema.&quot; ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi\n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC  * HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9edace6a02dd08017000e2c00502aa7d38456da","amp;dn":"Weekend+%5BENG+SUB%5D+%281967%29+720p+BrRip+x264+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9edace6a02dd08017000e2c00502aa7d38456da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,237,172,230,160,45,208,128,23,0,14,44,0,80,42,167,211,132,86,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
