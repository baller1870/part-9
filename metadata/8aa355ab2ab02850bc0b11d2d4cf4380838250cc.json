DiskWarrior is not a disk repair program in the conventional sense. Instead of patching the original directory, it uses a patent-pending technology to quickly build a new replacement directory using data recovered from the original directory, thereby recovering files, folders and documents that you thought were lost and that no other program could recover.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s new in this version:\n\nnow available for complete compatibility with Mac OS X 10.5.5 (Leopard). Version 4.1.1 restores the ability to use DiskWarrior to repair permissions while started from Mac OS X 10.5.5.\n\nOperating System Requirements:\n\nThis product is designed to run on the following operating systems:\nMac OS X 10.5 Intel\nMac OS X 10.5 PPC\nMac OS X 10.4 Intel\nMac OS X 10.4 PPC\nMac OS X 10.3.9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa355ab2ab02850bc0b11d2d4cf4380838250cc","amp;dn":"DiskWarrior+4.1.1+%28with+s%2Fn%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa355ab2ab02850bc0b11d2d4cf4380838250cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,163,85,171,42,176,40,80,188,11,17,210,212,207,67,128,131,130,80,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
