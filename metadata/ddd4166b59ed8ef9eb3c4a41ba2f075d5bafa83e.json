Yet amidst these valiant, desperate people, hope remains. A royal house endures unbroken from father to son.\n\nThis 70 minute original drama is set in the time before the War of the Ring and tells the story of the DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnedain, the Rangers of the North, before the return of the King. Inspired by only a couple of paragraphs written by Tolkien in the appendices of the Lord of the Rings we follow Arathorn and Gilraen, the parents of Aragorn, from their first meeting through a turbulent time in their people's history.\n\nScreenshot: http://bayimg.com/image/iaiiiaaca.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddd4166b59ed8ef9eb3c4a41ba2f075d5bafa83e","amp;dn":"Born+of+Hope+-+%5B2009%5D+-+H264+-+1280x720","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddd4166b59ed8ef9eb3c4a41ba2f075d5bafa83e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,212,22,107,89,237,142,249,235,60,74,65,186,47,7,93,91,175,168,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
