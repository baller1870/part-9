D. | ISBN: NA | edition 2008 | PDF | 189 pages\n\nThis book, Basics of Fluid Mechanics, describes the fundamentals of fluid mechanics phenomena for engineers and others. This book is designed to replace all introductory textbook(s) or instructorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s notes for the fluid mechanics in undergraduate classes for engineering/science students but also for technical peoples. It is hoped that the book could be used as a reference book for people who have at least some basics knowledge of science areas such as calculus, physics, etc.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba37d3846b890914972de9ecb13eeb7d11fc4249","amp;dn":"Basics+of+Fluid+Mechanics+%282008%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba37d3846b890914972de9ecb13eeb7d11fc4249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,55,211,132,107,137,9,20,151,45,233,236,177,62,235,125,17,252,66,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
