The story is quite simple but very rich in well-defined details based in an excellent cinematography (Christopher Doyle &amp; Ping Bin Lee), a beautiful score (Mike Gallaso) and a magnificent direction, that all together make the whole movie an unforgettable experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0d14923ef8993d9c39155c8bd1975ceb31a22e","amp;dn":"In+The+Mood+For+Love+%28Fa+yeung+nin+wa%29+-+Kar+Wai+Wong+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0d14923ef8993d9c39155c8bd1975ceb31a22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,13,20,146,62,248,153,61,156,57,21,92,139,209,151,92,235,49,162,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
