The trip dredges up forgotten memories, the first stirrings of childish romance, puberty and growing up, the frustration of math and boys. In lyrical switches between the present and the past, Taeko wonders if she has been true to the dreams of her childhood self.\n\nBeautifully evoking both the 1960's and 1980's. Only Yesterday is a double period piece, and the quintessential drama of Japanese school day nostalgia. Directed by Isao Takahata and produced by Hayao Miyazaki, it is a classic of the anime medium and the last movie from the world-beating Studio Ghibli catalog previously unreleased in the United Kingdom... until now.\n\nIf you like it leave me a little comment and let others know what you think, thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:032d0b0da71073a9478e87871483d76b8303d781","amp;dn":"Only+Yesterday+Studio+Ghibli+Japanese+Audio+Eng+subs+Divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"032d0b0da71073a9478e87871483d76b8303d781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,45,11,13,167,16,115,169,71,142,135,135,20,131,215,107,131,3,215,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
