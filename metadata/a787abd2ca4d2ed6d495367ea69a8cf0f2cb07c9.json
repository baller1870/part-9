Their particular musical influences were Gypsy music, Punk rock, Algerian rai, Mediterranean and South American music and French cafe music.\n\nTheir tracks often feature acoustic guitar and accordion, as well as some tracks containing many other 'traditional' instruments such as piano and brass. Their style is fairly upbeat and energetic on the majority of their tracks, with unusual rhythms, vocals delivered with a generous dose of zeal and vibrant energy, and accompaniment melodies ranging from lilting and distant to eccentric and fast-paced. These two factors give many of their pieces a strong sense of direction.\n\n\nFormed in 1987, Les Negresses Vertes arose from the alternative music scene in Paris. The original line-up included singer Helno (born Noel Rota in Paris, December 25, 1963 - January 22, 1993, also known as Helno Rota de Lourcqua), Jo Roz (also known as l'Ami Ro; real name Joe Ruffier des Aimes) (piano), Stefane Mellino (guitar), Jean-Marie Paulus (bass), Gaby (drums), Matthias Canavese (accordion), Michel Ochowiak (trumpet), Abraham Sirinix (also known as Abraham Braham) (trombone) and Iza Mellino (backing vocals).\n\nThe original members were a group of friends, many of whom had not played their instruments before forming the band. The group's name translates as &quot;green black women&quot;; it arose from abuse hurled at them at one of their first concerts. They were initially signed to the independent Off The Track label, and released the punk protest song &quot;200 Ans D'Hypocrisie&quot; in response to their country's French Revolution bicentennial celebrations.\n\nIn 1989 they released their first album, Mlah, to good reviews in both France and the UK, where the single &quot;Zobi La Mouche&quot; just failed to reach the charts and where they toured and played the WOMAD festival. They also made a controversial tour of Lebanon. Their second album, Famille Nombreuse, in 1991, featured new drummer ZÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Verbalito.\n\nHelno was by this time struggling with serious heroin addiction, and Stefane Mellino and Canavese replaced him as the main songwriters. Helno died at his parents' house on January 22, 1993.\n\nSeveral members left the band after Helno's death, but Les Negresses Vertes continued around the nucleus of Mellino, Canavese, Ochowiak and Paulus. In 1995 they released the album Zig-Zague, followed by the live album Green Bus. By 2000's Trabendo, the group's style had shifted to a dub-orientated lounge style.\n\n\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
