It is a manifesto detailing how to achieve their Cradle to Cradle Design model. It calls for a radical change in industry: a switch from a cradle-to-grave pattern to a cradle-to-cradle pattern. It suggests that the &quot;reduce reuse recycle&quot; methods perpetuate this cradle-to-grave strategy, and that more changes need to be made.
