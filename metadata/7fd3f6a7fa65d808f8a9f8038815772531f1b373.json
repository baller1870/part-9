On this worthy set, he is joined by the McCoy Tyner Trio (which consists of the masterful pianist, bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Louis Hayes) for mostly modern material. Tyner contributed three originals, including &quot;Frank's Back,&quot; and the quartet also digs into &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean,&quot; &quot;Emily,&quot; &quot;All the Things You Are,&quot; &quot;So What&quot; and even &quot;Theme from Love Story.&quot; Morgan's lyricism works quite well with Tyner's powerful chords, and the results are consistently memorable.\n_________________\n\nNot my rip, but not widely available. I've cleaned it up a bit (ID Tags, etc.) but the FLAC files are untouched. Note that Audiochecker reports Track 5 as an MPEG.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd3f6a7fa65d808f8a9f8038815772531f1b373","amp;dn":"Frank+Morgan+-+Major+Changes+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd3f6a7fa65d808f8a9f8038815772531f1b373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,211,246,167,250,101,216,8,248,169,248,3,136,21,119,37,49,241,179,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
