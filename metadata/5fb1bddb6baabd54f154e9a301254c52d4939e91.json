This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at Yoast to improve your site's SEO on all needed aspects. While this WordPress SEO plugin goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content. WordPress SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you're writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n1. Upload the wordress-seo folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory\n2. Activate the WordPress SEO plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\n3. Configure the plugin by going to the SEO menu that appears in your admin menu\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb1bddb6baabd54f154e9a301254c52d4939e91","amp;dn":"Wordpress+plugin+-+WordPress+SEO+by+Yoast+-+Jan+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb1bddb6baabd54f154e9a301254c52d4939e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,177,189,219,107,170,189,84,241,84,233,163,1,37,76,82,212,147,158,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
