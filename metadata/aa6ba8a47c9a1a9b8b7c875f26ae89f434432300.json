What begins as a highly charged first encounter soon becomes something much more, and a relationship quickly develops. As the two men start building a home and life together, each continues to privately battle their own compulsions and addictions. A film about sex, friendship, intimacy and most of all, love, Keep the Lights On takes an honest look at the nature of relationships in our times.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa6ba8a47c9a1a9b8b7c875f26ae89f434432300","amp;dn":"2012+Keep+The+Lights+On+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa6ba8a47c9a1a9b8b7c875f26ae89f434432300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,107,168,164,124,154,26,155,139,124,135,95,38,174,137,244,52,67,35,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
