He called it a third piece in a trilogy about growing up. He also stated the album was about the end of the war he had within himself fighting depression and anxiety. The title is taken from the term coined by Tom Brokaw about how the generation that fought in World War II was 'the greatest generation'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fea19bb1a8aa3494fcbd051c66f9ce0d44b11e1","amp;dn":"The+Wonder+Years+-+The+Greatest+Generation+%28Scene+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fea19bb1a8aa3494fcbd051c66f9ce0d44b11e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,234,25,187,26,138,163,73,79,203,208,81,198,111,156,224,212,75,17,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
