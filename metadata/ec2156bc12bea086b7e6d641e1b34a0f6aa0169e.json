Also, SIBLY was easier from the DVD \r\nwith MMH already combined. The video fill for Heartbreaker was used \r\nbecause it was available and the band loved to tour but hated to leave \r\ntheir families. At the end of the WLL I edited out the double scene of \r\nthe conclusion with the smoke bombs going off. My main goal was to \r\nprovide the proper track list in order of the MSG experience. It was \r\nnamed Fan Edition - a nick from the Collectors Edition Box Set. \r\nI was going to make some art work ripping off the cover of the black \r\nbox set, substituting Collectors with Fan, but artwork is a pain in \r\nthe ass, same with menus. As usual the menus took more time than the \r\nactual concert to compile. Celebration Day was a bitch to combine with \r\nBring It On Home. If you listen carefully, you can hear the transition \r\nfrom TSRTS to DVD.\r\n\r\nThe DVD PCM audio is some of the best Led Zeppelin released by the \r\nband, especially the Knebworth, they were light years ahead of any \r\nband at the time.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: \r\nBy downloading these files, you are representing that you have \r\npurchased the official releases. This is not about ripping off \r\nthe band and their work -- this is by a fan, for the fans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2156bc12bea086b7e6d641e1b34a0f6aa0169e","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Song+Remain+The+Same+Fan+Edition+Region+Free+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2156bc12bea086b7e6d641e1b34a0f6aa0169e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,33,86,188,18,190,160,134,183,230,214,65,225,179,74,15,106,160,22,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
