The aim of this book is to provide the model railway enthusiast with a number of useful bur reasonably simple projects that are easily constructed from readily available components\nStripboard layouts and wiring diagrams are provided for each project. The projects covered include: constant voltage controller, pulsed controller, pushbutton pulsed controller; pulsed controller with simulated inertia, momentum and braking; automatic signals; steam whistle sound effect; two-tone horn sound effect; automatic two-tone horn effect automatic chuffer. The final chapter covers the increasingly popular subject of using a computer to control a model railway layout, including circuits for computer based controllers and signalling systems.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c8c7742ee5153cc077a028914401045fa14a887","amp;dn":"Practical+Electronic+Model+Railway+Projects-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c8c7742ee5153cc077a028914401045fa14a887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,140,119,66,238,81,83,204,7,122,2,137,20,64,16,69,250,20,168,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
