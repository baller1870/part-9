Packed with the tastes and pleasures of Italian life, her extraordinary memoirs celebrate the fascinating lifestyle she discovered in the spectacular Tuscany countryside. \n  When she first sees the abandoned villa on the hillside, Frances Mayes knows she must make it her own. Each day with her Italian property brings fresh challenges and delightful surprises. When layers of paint are removed in her dining room, an ancient, faded fresco appearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½only to be marred with a workmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s note to himself in black marker. Struggling to clear dense weeds, she uncovers both a long lost vineyard and a crumbling Etruscan stone wall. \n  A feast for the senses, Under the Tuscan Sun explores the fascinating people, landscape, and history of ItalyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all liberally seasoned with hearty recipes. As Barbara Caruso dramatically narrates, centuries-old hill towns and salt-of-the-earth characters burst colorfully from the pages.\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\n...The book is a memoir of Mayes buying, renovating, and living in an abandoned villa in rural Cortona in Tuscany, a region of Italy. It went to Number One on the New York Times Best Seller list and remained on the list for over two years. \n  In 2003 the film Under the Tuscan Sun was released. Adapted to the screen by director Audrey Wells, the movie was loosely based on Mayes's book. In 1999, Mayes followed this literary success with another international bestseller, Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy, and in 2000 with In Tuscany. Mayes's first novel, Swan, was published in 2002. With photographer Steven Rothfeld and her husband Edward Mayes, she published the phototext Bringing Tuscany Home in 2004. A memoir &quot;Every Day in Tuscany&quot; was released in March, 2010. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328589/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328589/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n- Number One on the New York Times Best Seller list, 2+ yrs\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2de20d924094a315cda3a2272b848a1772eb18","amp;dn":"UNDER+THE+TUSCAN+SUN+-+Frances+Mayes.+Barbara+Caruso+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2de20d924094a315cda3a2272b848a1772eb18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,45,226,13,146,64,148,163,21,205,163,162,39,43,132,138,23,114,235,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
