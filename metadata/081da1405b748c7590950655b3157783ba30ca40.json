Additionally, the team received a new headquarters, The Watchtower, which was based on the Moon.  JLA quickly became the best-selling title at DC, a position it enjoyed off and on for several years. \n\nMorrison introduced the idea of the JLA allegorically representing a pantheon of gods (with their different powers and personalities) incorporating such characters as:  Zauriel; Big Barda; Orion; Huntress; Barbara Gordon (Oracle;) Steel (John Henry Irons;) and Plastic Man.  He also had as temporaries:  Aztek; Tomorrow Woman; and Green Arrow (Connor Hawke.)\n\nUnder Morrison, the series pitted The League against a variety of enemies.  These included White Martians, renegade angels, a new incarnation of the Injustice Gang led by Lex Luthor, and The Key.  Other foes were the new villain Prometheus; the existing JLA villain Starro, The Conqueror; The Ultra-Marines; and a futuristic Darkseid.  Morrison departed after issue 41, in an arc titled World War III, which involves The New Gods preparing the Earth for battle against a creature known as Maggedon, a super-sentient weapon of mass destruction.\n\nThis torrent, created to honor a most excellent request, contains ALL Grant Morrison issues of JLA Volume 3.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081da1405b748c7590950655b3157783ba30ca40","amp;dn":"Grant+Morrison%27s+JLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081da1405b748c7590950655b3157783ba30ca40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,29,161,64,91,116,140,117,144,149,6,85,179,21,119,131,186,48,202,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
