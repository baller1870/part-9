Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those '80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera's mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new album debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; was getting massive airplay.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Rock The World\n02.Power Metal\n03.We'll Meet Again\n04.Over And Out\n05.Proud To Be Loud\n06.Down Below\n07.Death Trap\n08.Hard Ride\n09.Burnnn!\n10.P.S.T.  88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69248d1fd9d196dee9c2800bc9928d63dc0af87d","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+Power+Metal+%281988%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69248d1fd9d196dee9c2800bc9928d63dc0af87d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,36,141,31,217,209,150,222,233,194,128,11,201,146,141,99,220,10,248,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
