Jeff Beck paid fitting tribute to Les Paul last summer, celebrating what would have been the pioneering guitarist's 95th birthday by playing his friend and mentor's music, along with classic tunes from the era, in the same Times Square nightclub that Les Paul played every Monday for 14 years, before his death in August 2009.\nSponsored by Gibson Guitar, Jeff Beck was joined by The Imelda May Band at the Iridium Jazz Club on June 9th, 2010. The two-time Rock And Roll Hall of Fame inductee mesmerized the star-studded audience with a tour de force performance of classics that Paul recorded with Mary Ford, 'How High The Moon,' and 'Vaya Con Dios,' along with rock and roll standards. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328b48914f0ff5e60cd0ec952a6b4ab73061d8b7","amp;dn":"Jeff+Beck+-+Rock+%5C%27n%5C%27+Roll+Party+%5Bdeluxe-2cd-mp3-320-2011%5D%5Btrfk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328b48914f0ff5e60cd0ec952a6b4ab73061d8b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,139,72,145,79,15,245,230,12,208,236,149,42,107,74,183,48,97,216,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
