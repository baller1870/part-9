While the Brigade regulars are consistent on much of the record (eenor, Skerik, and new percussionist Mike &quot;Tree Frog&quot; Dillon), many special guests grace the album as well. &quot;D&amp;#039;s Diner&quot; features sitar player Gabby Lang in addition to the triple-bass onslaught of Claypool, Norwood Fisher (Fishbone) and Lonnie Marshall (Weapon of Choice). Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers, GovÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹t Mule, Phil Lesh) handles guitar on the psychedelic hillbilly stomp of &quot;Buzzards of Green Hill&quot; and Fish Fisher (Fishbone drummer) guests on &quot;Whamola,&quot; a live show staple named after the unique instrument Les employs -- a one-string bass played with a drumstick. Those in the know will recognize the references in &quot;Barrington Hall,&quot; named after a Berkeley dorm and series of parties immortalized on Primus&amp;#039; &quot;Frizzle Fry,&quot; which was reissued earlier this year. Original Frog drummer Jay Lane (Ratdog, Sausage) appears on four songs, while Bay Area monster Dean Johnson also makes an appearance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334f8682eed86f21d4f7cf8bf51c5531377d6e5c","amp;dn":"Les+Claypool+-+Purple+Onion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334f8682eed86f21d4f7cf8bf51c5531377d6e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,79,134,130,238,216,111,33,212,247,207,139,245,28,85,49,55,125,110,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
