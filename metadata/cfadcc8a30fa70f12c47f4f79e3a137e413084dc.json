Molland (Editor)\nMSc, PhD, CEng, FRINA Emeritus Professor of Ship Design, University of Southampton, UK\n\nNon-Fiction\nHardbound, 920pp, 2008\nButterworth-Heinemann (Elsevier imprint)\nISBN: 9780750689878\n\n\nThe Maritime Engineering Reference Book is a one-stop source for engineers involved in marine engineering and naval architecture. In this essential reference, Anthony F. Molland has brought together the work of a number of the world's leading writers in the field to create an inclusive volume for a wide audience of marine engineers, naval architects and those involved in marine operations, insurance and other related fields. Coverage ranges from the basics to more advanced topics in ship design, construction and operation. All the key areas are covered, including ship flotation and stability, ship structures, propulsion, seakeeping and maneuvering.\n\nThe marine environment and maritime safety are explored as well as new technologies, such as computer aided ship design and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Facts, figures and data from world-leading experts (including Bryan Barrass, Rawson and Tupper, and David Eyres) makes this an invaluable ready-reference for those involved in the field of maritime engineering.\n\nProfessor A.F. Molland (BSc, MSc, PhD, Eng, FRINA) is Emeritus Professor of Ship Design at the University of Southampton, UK. He has lectured ship design and operation for many years. He has carried out extensive research and published widely on ship design and various aspects of ship hydrodynamics.\n\n1 The Marine Environment\n2 Marine Vehicle Types\n3 Flotation and Stability\n4 Ship Structures\n5 Powering\n6 Marine Engines and Auxiliary Machinery\n7 Seakeeping\n8 Manoeuvring\n9 Ship Design, Construction and Operation\n10 Underwater Vehicles\n11 Marine Safety\n12 Glossary of Terms and Definitions\nAuthor Biographies\nIndex\n\n-------\nNote...\nThe subject book has been uploaded in a larger file size PDF (77Mb, and devoid of addit'l features) as a torrent before to various sites, and might still be available as HASH 8ef14eab00652f81b0329f6db323eb10706cd21.\n\nBUT THIS particular PDF version of the file that I'm uploading is of smaller size (29Mb), has bookmarking, slightly clearer cover, seemingly better page images, and active navigational linkage within the body of text.\nThis particular PDF version of the book is NOT my scan, nor my bookmarking... but the separate &quot;BOOK DESCRIPTION&quot; file that accompanies the book IS by Greencuppa.\n\n\n==========\nPlease be advised that I have a very slow connection (c.30-60kB up), as well as sporadically connectable state... so things might take awhile to grab from me.\n~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfadcc8a30fa70f12c47f4f79e3a137e413084dc","amp;dn":"Maritime+Engineering+Reference+Book+%5Bstatic+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfadcc8a30fa70f12c47f4f79e3a137e413084dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,173,204,138,48,250,112,241,44,71,244,247,158,58,19,126,65,48,132,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
