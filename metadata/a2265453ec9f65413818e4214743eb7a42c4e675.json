Do we have to strip away all femininity to make a female character strong? How do we keep a strong female character likeable? If we're writing historical fiction or science fiction or fantasy based on a historical culture, how far can we stray from the historical records when creating our female characters? \n\nIn Strong Female Characters: A Busy Writer's Guide you'll learn \n- what Ã¢â‚¬Å“strong female charactersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means, \n- the keys to writing characters who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t match stereotypical male or female qualities, \n- how to keep strong female characters likeable, and \n- what roles women actually played in history. \n\nEach book in the Busy WriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide series is intended to give you enough theory so that you can understand why things work and why they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, but also enough examples to see how that theory looks in practice. In addition, they provide tips and exercises to help you take it to the pages of your own story with an editor's-eye view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2265453ec9f65413818e4214743eb7a42c4e675","amp;dn":"Strong+Female+Characters+%28Busy+Writer%27s+Guides+Book+1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2265453ec9f65413818e4214743eb7a42c4e675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,38,84,83,236,159,101,65,56,24,228,33,71,67,235,122,66,196,230,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
