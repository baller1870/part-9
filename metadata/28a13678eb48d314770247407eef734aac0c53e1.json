Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to \nParkinson&amp;#039;s disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest \nto the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable \nportfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, \ndespite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The \nmiddle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing \nspectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped \na disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain on \nan affair with a married manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or so her mother fears. Desperate for some \npleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: \nbringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.\n\nStretching from the Midwest at midcentury to the Wall Street and Eastern \nEurope of today, The Corrections brings an old-fashioned world of civic virtue \nand sexual inhibitions into violent collision with the era of home surveillance, \nhands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental health care, and globalized greed. \nRichly realistic, darkly hilarious, deeply humane, it confirms Jonathan Franzen \nas one of our most brilliant interpreters of American society and the American \nsoul.\n\n----\n\nRead by Dylan Baker\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a13678eb48d314770247407eef734aac0c53e1","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Franzen+-+The+Corrections","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28a13678eb48d314770247407eef734aac0c53e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,161,54,120,235,72,211,20,119,2,71,64,126,239,115,74,172,12,83,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
