Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, extended song lengths, abstract lyrics, and a general showcasing of instrumental prowess. Yes blends symphonic and other 'classical' structures with their own brand of musical style. Despite a great many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band has continued on for over forty years and still retains a large following.[1] Band members Chris Squire, Steve Howe and Alan White toured in late 2008 and early 2009 with vocalist BenoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®t David and keyboardist Oliver Wakeman on the In The Present Tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesyears 1991\n\nYesyears is a career-spanning collection of music by progressive rock band Yes released as a four-disc box set in 1991. It was compiled following the release of Union and Yes's departure from Atlantic Records, with whom they had been contracted since 1969 (and the offshoot label Atco Records since 1983). Yesyears covers the band's musical story from 1969's debut Yes to studio material recorded with Billy Sherwood following Jon Anderson's departure in 1988.\nOne of the major attractions of YesYears was its inclusion of rare material, including many previously unreleased songs, and a full-colour booklet detailing Yes's history.\nA condensed version of this package, entitled Yesstory, would be released in 1992 on two discs.\nYesyears was deleted in the late 1990s, preceding the release of Rhino Records' (five-disc) box set In a Word: Yes (1969 - ) in 2002. Most of the material found on Yesyears but not on In a word would surface on Rhino's reissues of Yes albums in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\n\n CD 1 \n\n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Something's Coming&quot; (originally released as the B-Side to &quot;Sweetness&quot; in July 1969)\n2.\t&quot;Survival&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Every Little Thing&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Then&quot; (a BBC recording on 19 January 1970)\n5.\t&quot;Everydays&quot; (a BBC recording on 4 August 1969)\n6.\t&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Time and a Word&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Starship Trooper&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Life Seeker&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Disillusion&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rm&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Your Move&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;All Good People&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nCD 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Roundabout&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;America&quot; (single edit)\n4.\t&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;The Solid time of Change&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Total Mass Retain&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;I Get Up I Get Down&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Seasons of Man&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Ritual (Nous Sommes Du Soleil)&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Sound Chaser&quot;  \n\n\n\n\n\nCD 3 \n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Soon&quot; (single edit)\n2.\t&quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (previously unreleased and recorded in November 1976)\n3.\t&quot;Vevey, Part One&quot; (previously unreleased and recorded in February 1978)\n4.\t&quot;Wondrous Stories&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Awaken&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Montreux's Theme&quot; (previously unreleased and recorded during Going for the One's sessions)\n7.\t&quot;Vevey, Part Two&quot; (previously unreleased and recorded in February 1978)\n8.\t&quot;Going for the One&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Money&quot; (previously unreleased and recorded during Tormato's sessions, with a spoken overdub by Rick Wakeman)\n10.\t&quot;Abilene&quot; (originally released as the B-Side of &quot;Don't Kill The Whale&quot; in August 1978)\n11.\t&quot;Don't Kill the Whale&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;On the Silent Wings of Freedom&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;Does It Really Happen?&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;  \n15.\t&quot;Run with the Fox&quot; (a single release in December 1981 credited to Chris Squire and Alan White)\n16.\t&quot;I'm Down&quot; (recorded live in New Jersey on 17 July 1976)\n\n\n\n\nCD 4 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Make It Easy&quot; (previously unreleased)\n2.\t&quot;It Can Happen&quot; (previously unreleased early version, recorded by Cinema prior to Jon Anderson joining the sessions)\n3.\t&quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Hold On&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;Shoot High, Aim Low&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Changes&quot; (live in Houston, Texas, 1988)\n9.\t&quot;And You and I&quot; (live in Houston, Texas, 1988) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Cord of Life&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Eclipse&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;The Preacher the Teacher&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t&quot;Apocalypse&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; (live in Houston, Texas, 1988)\n11.\t&quot;Love Conquers All&quot; (an outtake from Union, recorded in early 1991)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:138a9606a5414117d626c33da42633cceaa5e4d2","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Yes+Years+%284+CD+Box+Set%29+1991+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"138a9606a5414117d626c33da42633cceaa5e4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,138,150,6,165,65,65,23,214,38,195,61,164,38,51,204,234,165,228,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
