With plenty of color photographs, easy-to-follow instructions, and detailed illustrations, Handy Dad is chock-full of creative and inexpensive ways to keep kids (and dads) entertained for hours.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nTodd Davis (1972-) was born in Walnut Creek, California, grew up in Pleasanton, California and has resided in San Francisco for the last ten years.
