In this, Fritz Lang's first sound film, Peter Lorre delivers a haunting performance as the cinema's first serial killer, a whistling paedophile hunted by the police and brought to trial by the forces of the Berlin's underworld.\n\nInspired by a real life manhunt for a serial killer in Dusseldorf, M is the best chase-the-serial killer movie ever made. At once a creepy character study of a psychopathic child murderer and a riveting portrait of a community doused in fear, Lang deploys an arsenal of filmmaking fireworks in league with a progressive attitude towards his subject that is complex and still relevant.\n\n\nI have limited bandwidth. So try and be patient.\n\nAnd seed as much as you can.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bdeffffb9cfe65550afa1f51569f0bca0bb3371","amp;dn":"M+1931+Fritz+Lang+English+subs+BluRay+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bdeffffb9cfe65550afa1f51569f0bca0bb3371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,222,255,255,185,207,230,85,80,175,161,245,21,105,240,188,160,187,51,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
