Each moment born of boundless imagination and a longstanding collaborative relationship, and each as inventive and melodically addictive as those first creative milestones Bring It On and Liquid Skin.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a87e933c85294fdd7f47991b57113c9cd92576","amp;dn":"Gomez+-+A+New+Tide+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a87e933c85294fdd7f47991b57113c9cd92576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,168,126,147,60,133,41,79,221,127,71,153,27,87,17,60,156,217,37,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
