After Stuart attempts open heart massage to save the female victim of a road traffic accident, the trio are sent to see therapist Kirsty Shelmerdine to treat any potential post traumatic stress. She tells them they will be subject to the classic syndrome of Up, Horny, Down where elation is followed by sexual desire, the satisfaction of which will lead to depression. Stuart refuses to give in to his basic emotions and tries his hardest not to give in to his horny side by staying with his police friend Maxine, but ends up insulting her and getting thrown out. Meanwhile, Rachid has sex with a lady barrister and Ashley has a bondage session with a man who ends up causing him trouble. Stuart is the only one of the three boys not to suffer from depression, which makes him ideal for talking a potential suicide down from a bridge. His day ends on a down note, however, and he returns to Maxine to apologize for his actions.\n \n 2. &quot;Two Man Race&quot;\nStuart, Rachid and Ashley find their male pride rattled by the lads from the local fire brigade. As the team make a drop-off in A&amp;E, Stuart observes the waiting room is awash with the dregs of humanity and proclaims he's proud that he is infertile. When Ashley and Rachid tease him that he's not getting any anyway, he informs them that he has a date with Angie (Charlene McKenna), a student and eco-campaigner he met a few weeks back. As soon as he's alone, Stuart digs out her number and quickly arranges the date. After a shaky start, things are going well with Angie, but Stuart seems to be behaving in a macho way that neither he nor his friends recognize. \n\n3. &quot;I.C.E&quot;\nThe paramedics are called out to a young male in a student house who is suffering from drug-induced paranoia. When Rachid goes to talk with a neighbour, he comes across a scary 'purple job' - a suicide victim who has been dead for some time. The realisation that 'Purple Phil' (Felix Scott) wasn't missed by anyone for a fortnight sets off an unlikely chain reaction for ladies' man Rachid. Convinced he doesn't want to meet his maker in similarly lonely circumstances, Rachid decides there is only one answer - he needs to settle down. Only thing is, he's got to find the girl to do it with... \n\n4. &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;\nWhen Woodvine (Annie Hulle) threatens to split up the lads, Stuart's promise that 'his' crew will up their game sparks an immediate challenge to his leadership from Rachid. Stuart may believe that the alpha male is the cleverest rather than strongest member of the pack, but will Rachid's determination to prove him wrong cost him his crown? Meanwhile, Ashley has an alpha male secret of his own, while Maxine tries to bring out her feminine side to appeal to internet date Derek (Graham O'Mara). \n\n5. &quot;Stress&quot;\nStuart is in denial about the stress of his job so he decides to focus on Maxine's unsettled feelings about fireman Craig (Ben Batt), and how they're threatening her chances of promotion. Although he attempts to find subtle ways to reassure Maxine that Craig is really into her, is Stuart really the right man to play Cupid? Will he end up creating more stress for both of them? \n\n6. &quot;Cry&quot;\t\nIn the series finale, Stuart is confronted with a life and death situation, which hits closer to home than expected. Having spent the whole of his adult life trying to deny his true feelings, Stuart is going to need a special friend to help him through this troubling time. The question, when Maxine is so wrapped up in Craig, is who?\nMeanwhile, Ashley is surprised to find he's gained a live-in boyfriend, and Rachid's future as a member of the crew suddenly doesn't look so certain... \n\n\n[ About file ]\nName: sirens.uk.s01e01.avi\nDate: Sat, 03 Aug 2013 04:42:44 +0200\nSize: 576,790,528 bytes (550.07 MiB)\n\n[ Magic ]\nTipo file: RIFF (little-endian) data, AVI, 624 x 352, 25.00 fps, video: XviD, audio: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (stereo, 48000 Hz)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\nDuration: 00:46:21 (2780.96 s)\nContainer: AVI OpenDML\nAVI has index: Yes\nTotal tracks: 2\nTrack nr. 0: video\nTrack nr. 1: audio\nISFT: VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nJunk: VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\n[ Relevant data ]\nResolution: 624 x 352\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 32\nAverage DRF: 2.917\nStandard deviation: 1.037\nStd. dev. weighted mean: 0.514\n\n[ Video track ]\nFourCC: xvid/XVID\nResolution: 624 x 352\nFrame aspect ratio: 39:22 = 1.773 (~16:9)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 39:22 = 1.773 (~16:9)\nFramerate: 25 fps\nTotal frames: 69,524\nStream size: 529,770,690 bytes (505.229 MiB)\nBitrate: 1523.994 kbps\nQf: 0.278\nKey frames: 762 (0; 233; 283; 547; 633; ... 69376)\nNull frames: 0\nMin key int: 1\nMax key int: 300\nAvg key int: 91.239\nDelay: 0 ms\n\n[ Audio track ]\nAudio tag: 0x55 (MP3)\nChannels: 2\nBitrate: 122.368 kbps VBR\nChunks: 115,873\nStream size: 42,537,024 bytes (40.566 MiB)\nBitstream type (bs): MPEG-1 Layer III\nEncoder (bs): LAME3.98r (Made with BeSweet v1.5b31)\nFrames (bs): 115,873\nDuration (bs): 00:46:21 (2780.952 s)\nChunk-aligned (bs): Yes\nBitrate (bs): 122.367 kbps VBR\nSampling frequency (bs): 48000 Hz\nMode (bs): joint stereo\nPadding (bs): No\nEmphasis (bs): none\nPreload: 504 ms\nMax A/V diff: 520 ms\nDelay: 0 ms\n\n[ Video bitstream ]\nBitstream type: MPEG-4 Part 2\nUser data: DivX503b1393p\nUser data: XviD0050\nPacked bitstream: Yes (*)\nQPel: No\nGMC: No\nInterlaced: No\nAspect ratio: Square pixels\nQuant type: H.263\nTotal frames: 69,524\nDrop/delay frames: 0\nCorrupt frames: 0\n\nI-VOPs:   762 (  1.096 %)\nP-VOPs: 24671 ( 35.486 %) #######\nB-VOPs: 44091 ( 63.418 %) #############\nS-VOPs:     0 (  0.000 %)\nN-VOPs:     0 (  0.000 %)\n\nMax consecutive B-VOPs: 2\n    1 consec:  3917 ( 16.318 %) ###\n    2 consec: 20087 ( 83.682 %) #################\n\n[ DRF analysis ]\naverage DRF: 2.917\nstandard deviation: 1.037\nmax DRF: 4\n\nDRF=1:  6753 (  9.713 %) ##\nDRF=2: 20234 ( 29.104 %) ######\nDRF=3: 14594 ( 20.991 %) ####\nDRF=4: 27943 ( 40.192 %) ########\nDRF&gt;4:     0 (  0.000 %)\n\nI-VOPs average DRF: 1.362\nI-VOPs std. deviation: 0.481\nI-VOPs max DRF: 2\n\nP-VOPs average DRF: 1.746\nP-VOPs std. deviation: 0.436\nP-VOPs max DRF: 3\n\nB-VOPs average DRF: 3.598\nB-VOPs std. deviation: 0.558\nB-VOPs max DRF: 4\n\n[ Profile compliancy ]\nSelected profile: MTK PAL 6000\nResolution: Ok\nFramerate: Ok\nMin buffer fill: 80%\n\nThis report was created by  Visit this link:(08-07-2011) on 14-10-2013 20:58:01\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4220a648e2204b04212a6e1d0682894452b4e58c","amp;dn":"Sirens+UK+%28S01e01-06%29+%5BHDTV+XviD+Eng+Mp3+Sub+Ita%5D+%5BTNTvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4220a648e2204b04212a6e1d0682894452b4e58c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,32,166,72,226,32,75,4,33,42,110,29,6,130,137,68,82,180,229,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
