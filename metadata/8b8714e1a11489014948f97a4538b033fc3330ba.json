He delves deep into his volatile, profound, and enduring relationship with singer Steve Tyler and reveals the real people behind the larger-than-life rock-gods on stage. The nearly five-decade saga of Aerosmith is epic, at once a study in brotherhood and solitude that plays out on the killing fields of rock and roll.\n\nWith record-making hits and colossal album sales, Aerosmith has earned their place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But theirs is ultimately a story of endurance, and it starts almost half a century ago with young Perry, the rebel whose loving parents wanted him to assimilate, but who quits school because he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to cut his hair. He meets Tyler in a restaurant in New Hampshire, sways him from pop music to rock-and-roll, and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long for the &quot;Toxic Twins&quot; to skyrocket into a world of fame and utter excess.\n\nFrom the mega-successful song and music video with Run DMC, &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, to the realization that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pay his room service bill, Perry takes a personal look into the human stories behind Aerosmith, the people who enabled them, the ones who controlled them, and the ones who changed them. In his own words, Rocks is the whole story: &quot;the lonerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, the recovery story, the cult story, the love story, the success story, the failure story, the rebirth story, the re-destruction story, the post-destructive rebirth story.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8714e1a11489014948f97a4538b033fc3330ba","amp;dn":"Rocks%3A+My+Life+in+and+out+of+Aerosmith+-+Joe+Perry+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8714e1a11489014948f97a4538b033fc3330ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,135,20,225,161,20,137,1,73,72,249,122,69,56,176,51,252,51,48,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
