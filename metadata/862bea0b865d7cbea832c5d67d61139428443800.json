This mirror didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t show you your reflection.  Instead, it showed you your soul -- it showed you who you really were.  But the king couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look into the mirror without turning away, and nor could his courtiers.  No one could.&quot;\n\nIn his latest novel, Martin Amis asks: What happens when we discover who we really are?  And how do we come to terms with it?  Fearless and original, THE ZONE OF INTEREST is a violently dark love story set against a backdrop of unadulterated evil, and a vivid journey into the depths and contradictions of the human soul.\n\nFor more works by Martin Amis, see &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10533242/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10533242/&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;The Zone of Interest is a tour de force of sheer verbal virtuosity, and a brilliant, celestially upsetting novel inspired by no less than a profound moral curiosity about human beings. It's stunning.&quot; -- Richard Ford\n\n&quot;Amis took on the Holocaust obliquely in Time's Arrow.  Here he goes at it straight, and the result is an absolute soul-crusher of a book [and] brilliant.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\n&quot;Nasty, timely, as good as anything Amis has written since London Fields. . .  He has done his subject justice.&quot; -- Spectator\n\n&quot;It is energetic, deeply researched, it is bracingly cruel.  It makes the reader squirm and resist and finally laugh.&quot; -- Tom Lamont, GQ\n\n&quot;He likes to stamp every sentence with his authority, like the name through a stick of rock, and here he reinvents hell on earth in his distinctively gaudy, insistent, elaborate prose.  It is exceptionally brave, Shakespearean. . . It's exciting; it's alive; it's more than slightly mad.  As the title suggests, it is dreadfully interesting.&quot; -- Theo Tait, Sunday Times\n\n&quot;Auschwitz was, in the most essential sense, 'unspeakable'.  It's thus something only creative writing can speak about. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Amis, that is.  The most daring novelist of our time.&quot; -- John Sutherland, The Times\n\n&quot;Surely his masterpiece. . .  Intelligent, terrifying and comic. . .  Amis has tackled the biggest questions with imagination and intelligence, and the ultimate strength of this masterly novel is that he knows, and shows, that although there is no answer to the questions Auschwitz poses, we must never stop asking them.&quot; -- Allan Massie, Scotsman\n\n&quot;The novel poses the question that will forever haunt the 20th century: how did the most cultivated nation the Earth had ever seen give way to such infamy, 'such wild disgrace'?  Amid the horror of the so-called 'selections' and 'aktions', amid the relentless grind of the Nazi killing machines, humanity somehow survives, and so does comedy.&quot; -- Anthony Quinn, Mail on Sunday\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                                         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
