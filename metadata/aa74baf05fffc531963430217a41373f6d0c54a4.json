Stewart won the BFCA Award, Golden Globe, Sierra Award and the World Soundtrack Award.\n\nWriter/director Charles Shyer's reinvention of the beloved 60's morality tale about a serial-womanizer's quest for meaning in life is musically rooted in a voice that's lived the experience: Mick Jagger. And if the Stones' oft-cliched frontman seems a decidedly left-field choice as film scorer, his chemistry with collaborator/former Eurythmics musical spark Dave Stewart yields a surprisingly warm, often introspective slate of songs and atmospheric underscore. Jagger's solo work has often been muddied by chasing the pop production zeitgeist of the moment, but his efforts with Stewart here largely turn on a stripped-down, organic folk-blues sensibility that can't escape mostly positive parallels with the Stones' own acoustic oeuvre. Soul singer Joss Stone turns in a masterfully bluesy cover of the original film's hit Bacharach-David theme song that belies her teenage years (also interpolating it into Stewart/Jagger's &quot;Wicked Time,&quot; which also features noted Jamaican rapper &quot;Nadz&quot; Seid), while Sheryl Crow duets with Jagger on the single version of the song-score's thematic anchor, &quot;Old Habits Die Hard.&quot;\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstonesnet.com/images/AlfiePromo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstonesnet.com/images/AlfiePromo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1) Old Habits Die Hard - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n2) Blind Leading The Blind - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n3) New York Hustle - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n4) Let's Make It Up - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n5) Wicked Time - Joss Stone &amp; Nadirah &quot;Nadz&quot; (Featuring Mick Jagger)\n6) Lonely Without You - Mick Jagger\n7) Darkness Of Your Love - Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper &amp; Dave Stewart\n8) Jack The Lad - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n9) Nikki - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n10) Blind Leading The Blind - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n11) Standing In The Rain - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n12) Counting The Days - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n13) Old Habits Reprise - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart\n14) Alfie - Joss Stone\n15) Old Habits Die Hard - Mick Jagger &amp; Dave Stewart (Featuring Sheryl Crow)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa74baf05fffc531963430217a41373f6d0c54a4","amp;dn":"Mick+Jagger+and+Dave+Stewart+-+Alfie+%282004%29+OST+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa74baf05fffc531963430217a41373f6d0c54a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,116,186,240,95,255,197,49,150,52,48,33,122,65,55,63,109,12,84,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
