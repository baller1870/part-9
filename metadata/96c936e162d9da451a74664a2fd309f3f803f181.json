It has been founded in 1985, when SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndor JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ka, at the time Hungary's most famous &quot;primas&quot; (gypsy soloist) died. All Hungarian gypsy musicians had come to his funeral. After the ceremony they begin to play. The orchestra had been born out of that improvised moment. The Orchestra has already had enormous success over the last years in many world - famous concert halls and festivals, notably in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italia, Japan, Latvia, Luxemburg, Netherland, Poland, Portugal, Principality of Monaco, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and will perform next in many other countries. Each appearance of the orchestra has an incomparable effect on the audiences: dressed in colourful, traditional dresses the orchestra is much larger than most classical orchestras! Their earthy, native energy thrills everybody. Notably also, that the entire orchestra plays by heart, without score. Quick changes of rhythm, of colour, harmony and style are found in every piece they play, extraordinary variations, rich harmony and instinctive feelings for the unison of the ensemble, for seamless transitions are innate abilities of these musicians\n\n\nCD1\n01.
