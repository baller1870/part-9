Spa treatments today are multi-layered, multi-textured works of art that combine many elements of holistic practice. They are fun to deliver and offer the therapist a creative outlet. Knowledge of spa treatments not only allows massage therapists to offer their clients more options; it gives them a competitive advantage when seeking work in the spa industry.\nThis textbook guides the massage therapist through each step of delivering a treatmentÃ¢â‚¬â€from a consideration of the indications and contraindications to scope of practice issues, the supplies needed, how to set up the room and practical tips on the specific steps involved. It also provides ideas for massage therapists on how to integrate massage techniques, spa products and enhancing accents, so you can create and deliver unique services.\nWhile wet-room equipment and techniques are discussed throughout the book, the focus is on the delivery of spa treatments in a dry-room setting. This approach allows for the use of spa services in a variety of settings such as a classroom, private practice, and massage clinic or day spa without the need for expensive wet-room equipment.\n\nTable of Contents\nAcknowledgements iii\nPreface v\nPART ONE Spa Foundations 1\n1 Spa from Past to Present 2\n2 Spa Equipment and Products 13\n3 Client and Therapist Safety 32\n4 Your Spa Massage 68\n5 Foundation Skills for Spa Treatment Delivery 96\n6 Water Therapies 110\n7 Introduction to Aromatherapy for Spa 129\nPART TWO Spa Treatments 154\n8 Exfoliation Treatments 155\n9 Body Wraps 173\n10 Spa Foot Treatments 194\n11 Fangotherapy 215\n12 Thalassotherapy 232\n13 Stone Massage 247\n14 Culturally Based Spa Treatments 265\nPART THREE Your Spa Career 316\n15 Treatment Design and Your Signature Spa Treatment 317\n16 Your Spa Program and Menu of Services 334\n17 You in the Spa Profession 353\nAPPENDICES\nGlossary 421\nReferences 426\nIndex 431","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508bcc56eaee98d6e03c36426d656e6210d0fccc","amp;dn":"Spa+Bodywork+-+A+Guide+for+Massage+Therapists+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508bcc56eaee98d6e03c36426d656e6210d0fccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,139,204,86,234,238,152,214,224,60,54,66,109,101,110,98,16,208,252,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
