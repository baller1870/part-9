It was initially released without &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, which had not yet been recorded. When &quot;Horse&quot; became a worldwide hit in early 1972, the album was re-released with that track.\n\nThe album went to #1 on the Billboard album chart in the US and stayed there for five weeks. It produced two hit singles; &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot; spent three weeks at #1 on the Billboard singles chart in 1972 (it peaked at #3 on the Adult Contemporary chart), and &quot;I Need You&quot; hit #9 on the Billboard singles chart and #7 on the AC chart. Several other songs received radio airplay on FM stations playing album tracks, including &quot;Sandman&quot; (long rumoured in the US Navy to be about the VQ-2 air squadron formerly based in Rota, Spain) and &quot;Three Roses&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of one million units in the US.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08328f35881d86c0a725373fc8bf1327b7ec36f","amp;dn":"America+-+America+%282013%29+SACD+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08328f35881d86c0a725373fc8bf1327b7ec36f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,131,40,243,88,129,216,108,10,114,83,115,252,139,241,50,123,126,195,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
