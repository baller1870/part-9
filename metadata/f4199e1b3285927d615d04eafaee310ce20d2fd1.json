Joao Gilberto, 1975\nRecorded in 1975, released in 1976\n\n\nGenerally overlooked at the time of its release, The Best of Two Worlds is a jazzy masterpiece that builds on GetzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clutch of Bossa Nova recordings in the early 60s by reuniting the saxophonist with Brazilian vocalist and guitarist JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto and his wife singing in English and Portuguese with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where the semblance ends.\n\nIn place of the intimate course set by Getz/Gilberto producer Taylor, Teo Macero allows Getz to expand the jazzier side of his play. Instead of Astrud Gilberto (JoÃƒÂ£oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first wife), weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re treated to Miucha (JoÃƒÂ£oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second wife), whose U.S. debut on this recording introduced many of us to new subtleties of Brazilian charm. Her genuine vocal warmth contrasted nicely against the pop appeal of AstrudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings, which had failed to keep pace with the changing musical scene.\n\nOscar Castro-Neves contributes the arrangements for each of these 10 tracks along with his rhythm guitar play, while American jazzers took hold of the rhythm section to provide another contrast to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœGetz/GilbertoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album, where Brazilians were brought together to anchor the rhythm section behind the tenor sax play. Here the group is led by pianist Albert Daily, drummer Grady Tate and Steve SwallowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass. Airto Moreira returned from his participation on GetzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1972 album   Captain Marvel to anchor the percussion play.\n\nThis would be Stan and JoÃƒÂ£oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last studio date together. As masters of their individual domains, each brought their best qualities to this recording, making The Best of Two Worlds a stellar choice for your collection. \n \n\nStan Getz &amp; Joao Gilberto\nThe Best of Two Worlds 1975\n\nCD / 2005 / 320Kbps\n\nTracklist:\n01.
