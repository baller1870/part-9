Many thousands of non-European and Muslim immigrants and refugees who took advantage of Sweden's generous immigration policies now find themselves the object of discrimination and worse.\n\nThrough the cascading juxtaposition of many voices, including his own, Pred describes the intensifying cultural racism of the 1990s, the proliferation of negative ethnic stereotypes, and the spatial segregation of the non-Swedish. He quotes the newspaper Dagens Nyheter: &quot;It is high time that Sweden reconsider its self-image as the stronghold of tolerance&quot; (July 21, 1998), and analyzes the strategies that allow people to maintain that self-image. Perhaps the greatest strength of Even in Sweden is that Pred gives to the social consequences of global economic restructuring some very specific faces and places and a multitude of expressions of human will, both ill and good.\n\n\n[b] Editorial Reviews [/b]\nFrom the Inside Flap\n&quot;A tour de force&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Orvar LÃƒÂ¶fgren, co-author of Culture Builders: A Historical Anthropology of Middle Class Life\n\n&quot;Written in a striking, experimental style, this is an insightful and impressive book on a topic of enormous contemporary significance.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€James Ferguson, author of Expectations of Modernity\n\n&quot;Pred works with a powerful set of ideas and arresting empirical materials to create a series of interlocking, overlapping, and superimposed spaces within which modern racism is brought into view with a shocking clarity. &quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Derek Gregory, author of Geographical Imaginations\nFrom the Back Cover\n&quot;A tour de force&quot; (Orvar Lfgren, co-author of Culture Builders: A Historical Anthropology of Middle Class Life)\n\n&quot;Written in a striking, experimental style, this is an insightful and impressive book on a topic of enormous contemporary significance.&quot; (James Ferguson, University of California, Irvine )\n\n&quot;Pred works with a powerful set of ideas and arresting empirical materials to create a series of interlocking, overlapping, and superimposed spaces within which modern racism is brought into view with a shocking clarity. &quot; (Derek Gregory, author of Geographical Imaginations ) --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. \n\n\n\nPaperback: 300 pages\nPublisher: University of California Press; 1 edition (November 6, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0520224493\nISBN-13: 978-0520224490\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Even-Sweden-Racialized-Geographical-Imagination/dp/0520224493/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Even-Sweden-Racialized-Geographical-Imagination/dp/0520224493/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTags: race, racism, discrimination, xenophobia, nationalism, svensk, sverige, invandrare, blatte, muslim, islam, africa, african, black, false, mask, white privilege, superiority, inferiority, nigger cake, neger, ghettoization, linguistic discrimination, christianity, sweden, swedish, european, eastern european, aryan, germany, nazi, ss, wehrmacht, heer, bundeswehr, nsdp, sd, swedish democrats, svenska demokraterna, moderat, moderatarna, nya moderatarna, jobs, economic , redlining, SÃƒÂ¶dertÃƒÂ¤lje, Rinkeby, riot, riots, police, military, job exclusion, suppressed racism, arrogance, scandanavia, norway, denmark, finland, iceland, homelessness, apathy, riksdagen, SkÃƒÂ¥ne, SmÃƒÂ¥land, laserman, laserman II, sniper, serial killer, crime, justice system, sentencing disparity, racism in language, racist jokes, immigration policy, welfare, rehabilitation,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b428137d16a2927df84e6253c07dd182392d314f","amp;dn":"Even+in+Sweden%3A+Racisms%2C+Racialized+Spaces%2C+and+the+Popular+Geog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b428137d16a2927df84e6253c07dd182392d314f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,40,19,125,22,162,146,125,248,78,98,83,192,125,209,130,57,45,49,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
