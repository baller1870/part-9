It tells the story of Charles Ryder's infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly-disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognize only his spiritual and social distance from them.\n\nAbout the Author\nEvelyn Waugh (1903-1966) was born into a publishing family in Hampstead, England, and educated at Oxford. After a brief stint as a schoolmaster, he turned to writing. His biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti appeared in 1928, but it was his sensational first novel, Decline and Fall, published the same year, that set the course for his career. Waugh wrote sixteen novels, including The Loved One, Scoop, and Brideshead Revisited.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - first published 1944\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d0a306d3c1715a19fdf18d2ff8e26b9e8afa37a","amp;dn":"Brideshead+Revisited+by+Evelyn+Waugh+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d0a306d3c1715a19fdf18d2ff8e26b9e8afa37a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,10,48,109,60,23,21,161,159,223,24,210,255,142,38,185,232,175,163,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
