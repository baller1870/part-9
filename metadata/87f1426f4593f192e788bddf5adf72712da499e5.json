It is the most popular Wishbone Ash album and widely considered their greatest by fans and reviewers. It was named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; in the 1972 year-end issue of Sounds magazine. The album features a blend of progressive rock, folk, and hard rock, and is considered a landmark album in the progression of twin-lead guitar harmonization later adopted by bands such as Thin Lizzy and Iron Maiden. The sound engineer on Argus was Martin Birch, who also worked with Deep Purple, later with Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and other hard rock/heavy metal bands.[3] The bulk of the melodies and lyrics were provided by bassist/lead vocalist Martin Turner, although all members contributed to the song arrangements\n\n&quot;Time Was&quot;\n&quot;Sometime World&quot;\n&quot;Blowin' Free&quot;\n&quot;The King Will Come&quot;\n&quot;Leaf and Stream&quot;\n&quot;Warrior&quot;\n&quot;Throw Down the Sword&quot;\n&quot;No Easy Road&quot;\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f1426f4593f192e788bddf5adf72712da499e5","amp;dn":"Wishbone+Ash-Argus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f1426f4593f192e788bddf5adf72712da499e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,241,66,111,69,147,241,146,231,136,189,223,90,223,114,113,45,164,153,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
