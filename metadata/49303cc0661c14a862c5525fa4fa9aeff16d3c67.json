But when the plan goes sour, the couple must flee to Mexico as fast as they can, with a variety of gun-wielding thugs on their trail.\n\n  It's better than the 1994 remake starring Kim Basinger and husband Alec Baldwin. (Which wasn't that bad a movie).\n\n  Starring: Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Sally Struthers, Al Lettieri, Slim Pickens.\n\n  Directed by: Sam Peckinpah.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 58min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49303cc0661c14a862c5525fa4fa9aeff16d3c67","amp;dn":"The+Getaway+%281972%29+%28Steve+McQueen%2C+Ali+MacGraw%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49303cc0661c14a862c5525fa4fa9aeff16d3c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,48,60,192,102,28,20,168,98,197,82,95,164,250,154,239,241,109,60,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
