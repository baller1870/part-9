It was the band's last album with drummer Derek Grant, who left the group the following year. The album's musical direction continued the band's style of ska punk but moved in more of a hardcore direction, with most songs lasting under two minutes in and consisting of fast, aggressive musicianship and vocals. A music video was filmed for the single &quot;Give&quot; and the song was featured in the Disney Channel motion picture Brink! The album peaked at #127 on the Billbard 200.\n\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n1. &quot;Someone&quot;                1:34\n2. &quot;Hating Hate&quot;            1:04\n3. &quot;Give&quot;                   2:19\n4. &quot;Hope&quot;                   1:26\n5. &quot;Black &amp; White World&quot;    1:52\n6. &quot;Numbers&quot;                0:53\n7. &quot;High Society&quot;           1:57\n8. &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;       0:50\n9. &quot;Confused&quot;               2:07\n10. &quot;DDT&quot;                   1:05\n11. &quot;Punck&quot;                 0:04\n12. &quot;Step One&quot;              1:12\n13. &quot;In the End&quot;            2:04\n14. &quot;Face Another Day&quot;      1:47\n15. &quot;What You Say&quot;          1:00\n16. &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;         1:52\n17. &quot;Empty Room&quot;            2:12\n18. &quot;Independence Parade&quot;   1:52\n19. &quot;Sympathy&quot;              1:48\n20. &quot;Strike&quot;                1:17\n21. &quot;Sides&quot;                 1:18\n22. &quot;Jah&quot;                   0:05\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0958bd0175b3ea70d0af84b76842b83f877c598a","amp;dn":"The+Suicide+Machines+-+Battle+Hymns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0958bd0175b3ea70d0af84b76842b83f877c598a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,88,189,1,117,179,234,112,208,175,132,183,104,66,184,63,135,124,89,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
