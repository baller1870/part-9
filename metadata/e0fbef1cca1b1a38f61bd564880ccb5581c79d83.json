Knowing it was written by a zen student, I too a zen student looked forward. I was not disappointed. Some clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and old myths run by, yet the creativity and NOIR style of the film was excellent. It was very funny as well. My concern is that the film may best be appreciated by those in the know on zen only. But I have recommended this film to every 'spiritual' person I know. Dealing with the notion of death and change is not an easy thing, but this film deals with these issues in an amusing, enjoyable, yet penetratingly deep fashion. The inclusion of Kim Chan is a stroke of genius. He's great as the old zen master. \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n~You don't have to like Oranges to love this one~\nAuthor: marcvann-1 from United States\n\nWow. You won't see ANY films like this. Completely original. Funny, mysterious, slightly disturbing. HIghly recommend. And, if you know anything about Zen Buddhism, a must see. This filmmaker has created a little work of art in Zen Noir. It takes you on a ride that is constantly throwing you off balance, and whacking your synapses in weird places, but in a humorous almost loving way. He creatively merges the worlds of Film Noir and Zen Buddhism, and they blend together perfectly. You definitely leave with more questions than you went in with. I'd tell ya more, but I don't want to be a spoiler. Actually, I think this is unspoilable. I'm still not even sure what happened. \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n~Best (and only) zen murder-mystery comedy I've ever seen!~\nAuthor: Ellen Groves from Boston, MA\n\nIf David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch and the Buddha ever got together to make a film, this would be it. Zen Noir is that rare movie which engages you on every level ? mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. And it's also funny as hell!! Rosenbush has a thorough understanding of both the noir genre AND zen practice, and he has managed somehow to merge them inside a single story. The gorgeous, powerful visuals and beautiful, haunting score reminded me of Bertolluci's Little Buddha, but with less sentimentality and more belly laughs. Deep and slapstick, sad and surreal, this is a truly inspiring work of art. Marc Rosenbush is one of the most original filmmakers I've come across in a long time, and I'm really excited to see what he does next!\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nWidth   : 720 pixels\nHeight  : 416 pixels\nDuration: 1:11.36\nBit Rate: 448kbps\nFrames  : 23fps\nData    : 332kbps\nSample  : 12 bit\nVideo   : Div\n\n\nFiles in this torrent:\n\nlistoffiles.txt         \nZen Noir (DVDRIP).avi   \n               2 File(s)  1,461,805,056 bytes\n\n\nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nFor more Buddhist Dharma Torrents see: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/lozory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/lozory&lt;/a&gt; \n\nBrought to you by: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n @@  @@                                            \n @@ @@                                             \n @@@@     @@@   @@@  @@@@@@@   @@@   @@@@    @@@   \n @@@        @@  @@ @ @@ @@ @@    @@  @@ @@     @@  \n @@@@     @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@ @@   @@@@  \n @@ @@   @@ @@  @@   @@ @@ @@ @@ @@  @@ @@  @@ @@  \n @@  @@   @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@@@    @@@@  \n                                     @@\n\t\t\t             @@          \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0fbef1cca1b1a38f61bd564880ccb5581c79d83","amp;dn":"Zen+Buddhist+Movie+-+Zen+Noir+-+Karmapa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0fbef1cca1b1a38f61bd564880ccb5581c79d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,251,239,28,202,27,26,56,246,27,213,100,136,12,203,85,129,199,157,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
