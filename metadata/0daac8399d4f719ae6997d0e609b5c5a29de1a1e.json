It is censored because it exposes the New World Order too clearly.\nYou see, we are supposed to accept this world dictatorship slowly by getting used to it.

These fuckers believe that just because they run with the Illuminati they belong to the top small percentage elite. They simply don't - they will simly get raped and killed just like everybody else.\nI think it is very strong of Jeff and Nicki to dare to expose this fascistic illuminati plan.\n \nAlex Jones talks with music video direct Jeff Osbourne about his controversial new video for Nicki Minaj's song Only","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0daac8399d4f719ae6997d0e609b5c5a29de1a1e","amp;dn":"Nicki+Minaj+-+Only+-+Censored+Music+Video+-+ft.+Drake%2C+Lil+Wayne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0daac8399d4f719ae6997d0e609b5c5a29de1a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,170,200,57,157,79,113,154,230,153,125,14,96,155,92,90,41,222,26,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
