She has earned 11 Grammy Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, an ALMA Award and numerous United States and internationally certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums. She has also earned nominations for a Tony Award and a Golden Globe award.\n\nRonstadt has collaborated with artists from a diverse spectrum of genres including Billy Eckstine,[4] Frank Zappa, Rosemary Clooney, Flaco JimÃƒÂ©nez, Philip Glass, Carla Bley, The Chieftains, Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Dolly Parton, Neil Young, Johnny Cash, and Nelson Riddle. She has lent her voice to over 120 albums.[5] Christopher Loudon of Jazz Times noted in 2004, Ronstadt is &quot;Blessed with arguably the most sterling set of pipes of her generation ... rarest of rarities Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a chameleon who can blend into any background yet remain boldly distinctive ... It's an exceptional gift; one shared by few others.&quot;[6]\n\nIn total, she has released over 30 studio albums and 15 compilations or greatest hits albums. Ronstadt charted 38 Billboard Hot 100 singles, with 21 reaching the top 40, 10 in the top 10, three at #2 and &quot;You're No Good&quot; at #1. In the UK, her single &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; reached the UK Top 40[7] and the duet with Aaron Neville, &quot;Don't Know Much&quot;, peaked at No. 2 in December 1989.[8] In addition, she has charted 36 albums, 10 top-10 albums and three #1 albums on the Billboard Pop Album Charts.\n\nIn a 2011 interview with the Arizona Daily Star she said, &quot;I am 100 percent retired and I'm not doing anything any more&quot;. It was announced publicly in August 2013 that Linda had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in December 2012, which left her unable to sing.[9]\n\nHer book Simple Dreams: A Musical Memoir[10] was released September 17, 2013. [\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1976\n\nGreatest Hits was Linda Ronstadt's first major compilation album, released at the end of 1976 for the holiday shopping season. It included material from both her Capitol Records and Asylum Records output, and went back to 1967 for The Stone Poneys' hit &quot;Different Drum&quot;. It remains the biggest-selling album of Ronstadt's entire career, being certified seven times Platinum (over 7 million US copies sold) by the RIAA[4] in America alone and has sold nearly 20 million worldwide as of 2011. It peaked at #6 on the main Billboard album chart and also reached #2 on Billboard's Country albums chart, where it remained for over three years.\n\nThis album has sold nearly 20 million copies worldwide as of 2012. It was criticized by the Rolling Stone Record Guide for being &quot;premature&quot;, as Ronstadt continued to have great mainstream successes with her next several albums following this one.
