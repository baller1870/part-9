To help readers build featured projects, Elektor also offer PCBs (printed circuit boards) of many of their designs, as well as kits and modules. If the project employs a microcontroller and/or PC software, as is now often the case, Elektor normally supply the sourcecode and files free of charge via their website. Most PCB artwork is also available from their website.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHere's a PARTIAL list of the Articles included:\n\nDSC Monitor, September 2006, ref. 040398 -1 \nPico USB scopes get a speed boost \nSurface-mount resistor with 20 watts power rating \nBecome a video game developer with the Propeller powered Hydra \nSee twelve cylinders of secondary ignition on your oscilloscope \nICs simplify HID ballast circuits and extend lamp life \nSplit-core transducers for AC current measurement \nProfiler - Construction kit for a general-purpose milling machine \nExplorer-16 (1) - Part 1: introduction to MPLAB, C30 and Proteus VSM \nThe Quest for Accuracy - Time measurement using atomic clocks \nClocking, Texas-style - A 300 MHz spread-spectrum clock generator from TI \nTurbo Tricks - Notebook and microcontroller overclocking \nSputnik Time Machine - Nostalgia and microcontroller tech merged single design \nBerlin Clock Remake - Using the SPI bus \nText at the Speed of Light - rotating message display with LEDs and an AVR micro \nScoot me up, Scotty - Scooter tuning without getting your hands dirty \nWarp Speed on Demand - Modern car engine optimisation in the electronic garage \nFPGA Course (8) - Part 8: Playing with the USB port \nBlinking Christmas decoration \nTest beeper for your stereo \nImproving RFID Reader Sensitivity - ten picofarads are worth five centimetres \nElectromechanical switching technology \nPoke 16384,#FF \nShortwave Capture\nHigh-Power - High-output LEDs come to town \nFreescale launches RAppID ToolBox \nSmallest DAB radio module \nGood progress in environmentally-friendly lead free soldering \nSee the LITE on temperature monitoring \n50O RF switch for DC at 6 GHz \nSensorless motor control platform \nWireless electrical sub-metering components \nZigBee protocol platform with 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver \nFlying Robots - Drones: From remote control to UAV and roboplane \n3, 2, 1, Takeoff!
