Rich covers   \n     how to merge multiple exposures to show an extended dynamic range  \n     of scenes, as well as preprocess images to reduce ghosting,        \n     noise, and chromatic aberration. He also reviews tone mapping and  \n     exposure fusions, and solutions to common problems you'll          \n     encounter in HDR images, such as color cast. At the end of the     \n     course, Rich offers a series of challenges to test your            \n     skills.                                                            \n                                                                        \n     This course was created and produced by Rich Harrington.
