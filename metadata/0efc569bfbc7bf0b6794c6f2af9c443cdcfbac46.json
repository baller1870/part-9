From the implementation of CommonJS, Cloud Services, MVC design patterns and more, the last year in Titanium development has been a roller coaster of change for the better. Augmented Reality is a hot area for mobile applications and this book along with the augmentedTi open source application will give a great start to all augmented applications..\n\nThis book will show you how to build an Augmented Reality application, which is clean, efficient and usable. It shows how to hide the processing from the user and build a display which updates and rotates smoothly.\n\nMobile devices have got more powerful, but they still have limitations. Augmented Reality applications test these devices to breaking point and without the correct coding techniques make the applications unresponsive and cumbersome.\n\nThis book gives a solution, which will enable you to build an effective application, and is accompanied by a complete working application and source code. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essential for anybody who is creating a multiple points of interest augmented reality application. It shows how to build this type of application efficiently and takes into consideration the devices limitations and processing capabilities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efc569bfbc7bf0b6794c6f2af9c443cdcfbac46","amp;dn":"Augmented+Reality+using+Appcelerator+Titanium+Starter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efc569bfbc7bf0b6794c6f2af9c443cdcfbac46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,252,86,155,251,199,191,11,103,148,198,242,175,156,68,60,220,251,172,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
