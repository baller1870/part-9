E-mail can be delivered to mobile\ndevices and can integrate nicely into a social media marketing strategy.\nStill, the same challenges that existed in the past apply to the new world of e-mail marketing. Namely, communicating with consumers is\neasy, but getting them to pay attention isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Every successful marketing strategy entails cutting through the clutter, and few places\nare more cluttered than the average consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s e-mail inbox.\nE-mail marketing represents an opportunity to experience both the thrill of increased customer loyalty and steady repeat business as well\nas the agony of bounced e-mail, unsubscribe requests, and spam complaints. Whether you find thrill or agony in your e-mail marketing\nstrategy depends on your ability to effectively deliver valuable and purposeful e-mails to prospects and customers who have a need for\nyour information.\nThis book combines time-tested marketing strategies with consumer preferences and best practices to help you develop and deliver e-mails\nthat your prospects and customers look forward to receiving. I explain how to apply basic business and marketing principles to your e-mail\nstrategy, such as maximizing your revenue and coming up with meaningful objectives. I also explain how to use e-mail templates to design\nprofessional-looking marketing e-mails and how to come up with relevant e-mail content to put into your designs.\nE-mail marketers are also subject to legal requirements, consumer mistrust, and Internet service providers (ISPs) blocking and filtering\nunwanted e-mails by the billions. This book shows you how to adhere to professional standards, improve your deliverability, and execute\nyour e-mail marketing strategy with current laws in mind.\nBecause your prospects and customers have to share their e-mail address for you to deliver valuable e-mails, this book explains how to\nbuild a quality e-mail list of subscribers who reward your e-mail marketing efforts with immediate action and outstanding return on\ninvestment (ROI). I include tactics that you can use immediately to start building your list as well as tips for obtaining permission and\ngetting your list subscribers to take action on your e-mails.\nE-mail integrates with other technologies, so this book shows you how to combine e-mail with social media and how to deliver e-mail to\nmobile devices. I also show you how to automate your e-mail marketing and target your e-mails more effectively with personalized databases\nand tracking.\nE-mail marketing doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t conclude with the successful delivery of an e-mail, so I also explain how you can find out whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening and\nclicking your e-mails. I include tips for using e-mail tracking reports and Web analytics to increase the number of your e-mail list\nsubscribers who regularly make purchases and refer your business to their friends and colleagues. I also explain how you can use e-mail to\nimprove search engine optimization, blogs, surveys, and other new technologies to deepen your customer relationships and extend your\nonline presence.\nAbout This Book\nE-Mail Marketing For Dummies answers your questions about e-mail marketing and gives you tips and ideas for executing the various steps\ninvolved in a successful e-mail marketing campaign.\nThis book isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t written to impress technically savvy intellectuals.
