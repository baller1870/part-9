Completely revised and updated, the Handbook of Manufacturing Engineering is now presented in four volumes. Keeping the same general format as the first edition, this second edition not only provides more information but makes it more accessible. Each individual volume narrows the focus while broadening the coverage, giving you immediate access to the information you need. Volume One, Product Design and Factory Development reveals how human factors deeply affect productivity in the workplace and why the modern manufacturing engineer must be well versed in these areas.\r\n\r\nEdited by Richard Crowson with contributions from experts in each field, the book considers historical data for anthropometry and explores the impact of injuries, product liability, and low productivity on product cost. The book sequentially outlines the basic concepts of reliability theory in six chapters along with commonly used statistical methods for evaluating component reliability. It covers rapid prototyping, explores the machine debugging and troubleshooting process, and devotes an entire chapter to computers and controllers.\r\n\r\nThe challenges presented by the fiercely technical world we live and work in are met by the manufacturing engineer. Companies can no longer afford to allow the manufacturing engineer to learn on the job. Therefore, the manufacturing engineer must gain as much knowledge from as many credible sources as possible. Covering the global picture of manufacturing, this book shows you how to successfully apply manufacturing engineering skills on the job","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:910e7da4bc7a3c230b2d457632824247dd67400a","amp;dn":"Product+Design+and+Factory+Development+-+Richard+Crowson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"910e7da4bc7a3c230b2d457632824247dd67400a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,14,125,164,188,122,60,35,11,45,69,118,50,130,66,71,221,103,64,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
