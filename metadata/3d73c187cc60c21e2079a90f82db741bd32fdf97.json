It was released in 2003 and charted at No. 14 on The Billboard 200# It was like a &quot;trip down memory lane&quot; as Jon Bon Jovi likes to put it. It has acoustic versions of many of Bon Jovi's biggest hits. Many of the 80's hard hitting chart-rockers are presented in a different light as soulful ballads. This Left Feels Right has sold 549,727 copies in the US (July 2007).\n\nThe 2003 rendition of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; was released as a single and also had a promotional video produced, which had the same format as &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive (Live version)&quot;, which was a single from the One Wild Night Live 1985Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001 album.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo.  \t\n1. \t&quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;   \t  3:43\n2. \t&quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;     \t  3:41\n3. \t&quot;Bad Medicine&quot;   \t\t  4:27\n4. \t&quot;It's My Life&quot;   \t \t  3:42\n5. \t&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;   \t  4:27\n6. \t&quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;        3:29\n7. \t&quot;Bed of Roses&quot;   \t\t  5:38\n8. \t&quot;Everyday&quot;   \t \t          3:45\n9. \t&quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot;   \t\t  5:27\n10. \t&quot;Keep the Faith&quot;   \t\t  4:12\n11. \t&quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;   \t  4:21\n12. \t&quot;Always&quot;   \t\t          4:18\n+ EXTRA\t- UK Limited Edition Bonus Tracks \t\t\n13. \t&quot;The Distance&quot; (Live) \t          5:54\n14. \t&quot;Joey&quot; (Live) \t                  5:33\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d73c187cc60c21e2079a90f82db741bd32fdf97","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+2003+-+This+Left+Feels+Right+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d73c187cc60c21e2079a90f82db741bd32fdf97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,115,193,135,204,96,194,30,32,121,169,15,130,219,116,27,211,47,223,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
