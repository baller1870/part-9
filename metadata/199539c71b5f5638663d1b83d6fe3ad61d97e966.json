So, it's not a surprise they achieved a great hit with &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot;. One has to go back to the time this film was made to realize what the creators of this comedy accomplished. This marked the first Hollywood film Mr. Wilder directed and his touch is everywhere. The movie stands the passage of time.\n\n&quot;The Major and the Minor&quot; works because of its two stars. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland were versatile actors who showed perfect chemistry in the film. Both do excellent work guided by the masterful hand of Billy Wilder.\n\nGinger Rogers' take on the little girl is fine. Of course, we, the viewers, know what is going on, but to the rest of the people she is nothing but the innocent, and young SuSu Applegate. Ray Milland, on the other hand, is proper throughout the film until the end, when the mystery is solved. Mr. Milland's timing is impeccable and he makes his Maj. Kirby a sort of absent minded &quot;uncle&quot; to the young SuSu.\n\nBilly Wilder showed a flair for this type of comedy. He got wonderful supporting performances from Rita Johnson and the disarming Diana Lynn, as the two sisters with different viewpoints on everything. Also, the opening sequence involving the incomparable Robert Benchley shows us a lecherous man who has hired the grown up Susan for a scalp treatment, that in his mind will lead into something else. Mr. Benchley and Ms. Rogers are hilarious.\n\nThis film established Billy Wilder as a director who went far and enjoyed a long career.\n\n(from imdb comments)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\nCast: Ginger Rogers, Ray Milland, Rita Johnson, Robert Benchley, Diana Lynn\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles included: Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and English (Cosed Caption)\nGenre: Comedy\nFormat: AVI / DivX\nSize: 1,09 GB\nRunning Time: ~96 min\n\nRip Specs:\n\nnot my rip \n\nFile Name .........................................: The.Major.And.The.Minor.1942.DVDRip.XViD.TINSeL.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,172,871,168 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:36:24\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1545 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.201 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 64 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:199539c71b5f5638663d1b83d6fe3ad61d97e966","amp;dn":"The+Major+and+The+Minor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"199539c71b5f5638663d1b83d6fe3ad61d97e966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,149,57,199,27,95,86,56,102,61,27,131,214,254,58,214,29,151,233,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
