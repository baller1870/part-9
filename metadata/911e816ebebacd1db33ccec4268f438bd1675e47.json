At each sacred site, you experience the past, then tap into the intense energy and use it to explore your own present and future. The final site is Mt. Shasta in Northern California where a great &quot;energy wave&quot; brings into your life what you desire and takes away what you want to release. 41 minutes.\n\nBECOME THE LIGHT Meditation is a unique &quot;transference&quot; session in which you explore what you will one day become -- a being of light exploring your potential in a highly evolved nonphysical realm. You'll return with the feelings of peace, light and love that you experience there. 23 minutes.\n\nMP3 - 320 kbps - CBR\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911e816ebebacd1db33ccec4268f438bd1675e47","amp;dn":"The+Wave+%26amp%3B+Become+the+Light+Meditation+Journeys+Dick+Sutphen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911e816ebebacd1db33ccec4268f438bd1675e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,30,129,110,190,186,205,29,179,60,206,196,38,143,67,139,209,103,94,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
