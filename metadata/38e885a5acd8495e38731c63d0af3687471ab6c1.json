In order to survive he tries to convince the Indians that he is not Portuguese (their enemies) but a friend of the French (their allies), and that his God would be very angry if they were to eat him.

He works in the colony for four years. When he is about to return to Europe to receive the due recognition and gold from the King of Portugal, Staden&amp;#039;s Indian slave disappears while fishing. Staden takes a canoe to search for the Indian in a nearby river, used by feuding Indian tribes for fishing. The rest is history, said to be a true story.
