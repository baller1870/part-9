In anticipation for the upcoming record, the band has premiered a new track/video for their first single, &quot;Bring It On Back&quot;\n\n\nOn &quot;Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, the Los Angeles quintet Ã¢â‚¬â€ Josh Todd (vocals), Keith Nelson (guitar), Stevie D. (guitar), Xavier Muriel (drums) and Kelly LeMieux (bass) Ã¢â‚¬â€ staunchly uphold the commandments of rock music with an arsenal of new anthems primed to explode on impact and teeming with riotous energy, sexy swagger, and primal chops intact. It's something that the boys have done since day one, but it's more necessary now than ever.\n\n&quot;There's been so much talk about how rock 'n' roll is dead and all of this bullshit,&quot; says Todd. &quot;The funny thing is, that's been going on since we put out our first record in 1999. We wanted to call the new album 'Rock 'N' Roll', because this is what we've been doing our whole lives. We focused on making a record that encompasses all of what we are. You get every flavor of BUCKCHERRY.&quot;\n\nThey rev up &quot;Rock 'N' Roll&quot; with the propulsive first single and opener &quot;Bring It On Back&quot;. From the jump, a robust guitar groove struts right alongside an unshakable refrain. It's got the band's signature hallmarks, but Todd pulled lyrical inspiration from a new source altogether. &quot;When I'm not on the road, I race Go-Karts for my hobby,&quot; he says. &quot;The song is really about racing. I had a driver named Kurt Busch in mind when I wrote the lyrics. They call him 'The Outlaw,' and he's a badass. It captures that intensity of racing and the mentality. I love it.&quot;\n\nFans can catch BUCKCHERRY live in concert this summer on their North American tour. Additional tour dates for July - September will be announced soon.\n\n&quot;Rock 'N' Roll&quot; track listing:\n\n01. Bring It On Back\n02. Tight Pants\n03. Wish To Carry On\n04.
