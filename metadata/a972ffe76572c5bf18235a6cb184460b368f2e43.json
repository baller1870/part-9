Nothing too adventurous about the song selection, including well-traveled items like &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot; and &quot;Kansas City,&quot; but Witherspoon sings them with ingratiating soul, reaching his peaks on his cover of &quot;Don't Let Go&quot; (perhaps better than the hit version by Roy Hamilton) and the late-night ambience of the title track. The CD reissue adds previously unissued alternate takes of four of the songs.\n\n\n\ntrack list:\n\n01. Money's Gettin' Cheaper [0:02:49.66]\n02. Grab Me A Freight [0:03:45.26]\n03.
