Author John Helfen covers sketching, part modeling, assemblies, and drawings. These tasks work in conjunction, allowing you to create parts and assemblies and document them in a way so that the manufacturing process proceeds faster and more efficiently.\nTopics include:\nNavigating drawings with the View Cube and other navigation tools\nSketching geometry\nDimensioning parts\nCreating parameters\nDrawing circles, squares, and other shapes\nCreating extrusions\nCreating and managing constraints in assemblies\nSetting basic drawing dimensions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc6eb449b31a7985055b06e8304fdd40fae8c95","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Autodesk+Inventor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc6eb449b31a7985055b06e8304fdd40fae8c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,198,235,68,155,49,167,152,80,85,176,110,131,4,253,212,15,174,140,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
