It's no wonder experts estimate that 75 percent of overeating is triggered by our emotions, not physical hunger. The good news is you can instead soothe yourself through dozens of mindful activities that are healthy for both body and mind.\nSusan Albers, author of Eating Mindfully, now offers 50 Ways to Soothe Yourself Without Food, a collection of mindfulness skills and practices for relaxing the body in times of stress and ending your dependence on eating as a means of coping with difficult emotions. You'll not only discover easy ways to soothe urges to overeat, you'll also learn how to differentiate emotion-driven hunger from healthy hunger. Reach for this book instead of the refrigerator next time you feel the urge to snack-these alternatives are just as satisfying!\n\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  google TEAM NANBAN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978d614d404f9a597088c021105d684d36d15454","amp;dn":"50+Ways+to+Soothe+Yourself+Without+Food+%5BTeam+Nanban%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978d614d404f9a597088c021105d684d36d15454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,141,97,77,64,79,154,89,112,136,192,33,16,93,104,77,54,209,84,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
