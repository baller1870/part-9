After the bloodshed at Lexington and Concord, EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s King George sent hundreds of ships westward to bottle up American harbors and prey on American shipping. Colonists had no force to defend their coastline and waterways until John Adams of Massachusetts proposed a bold solution: The Continental Congress should raise a navy.\n \nThe idea was mad. The Royal Navy was the mightiest floating arsenal in history, with a seemingly endless supply of vessels. More than a hundred of these were massive Ã¢â‚¬Å“ships of the line,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bristling with up to a hundred high-powered cannon that could level a city. The British were confident that His MajestyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warships would quickly bring the rebellious colonials to their knees.\n \nThey were wrong. Beginning with five converted merchantmen, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sailors became formidable warriors, matching their wits, skills, and courage against the best of the British fleet. Victories off American shores gave the patriots hopeÃ¢â‚¬â€victories led by captains such as John Barry, the fiery Irish-born giant; fearless Nicholas Biddle, who stared down an armed mutineer; and James Nicholson, the underachiever who finally redeemed himself with an inspiring display of coolness and bravery. Meanwhile, along the British coastline, daring raids by handsome, cocksure John Paul Jones and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dunkirk Pirate,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gustavus ConynghamÃ¢â‚¬â€who was captured and sentenced to hang but tunneled under his cell and escaped to fight againÃ¢â‚¬â€sent fear throughout England. The adventures of these men and others on both sides of the struggle rival anything from Horatio Hornblower or Lucky Jack Aubrey. In the end, these rebel sailors, from the quarterdeck to the forecastle, contributed greatly to American independence.\n \nMeticulously researched and masterfully told, Give Me a Fast Ship is a rousing, epic tale of war on the high seasÃ¢â‚¬â€and the definitive history of the American Navy during the Revolutionary War.\n\nINCLUDES NINE MAPS AND SIXTEEN PAGES OF FULL COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c428f044b399dab63781ed6a54ae0155bf64729","amp;dn":"Give+Me+a+Fast+Ship-+The+Continental+Navy+and+America%27s+Revoluti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c428f044b399dab63781ed6a54ae0155bf64729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,66,143,4,75,57,157,171,99,120,30,214,165,74,224,21,91,246,71,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
