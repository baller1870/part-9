It is because of their support that the book was reprinted three times since its first publication in \n2009.\nThe huge success of this book reflects appeal of its clear, unclustered presentation of the anatomical text supplemented by \nperfect simple line diagrams, which could be easily drawn by students in the exam and clinical correlations providing the \nanatomical, embryological, and genetic basis of clinical conditions seen in day-to-day life in clinical practice.\nBased on a large number of suggestions from students and fellow academicians, the text has been extensively revised. Many \nnew line diagrams and halftone figures have been added and earlier diagrams have been updated.\nI greatly appreciate the constructive suggestions that I received from past and present students and colleagues for \nimprovement of the content of this book. I do not claim to absolute originality of the text and figures other than the new mode\nof presentation and expression.\nOnce again, I whole heartedly thank students, teachers, and fellow anatomists for inspiring me to carry out the revision. I \nsincerely hope that they will find this edition more interesting and useful than the previous one. I would highly appreciate \ncomments and suggestions from students and teachers for further improvement of this book.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To learn from previous experience and change \naccordingly, makes you a successful man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nVishram Singh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47dadf31e44e5431ca3d0305baeff15cc2167cbd","amp;dn":"Textbook+of+Anatomy+Vol+I-+Upper+Limb%2C+2E-+Singh+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47dadf31e44e5431ca3d0305baeff15cc2167cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,218,223,49,228,78,84,49,202,61,3,5,186,239,241,92,194,22,124,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
