All audiobook CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were from the public library and all cover &amp; folder art from the web. All photos were edited and resized for this project. I did this in my free time, as this is not something I do as a hobby. Any complaints will go unacknowledged by me. Any compliments will be seen, appreciated, but will go unacknowledged as well. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what I did.\n\nAll CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s were ripped with AudioGrabber using Lame 3.99 as the encoder at a bitrate of 64. All of these CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had up to 20 files per book, yet each book only had 4, 5 or 6 chapters. I used MP3 Splitter &amp; Joiner Pro to join the individual files into chapters. I realize that they were in nice little 2 to 5 minute files, which some like for easier bookmarking, however with 60 books, there were over 900 files and it was too difficult to organize and keep track of. So now, each individual MP3 file is a chapter lasting 10 to 25 minutes. I also used Audacity to further remove some of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“spamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the end of each book. Once this process was completed, the tagging process began. This was a labor of love! I used Tag&amp;Rename to edit all fields. I used Amazon &amp; americangirl.wikiacom for all of my information. All 60 books are tagged in the same format. Each Collection has 6 books that should be played in a specific order. I ensured the track numbers were tagged accordingly. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“yearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the tags field is the original year the paperback book was first published, not the year the audiobook was made. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Looking BackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ chapters have been incorporated into the last chapters of each book that has them. I continually tweaked the tags so they displayed in a logical format on my daughters iPod and on my iPad. Again, this was a labor of love. Once downloaded, you will be able to just drag the main folder into iTunes (or whatever program you prefer) and you will have nearly 80 hours of quality audio books for your children to listen to, with logically displayed text and the proper folder art for each individual book!\n\nSo, you may be asking why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in 1 large ZIP file? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because I wanted to keep the integrity of this collection intact for a while. No partial torrent seeds; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s either all or none! I used 7zip to compress it. This is a Windows program, but there is MAC version of it floating around (Google it!) You can use WINRAR or WINZIP to open it as well, just change the extension accordingly.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inside the ZIP:\n\nAn American Girl Story Book Collection (10 AudioBooks Collections)\n\nAddy's Story Collection\nFelicity's Story Collection\nJosafina's Story Collection\nJulie's Story Collection\nKaya's Story Collection\nKirsten's Story Collection\nKit's Story Collection\nMolly's Story Collection\nRebecca's Story Collection\nSamantha's Story Collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54a558499f1b356777fe712fc6b5666f2c67544b","amp;dn":"An+American+Girl+Story+Book+Collection+%2810+AudioBook+Collections","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54a558499f1b356777fe712fc6b5666f2c67544b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,165,88,73,159,27,53,103,119,254,113,47,198,181,102,111,44,103,84,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
