Recorded in concert with Reed's crack road band at the peak of their form, Rock N Roll Animal offered a set of his most anthemic songs (most dating from his days with the Velvet Underground) in arrangements that presented his lean, effective melodies and street-level lyrics in their most user-friendly form (or at least as user friendly as an album with a song called &quot;Heroin&quot; can get). Early-'70s arena rock bombast is often the order of the day, but guitarists Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter use their six-string muscle to lift these songs up, not weigh them down, and with Reed's passionate but controlled vocals riding over the top, &quot;Sweet Jane,&quot; &quot;White Light/White Heat,&quot; and &quot;Rock 'n' Roll&quot; finally sound like the radio hits they always should have been. Reed would rarely sound this commercial again, but Rock N Roll Animal proves he could please a crowd when he had to.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdf6add2add653f46fe9bb40cf96bf5c426994c","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed+-+Rock+n+Roll+Animal+%282006%29+Japan+Mini+LP+Box+FLAC+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdf6add2add653f46fe9bb40cf96bf5c426994c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,223,106,221,42,221,101,63,70,254,155,180,12,249,107,245,196,38,153,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
