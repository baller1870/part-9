There, they find an old enemy has overtaken the great city with the help of Visorak--robotic spiders that can quickly encase anything or anybody in near-indestructible webs. The Toa undergo a bizarre metamorphosis while sealed within strange cocoons, and emerge as clunky-looking machines made up of mismatched parts. Though horrified, they find that they also possess some new powers, which prove essential for their subsequent journey to restore Metru Nui--and themselves. This delightful Bionicle installment is probably easily accessible for any viewer unfamiliar with the series to date.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f005e9500ff814f74c5d9958417cc62c0d27ef","amp;dn":"Bionicle+3+-+Web+of+Shadows+%5B2005%5D+DVDRip+%5BDXO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f005e9500ff814f74c5d9958417cc62c0d27ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,240,5,233,80,15,248,20,247,76,93,153,88,65,124,198,44,13,39,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
