To illuminate these changing times, Forster throws together three vastly dissimilar classes of people: the SchlegelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Helen and MargaretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½educated, compassionate and independently wealthy; the WilcoxesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½nouveau riche Empire builders; and Leonard Bast, an ambitious but struggling bank clerk. As these three groups move in and out of each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worlds, disasters and discoveries ensue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b69d2f9b6f99b2d1e36216c9b23a9df6584da6","amp;dn":"HOWARDS+END+-+E.M.+Forster.+John+Franklyn-Robbins+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b69d2f9b6f99b2d1e36216c9b23a9df6584da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,182,157,47,155,111,153,178,209,227,98,22,201,178,58,157,246,88,77,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
