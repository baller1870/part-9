Broken Brains\nDr Michael Mosley concludes his series exploring the brutal history of experimental psychology by looking at how experiments on abnormal brains have revealed the workings of the normal brain. He meets remarkable individuals like Karen, who suffered from a rare condition - alien hand syndrome - which meant that one of her hands constantly attacked her. And Julia, who seems to have recovered from her stroke - until experiments reveal she is unable to recall the name of any object. Michael explores the case of an amnesiac known for years only by his initials, HM, who became the most studied individual in the history of psychology and whose extraordinary case opened a window on how our memory works. He visits the multi-million dollar centre which has been set up since HM died to map his unique brain down to the level of an individual neuron.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xhgkd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xhgkd&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1400 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 628 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: PDTV\n\nSRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bafdaf5f0b8858caf86effe1db3b958e7cded93b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Brain+A+Secret+History+3of3+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bafdaf5f0b8858caf86effe1db3b958e7cded93b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,253,175,95,11,136,88,202,248,110,255,225,219,59,149,142,124,222,217,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
