SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to keep 710 alive but she never wants him to know how she suffered for him. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the reason for her mission in life - freeing others like him.\n\nTrue has a new life working with the NSO to rescue his people. A good life, until he encounters a dying woman - the female who betrayed him. True should feel gratified that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally going to pay for her crimes, but she claims to be a victim, too. He is still irresistibly drawn to the pretty little human who touched his heart and made him want her. When he clasps her hand to offer comfort, his instincts kick in and True will fight everyone to protect her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0366a085d8cb32622b224229045f468e9ce3f77","amp;dn":"Laurann+Dohner+-+True","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0366a085d8cb32622b224229045f468e9ce3f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,54,106,8,93,140,179,38,34,178,36,34,144,69,244,104,233,206,63,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
