The Grammis-nominated album was widely-praised and increased their popularity significantly. Their second album, and major label debut, Infestissumam was released in 2013 and debuted at number one in their home country.\n\nGhost are easily recognizable due to their eccentric on-stage presence (five of the group's six members wear hooded robes, while the vocalist appears in a skull mask and a cardinal outfit) and highly secretive nature of their identities, with the members being referred to as &quot;Nameless Ghouls&quot;. Musically, the band is often compared to groups such as Black Sabbath, Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, Mercyful Fate and Kyuss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32263378ad63f0be889804cac3f4eabe4855f45","amp;dn":"Ghost+BC+Live+%40+Turner+Hall+Milwaukee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32263378ad63f0be889804cac3f4eabe4855f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,34,99,55,138,214,63,11,232,137,128,76,172,63,78,171,228,133,95,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
