Later, during sleep, while out of body on the other side, Master teachers began to prepare you for a physical journey to the Himalayas.&quot;\n\nThe Temple of Light is a mind-movie meditation like nothing you've ever experienced. For 65 minutes, you become the central character on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nProduced with incredible three-dimensional sound effects, you journey to Kathmandu, where you meet a Sherpa guide who leads you deep into the Himalayas. Along the way, you meet various travelers who ask soul-searching questions you'll answer in your mind. The travel, the mountains, and the people become real to you. People in the teahouses talk to you, ask questions, and provide messages the Masters have asked them to relay. Eventually, you reach The Temple of Light, where you'll meet the Masters, experience a chakra initiation, and be offered the opportunity to have all your questions answered.\n\nThese Meditation Journeys are divided into multi-tracks, making them easy to listen to one at a time.\n\nDick Sutphen's Teachings &amp; Self-Awareness Processing in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“JourneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Format. By dividing the meditation journey into multi-tracks, you can experience it any way you desire. As examples: 1. You can skip the body relaxation/altered-state induction while driving and simply listen to the story. participating to any degree you desire when instructed to consider a particular concept. 2. If you don't want to meditate for the full length of the CD/audio program, you can set your player to play onlyr Tracks 1 through 5 and the awakening track. The next time you do the meditation set your player to play Track 1 (relaxation) plus Track 6 through the end to finish the journey. If you like a particular portion of the journey, you can re-experience it as often as you like.\n\nMP3 - 320 kbps - CBR\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa01782f5edf4312b59fc9562db69ac70e4dd428","amp;dn":"Temple+of+Light+Meditation+Journey+with+Dick+Sutphen+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa01782f5edf4312b59fc9562db69ac70e4dd428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,1,120,47,94,223,67,18,181,159,201,86,45,182,154,199,14,77,212,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
