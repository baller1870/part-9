We all fail. And we all want to learn from our failures. But learning from failure doesn't happen automatically. It requires very specific emotional and rational skills. You can learn those skills--from this book. Drawing on leading-edge research with hundreds of failing and successful entrepreneurs, Dr. Dean A. Shepherd offers powerful strategies for managing the emotions generated by failure--so failure becomes less devastating, learning happens faster, and you grow as much as possible from the experience. Shepherd shows how to clarify why you failed, so you can walk away with insights you can actually use...how to eliminate &quot;secondary&quot; stresses that aggravate failure or make it more likely...how to master the self-compassion you deserve in times of trouble...and a whole lot more.
