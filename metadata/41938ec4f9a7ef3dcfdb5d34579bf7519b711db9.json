In addition to taking pictures of the world at large - the World's Fair of 1900, the then new and controversial Eiffel Tower, the streets, shops and people of Paris, as well as Medan, where Zola had a country house - Zola soon became fascinated by the art of portraiture - the book includes pictures of his friends, of his wife and his mistress and of his children. Paris at the turn of the century, Renoir-like images of the French countryside and pictures of Zola's self-exile in England are also included. Francois Emile-Zola, Emile's grandson, has provided extensive letters as well as Zola's diary entries, giving an intimate view and flavour of the period.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41938ec4f9a7ef3dcfdb5d34579bf7519b711db9","amp;dn":"Zola+-+Photographer+%28Photography+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41938ec4f9a7ef3dcfdb5d34579bf7519b711db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,147,142,196,249,167,239,61,207,219,93,52,87,155,247,81,155,113,29,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
