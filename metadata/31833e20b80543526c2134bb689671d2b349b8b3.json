Made by O'Connor flight school, it covers all aspects of SIV and advanced acrobatics.\n\nThis video should by no means be used to train yourself - you can learn from it but you MUST ATTEND PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT COURSES BEFORE ATTEMPTING THESE MANEUVERS ON YOUR OWN!!!\n\nEnleau and Ann O'Connor put a lot of hard work into making this DVD, so if you like it please BUY THE DVD at www.brokentoeacro.com . These people deserve it. The website of O'Connor flight school is at www.oconnorflightschool.com .\n\nIf you want to do some SIV maneuvers or Acro, this is a good way to get to know a lot about them. But it is by no means a substitute for real-life training: you can't do all maneuvers right just by watching this video. So always get professional training.\n\n\nIT ACTUALLY INCLUDES A FULLY WORKING DVD MENU!\n\nWhat I did was: I ripped all parts off the DVD then put them in a separate folder and renamed them so you can access them directly. I then included screenshots of the DVD menus, after that I created HTML files with a clickmap for each DVD menu. The whole thing is not directory sensitive so it should work wherever you place the file. This emulates a real DVD menu and works just as good!\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I know, I'm the first one to emulate a DVD menu this way. If you like it, show your friends and ask other uploaders to do it too!\n\nThe quality is unsurpassed: 1600kb/s, two pass encoding, same audio as original dvd but bigger non-anamorphic resolution: 848*480. I can't tell the difference between this and the DVD, especially since the menu is included.\n\nIf you don't know how to play .mkv files, use GOMplayer: the best player around for any format you can imagine. Download it at www.gomlab.com .\n\n\nSOARiNGBiRD wishes you long glides and tight lines! Oh, and if you like it, don't hesitate to leave a thanks and then seed!\n\n\nSpecs:\nFormat            : Matroska\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 600 Kbps\nAspect            : 848 x 480 (1.767) at 23.976 fps\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 320 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nTotal size        : 2,59GB\nTotal runtime     : 2 hours 40 minutes\n\nAll aspects covered:\n\nSIV Maneuvers\n - Full Frontal Deflations\n - Asymmetric Deflations\n - B-Lines and Descent Techniques\n - Pitch Oscillations\n - Riser Twists\n - Full Stalls\nAcro Maneuvers\n - Round Spirals\n - Asymmetric Spirals\n - Wingovers\n - Reversals\n - The Sat\n - Spins &amp; Helicopters\nSpecial Features\n - Welcome to OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor Flight School\n - On Tow\n - Credits &amp; Outtakes\n - MasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tips \n     Ground Spirals\n     SatBack\n     Spin Variations ...and More!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31833e20b80543526c2134bb689671d2b349b8b3","amp;dn":"Broken+Toe+Acro+paragliding+instructional+DVD+%28SIV%2C+Acro%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31833e20b80543526c2134bb689671d2b349b8b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,131,62,32,184,5,67,82,108,33,52,187,104,150,113,210,179,73,184,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
