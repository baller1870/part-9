He has decided that everything has to be made by hand from his woodland, and if it not, then it has to be sourced from somebody else's rubbish. Together with a hardy band of friends and experts, Kevin is going to reuse, repurpose and recycle almost all the materials for his bold building in rural Somerset. A place where he can unhook himself from the madness of modern life and live in a different way. Can a simple, more creative life make you happier?\n\n\n\n\n2)  Part 2 \nNow that Kevin's cabin's glorious shingled shell has been finished, the next major task is to make it both habitable and magnificent. Kevin needs a solid, durable floor, a window to let in natural light and most important of all, the heart of the home, a fire for heat. As Kevin wants to reuse, repurpose and recycle as much of his building as possible, he decides to turn a 1930s heavy steel safe into a wood burning stove. But he has to use the dangerous tool of the 70s bank robber, a thermic lance, to do it. Kevin tries to build a cheese floor, an ancient Viking invention that uses milk. And then for perhaps his toughest test yet, Kevin attempts to make glass from scratch using sand. To celebrate the next stage of the building, Kevin's friends burn a wicker man, a pagan tradition, to scare away any vagrant woodland ghosts that might haunt the new cabin.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1944 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7de86bfc4d8bdf2686ba50faa24649485e70b242","amp;dn":"Ch4+Kevin+McClouds+Man+Made+Home+2of4+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7de86bfc4d8bdf2686ba50faa24649485e70b242","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,232,107,252,77,139,223,38,134,186,80,250,162,70,73,72,94,112,178,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
