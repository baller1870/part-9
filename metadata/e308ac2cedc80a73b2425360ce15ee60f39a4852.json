This workbook offers a quick reference for each character type and fill-in blanks to help you build an effective character. By assigning each of your primary and secondary characters a personality type, you can create a sound psychological basis for their motivations, actions, and responses. Choose your hero and antagonist carefully. Make sure they would behave the way you want them to or are suited to the challenge before them. They could be the same personality type but on opposite ends of the healthy spectrum. They could be complete opposites. It is important to be aware of those that are action-oriented versus those that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Are they strong or poor communicators? Are they introverts or extraverts? Use the traits that work best for the character you have in mind. The details about each personality type will give you an intimate understanding of what makes your characters tick. Intimate knowledge of your characters helps you portray them realistically to your audience. When your characters feel real, your readers care what happens to them. When the conflicts and solutions feel real, they keep reading.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e308ac2cedc80a73b2425360ce15ee60f39a4852","amp;dn":"Story+Building+Blocks-+Build+A+Cast+Workbook+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e308ac2cedc80a73b2425360ce15ee60f39a4852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,8,172,44,237,200,10,115,178,66,83,96,206,21,238,96,243,154,72,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
