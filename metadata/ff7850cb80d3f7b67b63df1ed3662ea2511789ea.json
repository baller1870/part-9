Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7850cb80d3f7b67b63df1ed3662ea2511789ea","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+5+Pure+Cardio+%26amp%3B+Cardio+Abs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7850cb80d3f7b67b63df1ed3662ea2511789ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,120,80,203,128,211,247,182,123,99,223,30,211,102,46,162,81,23,137,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
