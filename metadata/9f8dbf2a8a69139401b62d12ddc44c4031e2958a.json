They became popular with their first two albums, Skid Row and Slave to the Grind, which are often considered their best works to date. Their 1995 follow-up, Subhuman Race was also critically acclaimed. Skid Row's latest albums, Thickskin and Revolutions per Minute, came out in 2003 and 2006 respectively with mixed to negative reception.\n\nContents Not a whole lot since this release is only an EP.
