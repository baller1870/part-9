The Handbook of Alternative Fuel Technologies offers a thorough guide to the science and available technologies for developing alternatives to petroleum fuel sources and petrochemical feedstocks. This handbook focuses on the different intermediates and raw material options that can generate energy output and products equivalent to conventional petroleum sources. \n\nIt presents short-term options for clean alternative energy sources that complement the development of long-term sustainable energy infrastructures. Detailing the chemical processes for each technology, the text assesses the environmental impact, benefits, and performance of the various processes and fuel products. It also summarizes processing and transportation issues, safety concerns, regulations, and other practical considerations associated with alternative fuels. After presenting a global energy overview, the book describes clean and alternative methods of producing liquid fuels, crude oil, syngas, and methanol from coal, coal slurry, natural gas, resids, oil sand bitumen, and oil shale. It details the chemical reaction mechanisms, biological processes, and unit operations for converting corn, lignocellulosic materials, and biomass into alcoholic fuels. \n\n\nIt also covers the processes and thermodynamics of converting various waste materials into energy. The final chapters discuss the science, benefits, and applications of geothermal energy, nuclear energy, and fuel cells. Blending up-to-date technical information with current trend analyses and feasible implementation strategies, the Handbook of Alternative Fuel Technologies provides an ideal foundation for scientists, engineers, and policymakers interested in developing alternative energy sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9455dde5668641352d9ed611584b6ea70008a71f","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Alternative+Fuel+Technologies+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9455dde5668641352d9ed611584b6ea70008a71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,85,221,229,102,134,65,53,45,158,214,17,88,75,110,167,0,8,167,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
