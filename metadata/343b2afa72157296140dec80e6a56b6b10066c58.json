What's that all about? Skiing is about that surge of adrenaline and stoke, not about feeling the hate of the image police.\n\nBut at Matchstick, we are stoked and we have to let it out. We have thrown caution to the wind and dared to put the stoke back in skiing. The result is &quot;CLAIM, The Greatest Ski Movie... EVER!&quot;. A truly epic film shot in the most amazing locations, featuring the best and boldest skiers in the world today: Mark Abma, Jon Olsson, Shane McConkey, Eric Hjorleifson and more.\n\n\n\n---ENJOY AND SEED!---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343b2afa72157296140dec80e6a56b6b10066c58","amp;dn":"Claim.DVDRip.XviD-Morphy%5BSki+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343b2afa72157296140dec80e6a56b6b10066c58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,59,42,250,114,21,114,150,20,13,236,128,230,165,107,107,16,6,108,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
