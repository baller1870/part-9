Now, we meet the actor who is every bit as loveable as the character he plays on TV. In this revealing collection of essays written in his irreverent, hilarious, and self-deprecating voice, Kunal Nayyar traces his journey from a little boy in New Delhi who mistakes an awkward first kiss for a sacred commitment, gets nosebleeds chugging Coca-Cola to impress other students, and excels in the sport of badminton, to the confident, successful actor on the set of TVâ€™s most-watched sitcom since Friends.\r\n\r\nGoing behind the scenes of The Big Bang Theory and into his personal experiences, Kunal introduces readers to the people who helped him grow, such as his James Bond-loving, mustachioed father who taught him the most important lessons in life: Treat a beggar as you would a king. There are two sides to every story. A smile goes a long way. And, when in doubt, use a spreadsheet. Kunal also walks us through his college years in Portland, where he takes his first sips of alcohol and learns to let loose with his French, 6â€™8â€ gentle-giant roommate, works his first-ever job for the universityâ€™s housekeeping department cleaning toilets for minimum wage, and begins a series of romantic exploits that go just about as well as they would for Raj. (That is, until he meets and marries a former Miss India in an elaborate seven-day event that we get to experience in a chapter titled â€œMy Big Fat Indian Wedding.â€)\r\n\r\nFull of heart, but never taking itself too seriously, this witty and often inspiring collection of underdog tales follows a young man as he traverses two continents in search of a dream, along the way transcending culture and language (and many, many embarrassing incidents) to somehow miraculously land the role of a lifetime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fee4631d417551e936fc701cacdffe09e94b6dc","amp;dn":"Kunal+Nayyar+-+Yes%2C+My+Accent+Is+Real+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fee4631d417551e936fc701cacdffe09e94b6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,238,70,49,212,23,85,30,147,111,199,1,202,205,255,224,158,148,182,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
