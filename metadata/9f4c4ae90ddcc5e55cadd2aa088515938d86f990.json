Rather than the Fantastic Four, the series focused on the new Future Foundation created by Reed Richards.\n\nThe first 11 issues are under the 'cape' of Fantastic Four. After issue 11, the series returned to it's original name; Fantastic Four.\n\nHowever this series continued as well, and stands on it's own from issue 12 and on. The series lasted until issue 23, after which a second volume of FF with a new number one started.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4c4ae90ddcc5e55cadd2aa088515938d86f990","amp;dn":"FF+%28001+-+023%29+%28Digital%29+%282011%29+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4c4ae90ddcc5e55cadd2aa088515938d86f990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,76,74,233,13,220,197,229,92,173,210,170,8,133,21,147,141,134,249,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
