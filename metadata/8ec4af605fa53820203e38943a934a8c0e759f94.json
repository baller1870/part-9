Although life has existed for millions of years, only in the past century-and-a-half have we begun to use science to explore the ancestral roots of our own species. The search for the ultimate answer has taken a number of twists and turns, with careers made and broken along the way. APE TO MAN is the story of the quest to find the origins of the human race - a quest that spanned more than 150 years of obsessive searching.\n\nThe search for the origins of humanity is a story of bones and the tales they tell. It was in 1856 that the first bones of an extinct human ancestor were encountered, unearthed by a crew of unskilled laborers digging for limestone in Western Europe. The find, which would be known as Neanderthal Man, was seeing the light of day for the first time in more than 40,000 years. At the time, the concept of a previous human species was virtually unthinkable. Yet just a few years later, Charles Darwin&amp;#039;s work The Origin of Species first broached the subject of evolution, and by the end of the nineteenth century, it had become the hottest topic of the age. Adventurers had embarked on the search for the Missing Link, the single creature that represented the evolutionary leap from apes to humans.\n\nScreenshots\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.3\nVideo Bitrate: 1569 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x368\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.870:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 1:29:55\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.07GB\nSubtitles: No subs\nRipped by: jvt40\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Ape Man\n* Lascaux - The Prehistory of Art\n* Neanderthal (Discovery)\n* Neanderthal (Horizon)\n* The Ape that Took Over the World\n* Search for the Ultimate Survivor - The Mystery of Us\n* Walking with Cavemen\n* Skull Wars: The Missing Link\n* Stone Age Columbus\n\n2) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Ape_to_Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec4af605fa53820203e38943a934a8c0e759f94","amp;dn":"History.Channel.Ape.to.Man.DVB.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec4af605fa53820203e38943a934a8c0e759f94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,196,175,96,95,165,56,32,32,62,56,148,58,147,74,140,14,117,159,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
