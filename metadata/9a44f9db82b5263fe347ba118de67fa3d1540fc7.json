From the raw energy of their made-in-a-day debut \nLP Please Please Me through the technical genius of the \nseminal Sgt Pepper to the last album they recorded, the \nfinely crafted Abbey Road, the Beatles sustained an \nunsurpassed level of creativity in the recording studio. \nThey used the Abbey Road recording studio in ways no studio \nhad been used before, and in the process they completely \nrevolutionized popular music.\n\nThe photos, stories, and recording details in The Beatles: \nRecording Sessions open up this magic laboratory where the \nBeatles created the sounds that changed the world. For every \nday the Beatles ever laid down a track in the recording \nstudio, this book details what songs they were recording, \nwho was present, how many takes were done, what special \neffects or techniques were employed, and any thing unusual \nthat happened that day. Here are the Beatles as you've never \nseen them before: John Lennon asking to be suspended from \nthe ceiling with a rope around his waist and spun over a \nmicrophone to achieve a unique vocal effect; George Harrison \nrunning around the studio holding a flaming ash trayover his \nhead while Paul McCartney records the vocals of &quot;Helter \nSkelter&quot;; and rock- steady Ringo, after one of his rare \nfoul-ups, grousing &quot;We all make mistakes.&quot;\n\nEMI Records, the Beatles' British record label, has made \navailable to author Mark Lewisohn its unpublished \ndocumentation for every recording session the Beatles ever \ndid, and has allowed him to listen to the hundreds of hours \nof alternative takes and unreleased tracks in their archive. \nFrom these sources, in combination with interviews with Paul \nMcCartney and the producers, engineers, session musicians, \nand others who were in the studio with the band, Lewisohn \nhas created a thorough, fascinating, and definitive record \nof the Beatles at work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a44f9db82b5263fe347ba118de67fa3d1540fc7","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+Recording+Sessions+by+Mark+Lewisohn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a44f9db82b5263fe347ba118de67fa3d1540fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,68,249,219,130,181,38,63,227,71,186,17,141,230,127,163,209,84,15,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
