Some see it as a paean to peace; others call it a violent mandate for worldwide Islamic supremacy. How can one book lead to such dramatically different conclusions? The truth is, not many Westerners know whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the Koran, since so few have actually read itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even among the legions of politicians, diplomats, analysts, and editorial writers who vehemently insist that the Koran preaches tolerance.\n\nNow, New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer unveils the mysteries lying behind this powerful book, guiding listeners through the controversies surrounding the KoranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s origins and its most contentious passages. Stripping out the obsolete debates, Spencer focuses on the KoranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decrees toward Jews, Christians, and other infidels, explaining how they were viewed in MuhammadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time, what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve supposedly done wrong, and most important, what the Koran has in store for them.\n\nRobert Spencer is the director of JihadWatch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center. He is the author of nine books on Islam and Jihad, a weekly columnist for Human Events and the Web site Front Page Magazine, and has led numerous seminars for the U.S. Military and intelligence communities.\n\n12 mp3 files totaling 8 hours [Unabridged]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ae43ba488daeaef92134258297aadd5cf6999b7","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Infidel%5C%27s+Guide+to+the+Koran-Robert+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ae43ba488daeaef92134258297aadd5cf6999b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,228,59,164,136,218,234,239,146,19,66,88,41,122,173,213,207,105,153,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
