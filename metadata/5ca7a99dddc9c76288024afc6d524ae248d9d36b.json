More than eight million North Americans choose to exclude meat from their diets, and an additional twenty-five million rarely eat meat. Many of these individuals consume no animal products whatsoever. Why do these vegans and vegetarians choose to forgo steak, yogurt, or ice cream? Most commonly, they cite increasing and maintaining personal health. Add to this the steadily growing population of health and fitness enthusiasts who adopt plant-based diets temporarily to meet their performance goals, plus those looking to vegan diets for weight loss, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a full-blown diet and lifestyle movement quickly expanding across the globe.\n\nVegan Vitality is a comprehensive active-living guide and cookbook for current and aspiring vegans and vegetarians interested in making regular physical activity a part of their lives.
