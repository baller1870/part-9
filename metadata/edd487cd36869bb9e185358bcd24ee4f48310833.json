Just her face. At least that was how it appeared...\n\n\nOn a perfect summer evening in 1954, sixteen-year-old Nancy Denton walked into the woods of her hometown of Whytesburg, Mississippi. She was never seen again.\n\n\nTwo decades on, Sheriff John Gaines witnesses a harrowing discovery. A young woman has been unearthed from the riverbank, her body perfectly preserved, yet she bears evidence of a brutal ritualistic killing. Nancy has come home at last, but her return does not bring closure to her family, nor to the townsfolk of Whytesburg.\n\n\nAlready haunted by his experiences in Vietnam, Gaines must now stretch his abilities to the limit, pushing himself ever closer to breaking point. What really happened to the beautiful and vivacious Nancy? And why do her friends refuse to talk?\n\n\nAs Gaines closes in on the truth, he is forced to not only confront his own demons, but to unearth secrets that have long remained hidden. And that truth, so much darker than he could ever have imagined, may be the one thing that finally destroys him.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21359296-the-devil-and-the-river?from_search=true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21359296-the-devil-and-the-river?from_search=true&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edd487cd36869bb9e185358bcd24ee4f48310833","amp;dn":"The+Devil+and+the+River-+RJ+Ellory+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edd487cd36869bb9e185358bcd24ee4f48310833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,212,135,205,54,134,155,185,225,133,53,139,205,36,238,79,72,49,8,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
