It almost defines the character of the US. But the Earth is running out of frontiers fast.\n\nIn Brian Clegg's The Final Frontier we discover the massive challenges that face explorers, both human and robotic, to uncover the current and future technologies that could take us out into the galaxy and take a voyage of discovery where no one has gone beforeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but one day someone will. In 2003, General Wesley Clark set the nation a challenge to produce the technology that would enable new pioneers to explore the galaxy. That challenge is tough Ã¢â‚¬â€ the greatest weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever faced. But taking on the final frontier does not have to be a fantasy.\n\nIn a time of recession, escapism is always popular Ã¢â‚¬â€ and what greater escape from the everyday can there be than the chance of leaving EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bounds and exploring the universe? With a rich popular culture heritage in science fiction movies, books and TV shows, this is a subject that entertains and informs in equal measure.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nePub: 229 pages\nPublisher: St. Martin's Press; First Edition edition (August 19, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1250039436\nISBN-13: 978-1250039439\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e37d4605a78a44eabbe63684d64ce49268dcd34","amp;dn":"Final+Frontier%3A+The+Pioneering+Science+and+Technology+of+Explori","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e37d4605a78a44eabbe63684d64ce49268dcd34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,55,212,96,90,120,164,78,171,190,99,104,77,100,206,73,38,141,205,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
