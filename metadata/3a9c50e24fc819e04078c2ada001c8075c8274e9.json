This book will help you build a solid foundation of understanding, beginning with core relational database concepts and continuing to reinforce those concepts with real-world T-SQL query applications.\n\nThis book will help you to learn:\n- How T-SQL provides you with the means to create tools for managing databases of different size, scope, and purpose\n- Various programming techniques that use views, user-defined functions, and stored procedures\n- Ways to optimize query performance\n- How to create databases that will be an essential foundation to applications you develop later\n\nEach section of this book organizes topics into logical groups so the book can be read cover-to-cover or can be used as a reference guide for specific topics.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nBeginning T-SQL with MicrosoftÃ‚Â® SQL ServerÃ‚Â® 2005 and 2008\n\nNearly all business applications read, store, and manipulate data stored in relational databases. If you use Microsoft SQL Server in any way, you need to learn and use T-SQL,?MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful implementation of the ANSI-standard SQL database query language.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n- How to add, modify, and remove records\n- How to query multiple tables\n- Ways to use views to modify data\n- How to create tools for managing databases using T-SQL\n- T-SQL programming techniques using views, user-defined functions, and stored procedures\n- Methods for optimizing?query performance\n- How to use?SQL Server Reporting Services to visualize T-SQL query results\n\nThis book is for beginning SQL Server developers and administrators who need to learn how to use T-SQL. Basic familiarity with relational databases and a general understanding of basic SQL functions is necessary.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 672 pages\nPublisher: Wrox (December 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470257032\nISBN-13: 978-0470257036","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9c50e24fc819e04078c2ada001c8075c8274e9","amp;dn":"Beginning+T-SQL+With+Microsoft+SQL+Server+2005+And+2008+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9c50e24fc819e04078c2ada001c8075c8274e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,156,80,226,79,200,25,224,64,120,194,173,160,1,200,7,92,130,116,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
