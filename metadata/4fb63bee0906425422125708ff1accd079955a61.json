It was first featured on the band's 1975 album Fleetwood Mac.\n\nNicks has said that she wrote this song while she was contemplating going back to school or continuing on with guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Her band [JZ] had been dropped by Polydor Records and she and Buckingham were not getting along. She wrote the song while visiting Aspen, Colorado sitting in someone's living room &quot;looking out at the Rocky Mountains pondering the avalanche of everything that had come crashing down on us...at that moment, my life truly felt like a landslide in many ways.&quot;\n\nFleetwood Mac is the tenth album by the British/American band Fleetwood Mac, released in 1975. It was the band's second eponymous album; the first being their 1968 album. This is the first album to feature both Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as another vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band late in 1974.\n\nThe album peaked at number one on the Billboard charts, and set a record for most weeks on the chart before reaching the top position (broken in 1989, when Paula Abdul's Forever Your Girl took 64 weeks to reach #1). It sold 4.5 million copies and launched three Top Twenty singles: &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, the last two falling just short of the Top Ten, both at #11. Its sales as of 2009 in the USA have reached 13xplatinum by the RIAA.\n\nUntil the release of this album, Fleetwood Mac's albums generally sold around 300,000 - 350,000 copies a piece. This album helped launch them as musical superstars with an almost constant radio presence (which would be continued with their even more popular follow-up, Rumours). In 2003, the album was ranked #183 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn Britain, the album was initially largely ignored and the first three singles lifted from the album failed to chart, therefore, generating limited interest in the album and the new line-up of the band. Only &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; charted on the UK Singles Chart and it reached #40. With the massive success of Rumours in 1977 and interest in the band re-ignited, Fleetwood Mac was issued again in 1978, along with the re-release of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; which peaked just outside the Top 40 at #46. The album eventually peaked at #23 on the UK Album Chart but was a prelude to a run of hugely successful albums for the band in Britain, including four multi-platinum #1's: Rumours, Tusk, Tango in the Night and Behind the Mask.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fb63bee0906425422125708ff1accd079955a61","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+Landslide++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fb63bee0906425422125708ff1accd079955a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,182,59,238,9,6,66,84,34,18,87,8,255,26,204,208,121,149,90,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
