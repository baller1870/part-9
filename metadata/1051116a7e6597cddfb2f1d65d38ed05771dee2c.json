However, J. R. R. Tolkien described Welsh as the 'senior language of the men of Britain'. Visitors from outside Wales may be intrigued by the existence of Welsh and will want to find out how a language which has, for at least fifteen hundred years, been the closest neighbour of English, enjoys such vibrancy, bearing in mind that English has obliterated languages thousands of miles from the coasts of England. This book offers a broad historical survey of Welsh-language culture from sixth-century heroic poetry to television and pop culture in the early twenty-first century. The public status of the language is considered and the role of Welsh is compared with the roles of other of the non-state languages of Europe. This new edition of The Welsh Language offers a full assessment of the implications of the linguistic statistics produced by the 2011 Census. The volume contains maps and plans showing the demographic and geographic spread of Welsh over the ages, charts examining the links between words in Welsh and those in other Indo-European languages, and illustrations of key publications and figures in the history of the language. It concludes with brief guides to the pronunciation, the dialects and the grammar of Welsh.\n\nCONTENTS\nList of Illustrations vii\nList of Maps viii\nAcknowledgements ix\nThe Welsh Language: A Personal Perspective xi\n1 The Origins of Welsh 1\n2 Welsh in the Early British Kingdoms 15\n3 Welsh in the Middle Ages 23\n4 From the Act of Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the Industrial Revolution 33\n5 The Welsh Language in the Era of Industrialization 55\n6 Welsh in the Later Nineteenth Century 69\n7 Welsh in the First Half of the Twentieth Century 87\n8 The Second World War and After 101\n9 The Welsh Language Today 159\n10 Welsh and the Other Non-State Languages of Europe 171\n11 The Characteristics of Welsh 179\nPostscript 189\nFurther Reading 191\nIndex 193","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1051116a7e6597cddfb2f1d65d38ed05771dee2c","amp;dn":"The+Welsh+Language+-+A+History+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1051116a7e6597cddfb2f1d65d38ed05771dee2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,81,17,106,126,101,151,205,223,178,241,214,93,56,237,5,119,29,238,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
