It opens:\n\n\nI used to have a cat, an old fighting tom, who would jump through the open window by my bed in the middle of the night and land on my chest. I'd half-awaken. He'd stick his skull under my nose and purr, stinking of urine and blood. Some nights he kneaded my bare chest with his front paws, powerfully, arching his back, as if sharpening his claws, or pummeling a mother for milk. And some mornings I'd wake in daylight to find my body covered with paw prints in blood; I looked as though I'd been painted with roses.\n\nIt was hot, so hot the mirror felt warm. I washed before the mirror in a daze, my twisted summer sleep still hung about me like sea kelp. What blood was this, and what roses? It could have been the rose of union, the blood of murder, or the rose of beauty bare and the blood of some unspeakable sacrifice or birth. The sign on my body could have been an emblem or a stain, the keys to the kingdom or the mark of Cain. I never knew. I never knew as I washed, and the blood streaked, faded, and finally disappeared, whether I'd purified myself or ruined the blood sign of the passover. We wake, if we ever wake at all, to mystery, rumors of death, beauty, violence.... &quot;Seem like we're just set down here,&quot; a woman said to me recently, &quot;and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t nobody know why.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e52a4f1dc4249872eeb7c79aeeac1d05e253aea6","amp;dn":"Annie+Dillard+-+Pilgrim+at+Tinker+Creek+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e52a4f1dc4249872eeb7c79aeeac1d05e253aea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,42,79,29,196,36,152,114,238,183,199,154,238,172,29,5,226,83,174,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
