He is best known for hits such as &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down&quot;, and &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;. Kristofferson is the sole writer of most of his songs, but he has collaborated with various other figures of the Nashville scene such as Shel Silverstein and Fred Rumfelt.\nKristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to parents Mary Ann (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps (later U.S. Air Force) major general. As is common with many military families, military service was a multi-generational tradition: Kristofferson's paternal grandfather was also an officer (in the Swedish Army). When Kristofferson was a child, his father pushed him toward a military career. Like most &quot;military brats&quot;, Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College in 1954. He experienced his first dose of fame when he appeared in Sports Illustrated's &quot;Faces In The Crowd&quot; for his achievements in collegiate rugby union, football, and track and field. He and fellow classmates revived the Claremont Colleges Rugby Club in 1958, which has remained a Southern California rugby dynasty. Kristofferson became a member of Phi Beta Kappa at Pomona College, graduating in 1958 with a BA, summa cum laude in Literature. In a 2004 interview with Pomona College Magazine Kristofferson mentioned philosophy professor Frederick Sontag as an important influence in his life. \nKristofferson earned a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where his college was Merton. While at Oxford he was awarded his blue for boxing and began writing songs. With the help of his manager, Larry Parnes, he recorded for Top Rank Records under the name Kris Carson. This early phase of his music career was unsuccessful. \nIn 1960, Kristofferson graduated with a BPhil in English literature and married an old girlfriend, Fran Beer. Kristofferson ultimately joined the U.S. Army and achieved the rank of captain. He became a helicopter pilot after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama. He also completed Ranger School. During the early 1960s, he was deployed to West Germany as a member of the 8th Infantry Division. It was during this time that he resumed his music career and formed a band. In 1965, when his tour of duty ended, Kristofferson was offered a position as a professor of English Literature at West Point. Instead, he decided to leave the Army and pursue songwriting professionally. Kristofferson sent some of his compositions to a friend's relative, Marijohn Wilkin, a successful Nashville, Tennessee songwriter.\nIn 1982, Kristofferson participated (with Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Brenda Lee) on The Winning Hand, a country success that failed to break into mainstream audiences. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck, Flashpoint, and Songwriter. The latter also starred Willie Nelson. Kristofferson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. Music from Songwriter (an album of duets between Nelson and Kristofferson) was a massive country success.\nNelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash to form the supergroup The Highwaymen. Their first album, Highwayman was a huge success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. In 1985, Kristofferson starred in Trouble in Mind and released Repossessed, a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly &quot;They Killed Him&quot; (also performed by Bob Dylan), a tribute to his heroes, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus, and Mahatma Gandhi. Kristofferson also appeared in Amerika at about the same time; the mini-series was controversial, hypothesizing life under Communist domination.\nIn spite of the success of Highwayman 2 in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early 1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. Lone Star (1996 film by John Sayles) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in Blade, Blade II, Blade: Trinity, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, Fire Down Below, Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, Chelsea Walls, Payback, The Jacket and Fast Food Nation.\nThe Songwriters Hall of Fame inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as did the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1977. 1999 saw the release of The Austin Sessions. An album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of befriended artists such as Mark Knopfler, Steve Earle and Jackson Browne. In 2003 Broken Freedom Song was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco.\nIn 2004 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; This Old Road. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won CMT's Johnny Cash Visionary Award. Rosanne Cash, Cash's daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in Nashville. Previous recipients include Cash, Hank Williams Jr., Loretta Lynn, Reba McEntire and the Dixie Chicks. &quot;John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes,&quot; Kristofferson said during a phone interview. &quot;I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I'd be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times.\nIn July 2007, Kristofferson was featured on CMT's &quot;Studio 330 Sessions&quot; where he played many of his hits.\nOn June 13, 2008 Kristofferson performed an acoustic in the round set with Patty Griffin and Randy Owen (Alabama) for a special taping of a PBS songwriters series to be aired in December. Each performer played 5 songs. Kristofferson's included &quot;The Best of All Possible World's,&quot; &quot;Darby's Castle,&quot; &quot;Casey's Last Ride,&quot; &quot;Me and Bobby McGee,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes that Rainbow Again.&quot; Taping was done in Nashville.\nKristofferson released a new album of original songs entitled Closer to the Bone on September 29, 2009. It is produced by Don Was on the New West label. Previous to the release, Kristofferson remarked: &quot;I like the intimacy of the new album. It has a general mood of reflecting on where we all are at this time of life.&quot; \nIn 2009, Kristofferson was given special recognition for his songwriting at the BMI Country Awards. He later remarked that &quot;The great thing about being a songwriter is you can hear your baby interpreted by so many people that have creative talents vocally that I don't have.&quot; \nIn December 2009, it was announced that Kristofferson would be portraying Joe in the upcoming album Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King.\nThe Victoria Times Colonist newspaper featured an article on Kristofferson on February 3, 2010. He was honoured with an IN Award from the Victoria Film Festival for independence, innovation, and inspiration, at Victoria BC, Canada. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a2d1806ac6c545e1492ad1fb2def3fa04ede9fa","amp;dn":"Kris+Kristofferson+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a2d1806ac6c545e1492ad1fb2def3fa04ede9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,45,24,6,172,108,84,94,20,146,173,31,178,222,243,250,4,237,233,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
