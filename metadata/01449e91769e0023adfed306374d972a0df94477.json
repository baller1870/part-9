Having both female and male lead vocals has always been a particularly distinctive and effective plan of attack for the band, and while Shapeshifting is no exception, it is Catherine McCandless' burnished, warm, and controlled voice that garners most of the album's focus. Sexy, transformative, and utterly impressive, Shapeshifting is a not simply a landmark album for Young Galaxy, but an unexpected joy to listen to again and again.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Dream Pop\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
