VANGUARD   is   the   long    awaited  ?\n         ?  replacement for your old 19&quot; hardware gear which  you  ?\n         ?  will never use again after you have tried VANGUARD.    ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  VANGUARD is a complete new product. reFX has put  all  ?\n         ?  its knowledge and experience collected over the years  ?\n         ?  into this project, and the result is audible: virtual  ?\n         ?  analog synthesis has just made a big step forward.     ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  VANGUARD  combines  the good  old  analog synthesizer  ?\n         ?  idea with the  latest technology. All  analog devices  ?\n         ?  of classic synthesizers are emulated by  high-quality  ?\n         ?  DSP (digital signal processing) functions. reFX spent  ?\n         ?  a lot  of time  programming the  synthesis functions,  ?\n         ?  and  the   result  is   a  warm   and  rich  sounding  ?\n         ?  synthesizer plugin  with all  the benefits  of todays  ?\n         ?  digital technology.                                    ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  VANGUARD is more than  just a simple synthesizer.  It  ?\n         ?  is equipped  with 31  different type  of oscillators,  ?\n         ?  including  uncommon  digital  oscillators  with fresh  ?\n         ?  modulation options. There is also a huge selection of  ?\n         ?  filters. 13 filter  types are onboard  with different  ?\n         ?  slopes  and including  a new  kind of  combined dual   ?\n         ?  -filter variations.                                    ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  In need of inspiration? No problem for VANGUARD - the  ?\n         ?  trancegate  and  arpeggiator can  help  you out!  The  ?\n         ?  trancegate is a 16-step gate to create rhythmic gated  ?\n         ?  patterns and  the arpgeggiator  comes with  inspiring  ?\n         ?  patterns and several play modes. In addition to these  ?\n         ?  creative tools VANGUARD is equipped with a delay  and  ?\n         ?  reverb.                                                ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?
