The group then joins forces on four JOHNNYSWIM originals, including &quot;Diamonds,&quot; the title track from their full-length debut, produced by Abner and slated for release April 29 on their own indie label Big Picnic Records, as well as &quot;Home,&quot; a Creedence Clearwater-styled swamp-rocker that perfectly captures the Live from Daryl's House setting. There are also performances of the title track from their critically acclaimed Heart Beats EP, and a soulful rendition of &quot;Annie.&quot;\n\nAmanda was exposed to music at a young age, while Abner studied music at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts in his native Jacksonville, FL. The two met in 2006 in Nashville and started collaborating musically after discovering their similar influences of folk, soul and rock. Since then, they've relocated to Los Angeles, released two critically lauded EPs and performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and the Today Show. The duo has toured extensively, including stops at SXSW, Spoleto Festival, Bonnaroo and a support slot for Emeli SandÃƒÂ©. They were chosen as VH1's first-ever &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; artists and have performed on the network's The O Music Awards and Do Something Awards shows. Vogue called their music &quot;infectious,&quot; Entertainment Weekly raved, &quot;As lovely as they are talented,&quot; and Paste said of the duo, &quot;one of a kind.&quot;\n\nJOHNNYSWIM are scheduled to play at SXSW in Austin (March 12-14), the New Orleans Jazz Fest (May 2) and the Firefly Music Festival in Dover, DE (June 19).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b3f1391883f825f4349fea77e55ca5856eeda8","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%27s.House.E65.JOHNNYSWIM.WEB-DL.%5BPSoul%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b3f1391883f825f4349fea77e55ca5856eeda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,179,241,57,24,131,248,37,244,52,159,234,119,229,92,165,133,110,237,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
