Independent studies of Campbell led him to a deep analysis of the ideas of psychologist Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. Highly influenced by psicnÃƒÂ¡lise jungeriana, Campbell wrote, in 1949, the book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (&quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;). The interview is divided into six themes:\n\n1 The Message of the Myth - Campbell compares the creation story of Genesis with creation stories from other cultures in the world.\n\n2. The Saga of Hero - Long before medieval knights take charge of killing dragons, tales of heroic adventures were part of all world cultures. Campbell challenges us to see the presence of a heroic journey in our lives.\n\n3. The first storytellers: Campbell discusses the role of rite of passage in primitive societies, the role of mystical Shamans and the decline of ritual in today's society.\n\n4. Sacrifice and Bliss: Campbell discusses the role of sacrifice in myth, which symbolizes the necessity of rebirth. He emphasizes the need for each one to find his place in this sacred and accelerated technological world.\n\n5. Love and the Goddess - Campbell talks about romantic love, beginning with the 12th century troubadours and the tale of Tristan and Isolde. Also questions the image of the woman in time &quot;pagan&quot; was worshiped as a goddess, but with moteÃƒÂ­smo its function and image have changed.\n\n6. Mask of Eternity - Campbell provides interesting insights about the concepts of God, religion and eternity, as revealed in Christian teachings and the beliefs of Buddhists, Navajo Indians, Schopenhauer, Jung and others. It was his last interview. Week later, Campbell passes away.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb3685ccedf5ec6ca41dd2e23a4db87d3e555d7","amp;dn":"Joseph+Campbell_The+Power+of+Myth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb3685ccedf5ec6ca41dd2e23a4db87d3e555d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,179,104,92,206,223,94,198,202,65,221,46,35,164,219,135,211,229,85,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
