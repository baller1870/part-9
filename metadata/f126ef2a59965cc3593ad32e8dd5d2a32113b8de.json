White Rabbit, Straight Jacket!!!\n\n\n    Bio:\n\n    The White Rabbit is an invitation to step out of ordinary time. You have\n    been chosen and it is not necessary to know or ponder why. It calls us out\n    from our ordinary life to go on an extraordinary journey which will lead us\n    to an experience which will transform us in some very significant way. It is\n    an invitation to enter the realm of the real, hidden, intuitive, unconscious\n    world that exists underneath what appears to be reality. The unlikely\n    pilgrim will be taken to places that he or she never dreamed possible and\n    the passage will cost more than what most are willing to freely give. If you\n    happen upon a White Rabbit, remain awake and alert to the direction you must\n    go and be ready to let go of everything you believed was important. Or...you\n    can continue what you were doing and ignore the invitation. The choice is\n    entirely up to you.\n\n    The return of Egypt Central has made for quite a journey in this young bands\n    career. Having success with their self titled debut cd, the four men from\n    Memphis, TN are poised to continue their impact with the release of their\n    new album White Rabbit and invite the listener to come along.\n\n    Entering the studio with producer Skidd Mills (Saving Abel, 12 Stones, etc.)\n    in early October 2010, they had a clear vision of what they needed to take\n    the next step of this journey and set out to accomplish just that. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We knew\n    we had solid songs, but when the opportunity came to work with Skidd, we\n    found the person that could not only make a great sounding record, but also\n    bring the best out of us.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ states lead singer John Falls. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´We had a lot of\n    growing to do as men and the time was right to give our fans what they\n    deserved and what we knew we were capable ofÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â Kick Ass Rock!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\n    What came out of that recording session is White Rabbit. The body of work is\n    a twelve song compilation of heavy riffs, lyrics from the soul and strong\n    melodic hooks. Threaded throughout this collection of songs is a story of\n    consequences that occur when one accepts or declines the invitation from the\n    White Rabbit.\n\n    ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Collectively this is the best group of songs we have ever writtenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ states\n    bassist Joey Chicago. ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Testing the patience of our fans during the writing\n    process was tough. But as a group we were not going to rush our sophomore\n    record out for the sake of time. We heard their questions as to why it took\n    so long, but once they hear this album, I think they will understand. We\n    wanted to get it right and put everything we had into White Rabbit.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\n    Chicago continues, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´White Rabbit signifies the struggles we have gone\n    through individually and as a group. We all have our demons in our lives and\n    Egypt Central exists to be the voice or ear for fans to lean on. We want to\n    encourage them to never give up and to never quit on their dreams! ItÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s a\n    credo we live by because we have only begun our journey to bring Egypt\n    Central to the masses!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\n    The first single and title track White Rabbit will be released Feb 2011 to\n    Active rock radio and iTunes and the full length CD will be released in May\n    2011.\n\n    They will hit the road in early 2011 and if there is one thing you can be\n    assured of is, once you see an Egypt Central show you canÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t wait for them to\n    return. In the words of drummer Blake Allison ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´Our secret weapon has always\n    been our live show. I canÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â t tell you how excited we are to play this new\n    batch of songs for our fans that have stuck by us and this is our invitation\n    for anyone new to Egypt Central to come along on this journeyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  we hope you\n    accept!ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶\n\n\n\n\n\ngreat band...just saw their name and decided to dl it...not bad\nlike atrreyu or rise against. seed plz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f126ef2a59965cc3593ad32e8dd5d2a32113b8de","amp;dn":"Egypt_Central-White_Rabbit-2011-MTD+GREAT+ROCK%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f126ef2a59965cc3593ad32e8dd5d2a32113b8de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,38,239,42,89,150,92,195,89,58,211,46,141,213,210,163,33,19,184,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
