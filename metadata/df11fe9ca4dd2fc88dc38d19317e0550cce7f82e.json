And the best ones will cross that line more than once during their running time, but in a way that makes the viewer laugh convulsively rather than roll their collective eyeballs and leave the cinema.\n\n'Speaking Of Sex' largely succeeds, in my opinion. But it is really only due to the collection of actors involved. It is most definitely held together almost entirely by some fabulous performances by the ensemble cast. James Spader, Bill Murray, Jay Mohr and Catherine O'Hara really shine in this one. A lesser group of talent would've buried the film. Thankfully, these actors make it work (or, at least, make it eminently watchable). But it does leave you with the feeling that someone should really write these actors something more worthy of their talents. If the script and direction had been sharper and the story more refined, with this innovative and talented cast, the movie could've easily been a comedy classic. It's just a shame that the material itself doesn't hold a candle to the actors who're giving it their all in bringing it to life. \n\nIf someone could write these under-rated actors (particularly Spader and Murray) a really great script, I'm sure the result would be awesome. And more wholly deserving of the 7-out-of-10 rating I'm giving this picture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df11fe9ca4dd2fc88dc38d19317e0550cce7f82e","amp;dn":"Speaking.of.sex.DVDRip.DivX.MHR.iNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df11fe9ca4dd2fc88dc38d19317e0550cce7f82e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,17,254,156,164,221,47,200,141,195,141,25,49,126,5,80,204,231,248,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
