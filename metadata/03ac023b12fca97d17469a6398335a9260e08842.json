It includes bin/cue CD image files of the original installation CD\n(including the audio tracks).\n\nThis release includes LaunchBox (and DOSBox) which will allow you to easily play\nthe game on modern Windows PCs. No configuration or installation is necessary.\nSimply run LaunchBox.exe and then double-click on the game to play.\n\nThis game involves puzzle solving, while creating wacky machines. Each level of\nthe game contains a machine designed to do a specific task. The only problem is,\nthere are parts missing, and it is your job to figure out where to put what in\norder to get the machine to work. The game features many wacky machine parts,\nincluding cats, super balls, lava lamps, flashlights, can openers, monkeys on\ntreadmills, and many more wacky parts to get your machine working. The game also\ncomes with an editor to let you design your own unique machines from scratch.\nThese can either be for fun, or you can set it so that the person playing has to\nfill in the missing parts, just like in the campaign.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ac023b12fca97d17469a6398335a9260e08842","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+Machine+2+%281994%29+%28PC+Game%29+%28HereticXS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ac023b12fca97d17469a6398335a9260e08842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,172,2,59,18,252,169,125,23,70,154,99,152,51,90,146,96,224,136,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
