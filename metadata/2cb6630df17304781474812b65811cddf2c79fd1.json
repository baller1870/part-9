This particular unit consisted of the greatly underrated tenor-saxophonist George Coleman and the young rhythm section of pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. Since Davis's future studio albums with this group (after Wayne Shorter replaced Coleman) would be sticking exclusively to group originals, this exciting set gives one the opportunity to hear this band really stretching out on older tunes, showing off the influence of the avant-garde along with the players' own individual styles. It's highly recommended transitional music.\n\n\nTracks\n1 Introduction by Mort Fega 1:40\nAMG Pick 2 My Funny Valentine Hart, Rodgers 14:55\n3 All of You Porter 14:40\n4 Go-Go Fega 1:43\n5 Stella by Starlight Washington, Young 13:03\n6 All Blues Davis 8:51\n7 I Thought About You Mercer, VanHeusen 11:14\nAMG Pick 8 So What Davis 9:11\nAMG Pick 9 Walkin' Carpenter 8:08\n10 Joshua Feldman 9:31\n11 Go-Go Fega 1:43\n12 Four Davis 6:28\nAMG Pick 13 Seven Steps to Heaven Davis, Feldman 7:46\n14 Listen Now!
