It was distributed by New Line Cinema.\n\nThe film tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard (Norton) and Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Vinyard (Furlong) of Venice, Los Angeles, California. Both are intelligent and charismatic students. Their father, a firefighter, is murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to extinguish a fire in a South Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into the Neo-Nazi movement. Derek brutally kills two black gang members whom he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to four years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and ideology and how Derek, now radically changed by his experience in incarceration, which includes violent rape by white neo-Nazi inmates, tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path as he did. The film is told in the style of nonlinear narrative.\n\nDavid McKenna scripted the film and shooting took place in Los Angeles, California. The film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and went on to gross over $23 million at the international box office. It was given an &quot;R&quot; rating by the MPAA for &quot;graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality and nudity.&quot;\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDerek (Edward Norton), un joven &quot;skin head&quot; californiano de ideologÃƒÂ­a neonazi, fue encarcelado por asesinar a un negro que pretendÃƒÂ­a robarle su furgoneta.
