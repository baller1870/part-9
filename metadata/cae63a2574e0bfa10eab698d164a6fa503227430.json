Eventually Rosie is rescued by the tough, taciturn cowboy Abel Wood (Tab Hunter), and together they reach the miserable town of Chili Verde where the entire population, not many after all, can always be found at a saloon run by Marguerita Ventura (Lainie Kazan) and her nit-wit bouncer/gunslinger, Bernardo (Henry Silva). Abel soon discovers that the reason why the population is so interested in Marguerita's saloon has nothing to do with hard liquor -- Marguerita and Rosie each have one half of a map of buried treasure tattooed on their backsides, and everyone wants a look at the whole map. That situation introduces rather absurd bedroom farce. Viewers with a very broad if not bawdy sense of humor will most enjoy this earthy exercise in parody.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip):\n\nGeneral           : Lust In The Dust.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 195 Kbps\nLength            : 1.28 GiB for 1h 23mn 46s 21ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 999 Kbps\nAspect            : 708 x 364 (2.305) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089523/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089523/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio:English\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese\n\nMy rip.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae63a2574e0bfa10eab698d164a6fa503227430","amp;dn":"Lust+in+the+Dust+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cae63a2574e0bfa10eab698d164a6fa503227430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,230,58,37,116,224,191,161,14,171,105,141,22,74,111,165,3,34,116,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
