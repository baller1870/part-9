Your pathogen has just infected 'Patient Zero' - now you must bring about the end of human history by evolving a deadly, global Plague whilst adapting against everything humanity can do to defend itself. \n\nPlague Inc. is so realistic that the CDC even asked the developer to come and speak about the infection models in the game! http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2013/04/plague-inc/. \n\nOver 35 million players have been infected by Plague Inc., and Plague Inc: Evolved combines the original critically acclaimed gameplay with significant, all-new features for PC: \n\nInfectious Multiplayer - cooperative and competitive gameplay modes let you team up to fight the cure with friends, or compete in a race to kill the world. \nContagious Content Creator - hit the lab and develop your own custom scenarios, creating new plague types and worlds. Bring your deadliest ideas to life and share them with Steam Workshop. \nBlinding Graphics - including full 3D disease models taking you closer to your plague than ever before, city-cams showing humanity's struggle at street level, and the body scanner highlighting the full effect of your mutations, organ by organ. \nDeadly Data - predict government responses with priority indicators, geek out with loads of new stats and graphs, and analyse your best strategies with end-of-game replays.\n\nPlease note that Plague Inc: Evolved is currently in Early Access (see above for more details). We are currently hard at work and will be adding / polishing features over the coming weeks.
