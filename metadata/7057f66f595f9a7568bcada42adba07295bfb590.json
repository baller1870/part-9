The character was featured in several series from the 1940s until the 1980s and developed a mythos and supporting cast of his own, including foster parents Ma and Pa Kent, love interest Lana Lang and the time traveling allies the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nThe character was adapted into a Superboy television series (1988-1992) and a teenage Clark Kent, secretly using his powers in heroic acts, appears in the highly successful Smallville TV series (2001ÃƒÂ¢??present), drawing to a great extent on the comic book continuity in its depiction of young Clark\\\\\\&amp;#039;s life.\n\nThis is my first DC post. This torrent contains Superboy v1, v2 and also New Adventurs of Superboy. It covers Kal El(Superman) only the orignal Superboy. DC has created a lot of clones of Superman and named them as Superboy, but they are not covered here. \n\nI wont be seeding this for 24 hrs but have patience.\n\nEnjoy and Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7057f66f595f9a7568bcada42adba07295bfb590","amp;dn":"Superboy%28Kal+El%29+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7057f66f595f9a7568bcada42adba07295bfb590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,87,246,111,89,95,154,117,104,188,173,164,42,219,160,114,149,191,181,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
