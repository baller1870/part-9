It was directed by Jan de Bont. The film was based upon a script by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin. The film's executive producers were Steven Spielberg, Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Gerald R. Molen. Twister was the second-highest grossing film of 1996, with an estimated 55 million tickets sold.\n\nIn the movie, a team of storm chasers try to perfect a data-gathering instrument, designed to be released into the funnel of a tornado, while competing with another better-funded team with a similar device during a tornado outbreak across Oklahoma. The plot is a dramatized view of research projects like VORTEX of the NOAA and the device, called Dorothy, is copied from TOTO used in the 1980's by NSSL.\n\nTwister is notable for being both the first Hollywood feature film to be released on the DVD format and the last to be released on HD DVD. Twister has since been released in high definition on Blu-ray disc. It was nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound in 1997.\n\ncredit Legend.Killer.RG BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2e9e59927e3db6446c90110774f39bbb4fb9cde","amp;dn":"Twister.1996.DVDRip.XviD-LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2e9e59927e3db6446c90110774f39bbb4fb9cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,233,229,153,39,227,219,100,70,201,1,16,119,79,57,187,180,251,156,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
