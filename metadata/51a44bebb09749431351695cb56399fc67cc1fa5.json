It was in the H.264 mp4 format which plays fine if you have your video setup correctly. But it's a pain in the ass if you don't. So I took it and converted it over to a nice avi file in XviD format (the average for TV RIPS/DVDRIP episodes) for those that don't want the H.264.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51a44bebb09749431351695cb56399fc67cc1fa5","amp;dn":"Star.Trek.New.Voyages.S01E05.Blood.and.Fire.Part.2.WEBRIP.XviD-S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51a44bebb09749431351695cb56399fc67cc1fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,164,75,235,176,151,73,67,19,81,105,92,181,99,153,252,103,204,31,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
