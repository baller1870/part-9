Al-Megren (Intech, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nNatural gas is a vital component of the world's supply of energy and an important source of many bulk chemicals and speciality chemicals. It is one of the cleanest, safest, and most useful of all energy sources, and helps to meet the world's rising demand for cleaner energy into the future. However, exploring, producing and bringing gas to the user or converting gas into desired chemicals is a systematical engineering project, and every step requires thorough understanding of gas and the surrounding environment. Any advances in the process link could make a step change in gas industry. There have been increasing efforts in gas industry in recent years. With state-of-the-art contributions by leading experts in the field, this book addressed the technology advances in natural gas industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d923e75e9b37c32a95f3582fe9ee04545d2ce0","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Natural+Gas+Technology+-+Hamid+A.+Al-Megren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d923e75e9b37c32a95f3582fe9ee04545d2ce0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,217,35,231,94,155,55,195,42,149,243,88,47,233,238,4,84,93,44,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
