It gives a rundown of what everything is and where it came from in the back of the book, in French. Published by Les Humanoides Associes.\n\n'Enki Bilal - Le Sommeil Du Monstre' (Translates to The Sleeping Monster)\nLes Humanoides Associes, 1998\nThis is a 70 page graphic novel that looks quite beautiful, but again, it's in French.\n\nEnki Bilal and Pierre Christin - Los Angeles: L'etoile oubliee de Laurie Bloom\nPublished by Autrement Albums, 1984\nThis looks like it would be damn cool if the images/pages were reformated and the text was in English. But neither of those is the case. The scanning and image formatting is odd and the text is all in French. It appears to be observations of people, places and events in LA in the early 80s. Which, if you don't already know, was a very crazy time. That appears to be represented here, at least visually.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:144bf4f71d569e2c11d112af719b4a21f660bf5a","amp;dn":"Enki+Bilal+French+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"144bf4f71d569e2c11d112af719b4a21f660bf5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,75,244,247,29,86,158,44,17,209,18,175,113,155,74,33,246,96,191,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
