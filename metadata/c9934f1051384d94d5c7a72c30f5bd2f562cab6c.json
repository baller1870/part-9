The jazz bug \n\n\ngrabbed me after hearing these in the 1980's\n\n\nIn uncompressed .WAV because the album is short\n\n\nAll songs are good but 1,6,7,9 and 11 are outstanding\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9934f1051384d94d5c7a72c30f5bd2f562cab6c","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+trio%3B1959%2C+A+Jazz+Portrait+of+Frank+Sinatra+%28no+v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9934f1051384d94d5c7a72c30f5bd2f562cab6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,147,79,16,81,56,77,148,213,199,167,44,48,245,189,47,86,44,171,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
