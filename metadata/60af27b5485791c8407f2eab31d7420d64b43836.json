And so the adventure begins.\n\nSome say this is one of the darkest movies of the series, and it includes torture and lots of action considering it's a cartoon and especially pertaining to the Dexter series. However, some funny moments catch your eye from time to time too.\n\nAh, finally changed the image, I'm glad to see people still seed this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60af27b5485791c8407f2eab31d7420d64b43836","amp;dn":"Dexters+laboratory+-+Ego+trip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60af27b5485791c8407f2eab31d7420d64b43836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,175,39,181,72,87,145,200,64,127,46,171,49,215,66,13,100,180,56,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
