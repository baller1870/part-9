His teaching encompassed topics in quantum mechanics, special relativity, field theory, elementary particle physics, mathematical physics, and functional analysis. His research fields include mathematical physics (Pad'{e} approximants), elementary particle physics (symmetries and quark models), and statistical physics (ergodic problems), and he has published articles in a wide range of national and international journals as well as the previous Springer book (with Alessandro Chiesa), Problemi di Meccanica Quantistica non Relativistica.\n\nDr. Ittay Weiss completed his BSc and MSc studies in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and he obtained his PhD in mathematics from Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands. He spent an additional three years in Utrecht as an assistant professor of mathematics, teaching mathematics courses across the entire undergraduate spectrum both at Utrecht University and at the affiliated University College Utrecht. He is currently a mathematics lecturer at the University of the South Pacific. His research interests lie in the fields of algebraic topology and operad theory, as well as the mathematical foundations of analysis and generalizations of metric spaces. \n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (14 November 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319037129\nISBN-13: 978-3319037127","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a5e6f718b8c70c69e2cd8746adbe4aa81a8503","amp;dn":"%5BCarlo+Alabiso%2CIttay+Weiss%5DA+Primer+on+Hilbert+Space+Theory+Line","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a5e6f718b8c70c69e2cd8746adbe4aa81a8503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,165,230,247,24,184,199,12,105,226,205,135,70,173,190,74,168,26,133,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
