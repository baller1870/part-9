It started with eight bodies found murdered, raped and mutilated. A brilliant Soviet forensics expert (Stephen Rae) is put in charge of the case by his colonel (Donald Sutherland). But the investigation is buried under Communist red tape and denial (serial killing only happens in the decadent west). With fifty-two victims to his name, the killer they call Citizen X finally takes shape before their eyes. But can they trap him before he kills again?\n\n  Starring: Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Joss Ackland, Zsolt Biro, Andras Balint.\n\n  Directed by: Chris Gerolmo.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  1hr. 47min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 640 x  480\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b07eb80b39972020ac3a4d9af621dd4cb9108c","amp;dn":"Citizen+X+%281995%29+%28Stephen+Rea%2C+Donald+Sutherland%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b07eb80b39972020ac3a4d9af621dd4cb9108c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,176,126,184,11,57,151,32,32,172,58,77,154,246,33,221,76,185,16,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
