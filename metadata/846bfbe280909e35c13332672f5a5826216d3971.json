In addition to attacks on network availability and authentication, administrators must contend with eavesdropping, audio injection, Caller ID spoofing, VoIP phishing, and other unique exploits. All of these security holes can result in the leakage of information and in unreliable phone calls. Hacking VoIP reviews the many possible VoIP attacks, and discusses the best defenses against them for both enterprise and home VoIP solutions. Author Himanshu Dwivedi introduces popular security assessment tools, describes the inherent vulnerabilities of common hardware and software packages, and provides the first ever VoIP security audit program. The book covers common enterprise VoIP protocols such as SIP and RTP as well as unique protocols like H.323 and IAX.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:846bfbe280909e35c13332672f5a5826216d3971","amp;dn":"Hacking+VoIP.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"846bfbe280909e35c13332672f5a5826216d3971","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,107,251,226,128,144,158,53,193,51,50,103,47,90,88,38,33,109,57,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
