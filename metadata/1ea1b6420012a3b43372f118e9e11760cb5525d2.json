We take the tools and commands that you're familiar with and teach you how to use several of those functions together to create time-saving SketchUp workflows. We recommend that you watch our Level 1 training DVD first to establish a solid base of 3D modeling fundamentals, then watch this DVD to learn more advanced workflows.\nInside the DVD\nThis DVD contains 6 different lessons with nearly 3 hours of total instruction. We begin by creating more complex buildings and teaching you how to work effectively with groups and components. Then we demonstrate how to draw complex objects using the Follow-me tool. Finally, we cover advanced topics such as Photomatch and creating Animations.\n-: MPEG2\n-: 720*480, NTSC 4/3, MPEG-2, 29,97fps, 3767kbps\n-: AC-3, stereo, 48kHz, 192kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea1b6420012a3b43372f118e9e11760cb5525d2","amp;dn":"Google+SketchUp+Level+2+%28DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea1b6420012a3b43372f118e9e11760cb5525d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,161,182,66,0,18,163,180,51,114,241,24,233,225,23,96,203,85,37,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
