Still, relatively few clinicians specialize in trauma and training is often obtained through experience. The number of trauma patients is expected to continue to grow as pre-hospital care continues to advance. As well, hospitals increasingly see trauma treatment, which requires no pre-approval, as a good source of revenue. Given these developments, the number of opportunities for specialists trained in trauma, including anesthesiologists and critical care physicians, will expand in the years ahead. This book addresses the need for an up-to-date, comprehensive and clinically focused volume for practitioners and trainees in trauma anesthesia and critical care. It is organized by organ system. The editor is an attending physician at a major urban hospital center recognized worldwide for its outstanding emergency medical services including trauma care and is recruiting leading trauma anesthesiologists to contribute. Anesthesiologists, pain medicine physicians, critical care physicians and trainees are the target audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca059aaea4cb5906cfa88be114282f45b23912f2","amp;dn":"Anesthesia+for+Trauma+%28Springer%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca059aaea4cb5906cfa88be114282f45b23912f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,5,154,174,164,203,89,6,207,168,139,225,20,40,47,69,178,57,18,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
