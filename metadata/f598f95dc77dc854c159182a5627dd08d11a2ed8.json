In a flashback, her husband, a drunken brute named Aubrey (Franklin Dyall), is drinking from that decanter. His drunkenness prevents her portrait from being painted. Meanwhile, the painter, Claude (Eric Bransby Williams), is smitten with Larita and attempts to seduce her when her husband leaves. She rejects Claude's advances, but Aubrey walks in on them and Claude and Claude dies. Aubrey files for divorce on the grounds of adultery, which is why Larita is court this day. The juries decides in Aubrey's favor, considering the proof that Claude left Larita his entire fortune.\n\nSince she is now a disgraced woman of &quot;easy virtue&quot;, Larita leaves for the French Riviera to avoid attention. During a tennis match, she meets a rich younger man, John Whittaker (Robin Irvine), and soon marries him. Even though they are madly in love, she does not tell him about her past, and they return to England to meet his family. While friends and family seem to like Lartia, his mother strongly disapproves of her, having recognized Larita's face from the papers. She questions John about where Larita comes from, but he does not have any answers.\n\nJohn's mother remains suspicious about Larita, and makes her life miserable. Larita begs John to go back to the south of France, but he does not understand why she is so unhappy in England. She feels his family hates her and they are teaching him to hate her, too. Later that day, John admits to his family that he made a mistake marrying Larita.\n\nThen, John's mother sees Larita's face in the papers, and Larita's past comes to light. The family confronts Laurita, with his mother telling her that, &quot;In our world, we do not understand this code of easy virtue.&quot; During a party the family hosts, the family tries to keep Larita upstairs, but she comes down anyway. She realizes how unwanted she is and decides to allow John to divorce her so he can marry Sarah (Enid Stamp Taylor), a local girl whom his mother had in mind as a suitable match.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 80 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 80 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f598f95dc77dc854c159182a5627dd08d11a2ed8","amp;dn":"Alfred+Hitchcock+Classics+-+Easy+Virtue+%281928%29+Silent+-+Xvid+1cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f598f95dc77dc854c159182a5627dd08d11a2ed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,152,249,93,199,125,200,84,193,89,24,42,86,39,221,8,209,26,46,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
