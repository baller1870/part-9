Far from anyone he knew or trusted, a young Lemony Snicket started an apprenticeship for a secret organization shrouded in mystery and secrecy. He asked questions that shouldn't have been on his mind. Now he has written an account that should not be published that shouldn't be read. Not even by you. Seriously, we recommend that you do NOT ask your parents for this, the first book in his new ALL THE WRONG QUESTIONS series.\n\nLemony Snicket, in case you don't already know, grew up to be the author of A Series of Unfortunate Events series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c5a1c4bdb74714e87b1b213dbba6efb8ae440aa","amp;dn":"Who+Could+That+Be+At+This+Hour+%28All+The+Wrong+Questions+%231%29+-+Le","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c5a1c4bdb74714e87b1b213dbba6efb8ae440aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,90,28,75,219,116,113,78,135,177,178,19,219,186,110,251,138,228,64,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
