Bubonic plague is still around today, and kills in the dozens, rather than in the hundreds of thousands. \nTwenty-first-century pandemic experts from Porton Down reveal the real killer, as well as why London in 1348 proved the perfect soil for the disease to kill in such large numbers, and what this 650-year-old cataclysm can teach us. \nEvery disease has its time and place; what is coming for us next?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/4470/k509.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/4470/k509.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5387/ogkc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/5387/ogkc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7893/a9iv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7893/a9iv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6366/is5m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6366/is5m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/405/ed9s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/405/ed9s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9476/p0f1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9476/p0f1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/566/biyh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/566/biyh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9509/bh4h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9509/bh4h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2017/tzrs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2017/tzrs.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/858/z4ib.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/858/z4ib.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/9323/fsqe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img571.imageshack.us/img571/9323/fsqe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5383/fj85.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/5383/fj85.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;662e0f010e262a524857&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2581 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 47mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 914 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26770334&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26770334&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Black%20Death&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Black%20Death&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54377394f8768069d066a48c58c3e3d1c10def74","amp;dn":"Ch4+Secret+History+Return+of+the+Black+Death+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54377394f8768069d066a48c58c3e3d1c10def74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,55,115,148,248,118,128,105,208,102,164,140,88,195,227,209,193,13,239,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
