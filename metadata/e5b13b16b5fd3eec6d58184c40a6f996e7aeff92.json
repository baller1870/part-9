The music is enchanting; it swings with precision and ease and draws the listener into its orbit with an uncommon grace.\n \nRecorded with a superb quintet, Ron CarterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass creates that bottom that allows Alice Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, and Joe Henderson to fly or hover. Each note is chosen carefully but deftly too. And when he solos, you just feel a sense of satisfaction. Meanwhile, Drummer Ben Riley has the golden touch. Not only does he play the beat, he plays the beat between the beat.\n\nFrom the purifying catharsis of the first moments of the title track to the last moments of &quot;Mantra,&quot; with its disjointed piano dance and passionate ribbons of tenor cast out into the universe, the album resonates with beauty, clarity, and emotion.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ptah, The El DaoudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ deserves to be embraced for the gem it is; a truly great album.\n\n\nAlice Coltrane\n\nPtah, The El Daoud\n\n1970\n\n\n   CD / 1996 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 Ptah, The El Daoud\n\n2 Turiya And Ramakrishna\n\n3 Blue Nile\n\n4 Mantra\t\n\n\nRecorded at the Coltrane home studio in Dix Hills, New York on 26 January 1970\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nAlice Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€ harp, piano\n\nJoe Henderson Ã¢â‚¬â€ alto flute, tenor saxophone [left channel]\n\nPharoah Sanders Ã¢â‚¬â€ alto flute, tenor saxophone [right channel]\n\nRon Carter Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass\n\nBen Riley Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums\n\n\nAlice Coltrane / Ptah, the El Daoud / 1970","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b13b16b5fd3eec6d58184c40a6f996e7aeff92","amp;dn":"Alice+Coltrane+-+Ptah%2C+The+El+Daoud+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b13b16b5fd3eec6d58184c40a6f996e7aeff92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,177,59,22,181,253,62,236,109,88,24,76,64,166,249,150,231,174,255,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
