The original tracks forming the basis for these remixes were composed by Desert Dweller Amani Friend for a series of Yoga DVDs co-produced by Rara Avis of Yogi Tunes &amp; Craig Kohland of ShamanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dream.\n\nOne of Desert DwellersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most popular tracks is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wandering SadhuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ a song remixed in a diversity of ways for this two-part, digital-only collection. Volume 1 features versions by electronica luminaries Drumspyder and Jef Stott. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rounded out by ambient dub legend Banco de GaiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shiva NatarajÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as well as contributions from Kaleidoscope Jukebox and Chaos Control.\n\nFor over a decade, Desert Dwellers have been creating exceptional original material, steadily and deservedly ascending the ladder to musical renown.
