Running a little bait-and-tackle shop is the earthy -- almost feral -- young lass Hee-jin (Seoh Jung), who sometimes sells herself for a price to horny fishermen. On one raft is the morose youth Hyun-shik (Kim Yu-seok), who Hee-jin has quietly taken a shine to after saving him from a suicide attempt. His ham-fisted advances are rejected, but after a second try at suicide, in which he puts fishing hooks in his mouth, she nurses him back to health. Soon, a freakily-intense relationship builds between the two in which the jealous Hee-jin starts to brutally dispatch with any competition.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Seom AKA The Isle.2000.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 011 Kbps\nLength            : 5.05 GiB for 1h 30mn 15s 119ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : ko\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #2           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255589/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255589/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Korean\nSubtitles: English, Portuguese, Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48aead112389658514a45a7d030b69ded7bd3ce","amp;dn":"Seom+AKA+The+Isle.2000.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48aead112389658514a45a7d030b69ded7bd3ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,138,234,209,18,56,150,88,81,74,69,167,208,48,182,157,237,123,211,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
