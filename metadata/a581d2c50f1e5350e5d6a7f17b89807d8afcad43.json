The original game, ported to run on modern PCs. \n\n\nThe basic idea behind Death Rally: win races, gather more money, buy upgrades to your vehicle. In between wreck your opponents, shoot your way through bystanders and keep the pedal to the metal!\n\n\nGame requirements:\nAny PC that can run Windows XP SP3, Vista or Windows 7 (32-bit or 64-bit). Please read the readme in the installation package for more information. \n\n\nThx to Remedy for porting the game to Windows, i had nothing to do with it. Just uploaded the game to piratebay..\n\n\n\nEnjoy - redbulltp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a581d2c50f1e5350e5d6a7f17b89807d8afcad43","amp;dn":"Death+Rally+%28Original+full+version+ported+to+Windows%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a581d2c50f1e5350e5d6a7f17b89807d8afcad43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,129,210,197,15,30,83,80,229,214,167,241,123,137,128,125,138,252,173,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
