Led by frontman Patterson Hood and comprising a rotating cast of Georgia and Alabama natives, the band celebrated the South while refusing to paint over its spotty past. History, folklore, politics, and character studies all shared equal space in the Truckers catalog, which offered up its first blast of gutsy, twangy rock with 1998's Gangstabilly. However, it was the band's ambitious double-disc concept album, The Southern Rock Opera, that became their unlikely magnum opus. A two-act affair, the album explored Patterson Hood's fascination with 1970s Southern rock (specifically Lynyrd Skynyrd) while tackling the cultural contradictions of the region, and it helped lay the groundwork for much of the band's subsequent work. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry/Rock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.I Do Believe\n02.Go-Go Boots\n03.Dancin' Ricky\n04.Cartoon Gold\n05.Ray's Automatic Weapon\n06.Everybody Needs Love\n07.Assholes\n08.The Weakest Man\n09.Used To Be A Cop\n10.The Fireplace Poker\n11.Where's Eddie\n12.The Thanksgiving Filter\n13.Pulaski\n14.Mercy Buckets\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3f33c206e68c891ac2da9d527c57e9fb74e31da","amp;dn":"Drive-By+Truckers+-+Go-Go+Boots+%282011%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3f33c206e68c891ac2da9d527c57e9fb74e31da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,243,60,32,110,104,200,145,172,45,169,213,39,197,126,159,183,78,49,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
