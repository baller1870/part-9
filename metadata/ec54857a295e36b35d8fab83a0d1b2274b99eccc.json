When belts have to be tightened, we want to read about an OS with all the features of a commercial Linux variety, but without the pain. The Definitive Guide to CentOS is the first definitive reference for CentOS and focuses on CentOS alone, the workhorse Linux distro, that does the heavy lifting in small and medium-size enterprises without drawing too much attention to itself.\n\n    * Provides tutorial and hands-on learning but is also designed to be used as a reference\n    * Bases all examples on real-world tasks that readers are likely to perform\n    * Serves up hard-won examples and hints and tips from the author's experiences of CentOS in production\n\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\n\n    * See why CentOS is an ideal platform for deploying services on the same level as Redhat Enterprise Linux without the cost.\n    * Prepare and install a CentOS server from scratch.\n    * Install and configure core services.\n    * Follow best practices for managing and administering the server and its services.\n    * Integrate enterprise features in CentOS/Red Hat networks.\n    * And finally, move away from Fedora, which has great features, but is not meant to be a server OS!\n\n\nWho is this book for?\n\nBoth beginning and experienced system administrators who want to have an industrialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“strength Linux server distribution at their fingertips\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHailing from the UK, Peter Membrey has worked for Red Hat, holds a RHCE certification, and worked and taught at a number of educational institutions since the beginning of his career. He knows what Linux users like and need, and hopes that CentOS will get the kudos it deserves. He lives in Hong Kong and is teaching and consulting on all matters to do with Linux Enterprise networking, while studying for his masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec54857a295e36b35d8fab83a0d1b2274b99eccc","amp;dn":"The+Definitive+Guide+to+CentOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec54857a295e36b35d8fab83a0d1b2274b99eccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,84,133,122,41,94,54,179,93,143,171,131,160,209,178,39,75,153,236,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
