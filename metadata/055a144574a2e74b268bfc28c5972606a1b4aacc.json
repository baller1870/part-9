This album brings together tracks from three different sessions, the bulk being held in 1997. Supported by a spartan rhythm section, Bell sprays kamikaze guitar licks over a bevy of old standards like &quot;Five Long Years,&quot; &quot;Who Do You Love,&quot; &quot;Mean Old Frisco,&quot; and &quot;You're the One.&quot; The last four songs on the album are the real treat; cut in 1995 at the Mercurial Son sessions, this is just Lurrie and his electric guitar running through raw, soulful, and sometimes whacked-out versions of everything from &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot; to &quot;If I Had a Hammer.&quot; If you've wondered what all the fuss is about, grab this CD and turn on to the blues world of Lurrie Bell. ~ Cub Koda\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
