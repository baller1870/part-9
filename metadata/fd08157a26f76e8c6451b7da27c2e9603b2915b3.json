Learn how to craft materials like wood, bronze, and glass, and then light your scene inside the Unity 3D game engine. Author Adam Crespi starts out with simple materials and gradually introduces more complex shaders: diffuse surfaces like plaster, as well as metal and reflections. Then you'll delve into the magic of bringing a level to life with lighting, including point, spot, and directional lights. Finally, explore light baking with the Beast lightmapping engine.\nTopics include:\n\n    Creating and editing a diffuse material\n    Bringing out shine with specular materials\n    Building reflective materials\n    Creating a custom shader\n    Lighting you scene\n    Fine-tuning hard and soft shadows\n    Color tinting a baked light\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd08157a26f76e8c6451b7da27c2e9603b2915b3","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Materials+and+Lighting+in+Unity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd08157a26f76e8c6451b7da27c2e9603b2915b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,8,21,122,38,247,110,140,100,81,183,218,39,194,233,96,59,41,21,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
