There are many variations of shamanism throughout the world, but several common beliefs are shared by all forms of shamanism. Shamans function as intermediaries between the human and spirit worlds. They can treat illness and are capable of entering supernatural realms to provide answers for humans.\n\nIf there is any interest, I have another reference book as well as audio (lessons and drumming) that I'll upload. You can show interest, of course, by downloading and seeding... please!\n\nCheck my torrents for more reference books on spirituality and other topics.\n\nFor an introduction to shamanism, check the Wikipedia article (quoted above) - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso, I found an introductory audio at archive.org that you can stream or download - &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/ShamanismTheOldestInwardPath&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/ShamanismTheOldestInwardPath&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0bd933a1e1cd997a488d6d69089797ae7c8dd7","amp;dn":"Historical+Dictionary+of+Shamanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0bd933a1e1cd997a488d6d69089797ae7c8dd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,11,217,51,161,225,205,153,122,72,141,109,105,8,151,151,174,124,141,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
