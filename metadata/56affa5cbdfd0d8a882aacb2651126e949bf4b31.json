He was born in Highland Park Hospital. Felix is a producer and DJ mostly known for house music and electroclash.\nFelix is regarded as a member of the second wave of Chicago house. He entered the dance music elite not only via his recordings (under a number of aliases, including Thee Maddkatt Courtship, Aphrohead and Sharkimaxx), but also for his ownership of Radikal Fear Records, one of the premiere Chicago labels of the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\nKittenz and Thee Glitz \n\n\nKittenz and Thee Glitz is a 2001 album by American DJ / producer Felix da Housecat. It was released in the U.S. on Emperor Norton in 2002 after being critically acclaimed in the UK. It features the single &quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; and the vocals of French artist Miss Kittin.\n\nThe album mixes early Eighties electronic music, of the kind released by Ze records artist Cristina, with house music. It invented the electroclash genre, and acts such as Fischerspooner and Goldfrapp have been influenced by it. Outside of that genre, the use of electronic Eighties backings on R&amp;B hits such as Amerie's &quot;1 Thing&quot;, shows the wider continuing effect of this album.[citation needed]\n\nIt was listed by noted music journalist Paul Morley in his book Words and Music, as one of his 100 albums to hear if you think Radiohead's Kid A is weird.\n\nThe album's first single, &quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; should be noted to contain a sample of the Ben Liebrand remix of The Flirts single &quot;Passion&quot;, whilst &quot;Harlot&quot; contains an unaccredited sample of the drum pattern from The Human League track, &quot;The Sound of the Crowd&quot;.[citation needed]\n\n&quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; was also featured in the Soundtrack to Midnight Club II for the X-Box, PC, and Playstation 2.\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Harlot (Intro)&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10 \n2.\t&quot;Walk With Me&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 \n3.\t&quot;Voicemail&quot; (Felix da Housecat, Miss Kittin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47 \n4.\t&quot;Madame Hollywood&quot; (HervÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51 \n5.\t&quot;Silver Screen Shower Scene&quot; (Jenefsky, Lorello, Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 \n6.\t&quot;Control Freaq&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11 \n7.\t&quot;What Does It Feel Like?&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36 \n8.\t&quot;Happy Hour&quot; (Jenefsky, Lorello, Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 \n9.\t&quot;Thee Enter View&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:14 \n10.\t&quot;Glitz Rock&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 \n11.\t&quot;Analog City&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:18 \n12.\t&quot;Pray for a Star&quot; (Crump, Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 \n13.\t&quot;Sequel2Sub&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50 \n14.\t&quot;Magic Fly&quot; (Marouani) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00 \n15.\t&quot;She Lives&quot; (Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03 \n16.\t&quot;Runaway Dreamer&quot; (Crump, Stallings) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56affa5cbdfd0d8a882aacb2651126e949bf4b31","amp;dn":"Felix+Da+Housecat+-+Kittenz+and+thee+Glitz+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56affa5cbdfd0d8a882aacb2651126e949bf4b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,175,250,92,189,253,13,138,136,42,172,178,101,17,38,233,73,191,75,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
