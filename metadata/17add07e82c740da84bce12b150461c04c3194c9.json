As Mac or iPhone users we are privileged: software that\nrequires little time, effort, or documentation to become productive is the rule rather than the exception.\nUnfortunately, that rule hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t historically extended to the tools and technologies used to create such programs.\nLearning to write software for the Mac has traditionally involved a major investment of intellectual effort and time\nin new tools, technologies, and techniques. I have thought for a long time that this is an essentially artificial barrier.\nDelivery in the sophisticated environment of the Mac and iPhone takes a lot of effort behind the scenes, and there\nis no doubt that learning to write software that works in such environments involves taking on a significant burden\nof new technologies and concepts. However, I believe that, with suitably accessible tools, and some good, clear,\nwritten guidance, creating great Mac and iPhone software should be within the grasp of most competent\ndevelopers.\nWith the latest release of the Xcode Developer Tools, the new developer has access to a formidable tool-chest for\nMac and iPhone development that is easier to use than any previous version. The missing piece, to me, has always\nbeen a simple and clear description of the tools and technologies needed to write for the Mac and iPhone. That is\nwhy I have written this book.\nI wrote this book with the idea that it would be a companion for the new developer. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the book that I hope you\nwill keep within reach as you learn to write software for the Mac and iPhone, because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the book that I wish IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d\nhad. It is intended to be a friendly guide to the environment, tools, techniques, and technologies that you will need\nto take on to be comfortable writing software for the Mac and iPhone. It will take you, I hope in a fairly rational way,\nfrom the basic developer tools through to more advanced technologies such as source-code management,\nperformance analysis, and unit testing. Along the way you will be visiting some lesser-travelled roads to learn about\nusability and accessibility. Although there is a progression from simple to advanced topics, this is also a book to dip\ninto where you need to, and to skip the areas you already know or donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to know right now. It is, finally,\nintended to be funÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½using a Mac is one of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great pleasures, after all, so why shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it be fun to write software\non it and for it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17add07e82c740da84bce12b150461c04c3194c9","amp;dn":"Learn.Xcode.Tools.for.Mac.OS.X.and.iPhone.Development","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17add07e82c740da84bce12b150461c04c3194c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,173,208,126,130,199,64,218,132,188,225,43,21,4,97,192,76,49,148,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
