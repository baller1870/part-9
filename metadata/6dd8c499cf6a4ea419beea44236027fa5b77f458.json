Days To Remember\n\n\n\n\nAcclaimed Australian singer-songwriter Lior release his fourth studio album Scattered Reflections, a collection of songs written during and inspired by recent travels.\n\nScattered Reflections is released independently and was financed largely through crowd sourcing from many of LiorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fans through a PledgeMusic online campaign, a testament to his loyal and strong following. The title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœScattered ReflectionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ explores the juxtaposed feelings inherent in travel; the immense feeling of mortality and insignificance intertwined with an overwhelming sense of a connected and shared humanity. Recorded in collaboration with new producer Lachlan Carrick in Sydney and in LiorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hometown of Melbourne, the album features long-standing musical collaborator Brett Hirst on bass alongside new band members Evan Mannell and Bree Van Reyk, both on percussion. Guitarist and songwriter Cameron Deyell (Totara Jack) co-wrote a number of songs on the album.\n\nOf this album Lior says &quot;The making of this album had a sense of freedom and joy to it. Conceptually I feel that it's filled with reflections that only a richer life experience could provide, while musically, Lachlan and the new band members have brought a new and stylish sound to the arrangements. I'm really proud of this album and hope it connects, particularly with the people that were so generous in lending their support to crowd source this record.&quot;\n\nScattered Reflections also features a handful of beautiful acoustic gems which have become synonymous with Lior. The hauntingly beautiful track 'My Grandfather' may be Lior's most intimate moment yet as a singer-songwriter and will surely receive a very strong emotive response as he tours Australia this year.\n\nRenowned for his stunning voice, incredible musicality and acclaimed live shows, Lior has received several ARIA nominations since his debut in 2005. His stunning independent debut and self-financed album, Autumn Flow, was one of the most successful independent debut releases by an Australian artist. Three Aria nominations followed, including a nomination for Best Male Artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd8c499cf6a4ea419beea44236027fa5b77f458","amp;dn":"Lior+-+Scattered+Reflections+%5B2014%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd8c499cf6a4ea419beea44236027fa5b77f458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,216,196,153,207,106,78,164,25,190,234,68,35,96,39,250,91,119,244,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
