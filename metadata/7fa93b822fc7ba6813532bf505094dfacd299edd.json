No pressure. Young Avengers is as NOW! as the air in your lungs, and twice as vital. It's the book that knows Hyperbole is the BEST! THING! EVER! \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa93b822fc7ba6813532bf505094dfacd299edd","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+10+%28darkhomr%29+%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa93b822fc7ba6813532bf505094dfacd299edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,169,59,130,47,199,186,104,19,83,43,245,5,9,77,250,205,41,158,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
