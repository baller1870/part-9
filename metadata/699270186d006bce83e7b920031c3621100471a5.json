Barsky (Translator)\nSeries: Literature and Philosophy\nLibrary Binding: 320 pages\nPublisher: Penn State University Press (December 4, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0271020318\nISBN-13: 978-0271020310\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nThe subject of the passions has always haunted Western philosophy and, more often than not, aroused harsh judgments. For the passions represent a force of excess and lawlessness in humanity that produces troubling, confusing paradoxes.\nMichel Meyer provides new insight into an age-old dilemma: Does passion torture people because it blinds them, or, on the contrary, does it permit them to apprehend who and what we really are?\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nThe subject of emotions in philosophy is very much on the front burner in many areas today, including such diverse disciplines as cognitive science, ethics, and the philosophy of rhetoric. Meyer's book is thus right on the money. It is sensible in its quasi-historical structure, imaginative in its insights, especially at the intersection of emotions, rationality, rhetoric, and logic, which is one of the author's primary concerns. I recommend it to English-speaking philosophers who are interested in the subject of emotions and in what is currently going on on the other side of the English Channel. --Robert C. Solomon, University of Texas, Author of The Passions\n\nMichel Meyer offers a wide-ranging exegesis the first of its kind that systematically retraces the history of philosophical conceptions of the passions in the work of such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Spinoza, Descartes, Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, and Freud. The great ruptures that led to passion s condemnation as sin, and to its romantic exultation as the truth of existence, are meticulously registered and the logic governing them astutely explained. --Translation Review\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nMichel Meyer is Professor of Philosophy at the Free University of Brussels and the University of Mons.
