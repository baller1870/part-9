Confronted with the death of a beloved sister, her children's departure for college, and her own recent battle with breast cancer, she was searching for a way forward. One cold, gray evening, flooded with thoughts of change and loss, she wandered into the U.S. Botanic Garden's conservatoryÃ¢â‚¬â€and a dream was born. Dazzled by the vast and dense tangle of greenery, she began a quest to create a verdant sanctuary of her own at her home in suburban Washington, D.C.\n\nYet all she knew of indoor gardening was a lone, neglected houseplant at the top of her basement stairs. Paradise Under Glass chronicles her journey from brown thumb to greenÃ¢â‚¬â€a project that takes her across the country. Along the way she meets commercial growers with acres under glass in Florida, a clivia hybridizer whose Delaware home is filled with thousands of specimens, a beneficial bug grower in California, entrepreneurs in Ohio who have a veritable Noah's Ark of rare tropicals, and many others who share their enthusiasms and knowledge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d81f6941603ebe84d1c573e1f8015e66e8d281","amp;dn":"Paradise+Under+Glass%3A+An+Amateur+Creates+a+Conservatory+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d81f6941603ebe84d1c573e1f8015e66e8d281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,216,31,105,65,96,62,190,132,209,197,115,225,248,1,94,102,232,210,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
