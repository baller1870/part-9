As Walter Kaufmann, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading authorities on Nietzsche, notes in his introduction, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Few writers in any age were so full of ideas,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted.\n\nThe Portable Nietzsche includes KaufmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts of NietzscheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four major works: Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Nietzsche Contra Wagner and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. In addition, Kaufmann brings together selections from his other books, notes, and letters, to give a full picture of NietzscheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, versatility, and inexhaustibility.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c27e3807e0fe888da4b130338290955eacdeaec","amp;dn":"The+Portable+Nietzsche+%28pdf%29+%5Bnew+scan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c27e3807e0fe888da4b130338290955eacdeaec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,39,227,128,126,15,232,136,218,75,19,3,56,41,9,85,234,205,234,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
