Reavis \n\nA combination how-to manual for 32 types of fresh or cured sausage and cookbook with 175 recipes.\nMaking sausage at home is simple and pain free. Once you've learned the basics, experimentation and sausage innovation are bound to take over. Then before you know it, you will be making gourmet sausages that are better than anything you can buy in the market, and at half the cost! Charles Reavis's Home Sausage Making introduces a world of banger possibilities--from traditional pork to salmon and poultry. However, you will need more than just the book. A meat grinder is recommended as is a sausage stuffer and sausage skins. Beyond that, ingredients are pretty basic. This is, after all, reaching right back to the peasant kitchen--and the mindset that there's a way to use everything from snout to tail except for the squeal. Start with Reavis, then reach beyond.\n\nPlz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65de5422db9b71bab2bf3e6339f257a71060988a","amp;dn":"Home+Sausage+Making+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65de5422db9b71bab2bf3e6339f257a71060988a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,222,84,34,219,155,113,186,178,191,62,99,57,242,87,167,16,96,152,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
