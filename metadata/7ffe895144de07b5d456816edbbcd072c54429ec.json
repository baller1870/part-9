Does not include megacamps.\n\nFrom the Matrix Games page:\nWhat is SPWaW?\nSteel Panthers: World at War is a tactical level, World War II era, historical wargame. This is a very highly refined version of Steel Panthers III, placed in the Steel Panthers I game scale. We used Steel Panthers III since it was the most stable version of the game engine yet created. The original game series was designed by Gary Grigsby, Keith Brors and Joel Billings. SP:WaW is a hex based, top down view, alternating turn (&quot;I go, you go&quot; or IGOUGO) game design. SP:WaW also includes a timed play feature, giving each player a specific amount of time to conduct his turn before it ends and his opponent&amp;#039;s turn begins. Armor, gun and vehicle units are represented by individual icons. Each infantry squad can have up to 25 men in it. Machine guns, mortars and artillery units are also realisticaly portrayed and crewed. Each hex represents 50 yards (meters) of the virtual battlefield, with many new terrain features added. Each game turn represents a few minutes of real time, and games can last from a few turns to entire campaigns.\n\nMinimum system requirements:\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Windows 98/Me/2000/XP\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ DirectX 9.0b\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ Pentium II 400 MHz CPU\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ 64MB Ram\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ 16 Bit Direct Sound Comp.
