The definitive book on PowerShell V2.\nWindows PowerShell transformed the way administrators and developers interact with Windows. PowerShell, an elegant dynamic language from Microsoft, lets you script administrative tasks and control Windows from the command line.

It includes full chapters on these topics and also covers new language elements and operators, events, Web Services for Management, and the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment.\n\nThe First EditionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coverage of batch scripting and string processing, COM, WMI, and .NET have all been significantly revised and expanded. The book includes many popular usage scenarios and is rich in interesting examples that will spark your imagination. This is the definitive book on PowerShell v2!\n\nWho Should Read It\nWritten for developers and administrators with intermediate level scripting knowledge. No prior experience with PowerShell is required.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a200d31be51cf9d1e6787896e3fd20c065b5e426","amp;dn":"Bruce+Payette+-+Windows+Powershell+in+Action","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a200d31be51cf9d1e6787896e3fd20c065b5e426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,0,211,27,229,28,249,209,230,120,120,150,227,253,32,192,101,181,228,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
