You dictate how the story unfolds, from the battles you choose to fight down to the allies or enemies you make along the way. Slash, sneak, detonate and shoot your way across the island in a world that has lost all sense of right and wrong. Beware the beauty and mystery of this unexplored paradise and live to outwit its roster of ruthless, desperate characters. You'll need more than luck to survive.\n\nBeyond the limits of civilization lies an island, a lawless place ruled by piracy and human misery, where your only escapes are drugs or the muzzle of a gun. This is where you find yourself, trapped in a place that's forgotten right from wrong, a place that lives by the principles of violence.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFar Cry 3 Minimum System Requirements:\n\nOperating system: Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7\nCPU: 2.0 GHz dual core processor\nRAM: 1GB of system memory\nGraphics: DirectX 9 compatible card with 256 MB RAM.
