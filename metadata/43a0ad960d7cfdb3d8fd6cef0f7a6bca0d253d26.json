Also included are a handful of instrumentals and original compositions. Most of the album is sung in the affected country crooning voice that Dylan had introduced a year earlier on Nashville Skyline.\n\nDylan has claimed in interviews that Self Portrait was something of a joke, far below the standards he set in the 1960s, and was made to get people off his back and end the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. &quot;All the Tired Horses&quot; (Dylan)\n2. &quot;Alberta #1&quot; (Traditional, arranged by Dylan)\n3. &quot;I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know&quot; (Cecil A.
