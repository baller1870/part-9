Patterns codify good design principles and facilitate maintainable code that can be worked on by teams. Design patterns are also a way for teams to communicate about the structure and architecture of an application. Patterns are a language that can be used to convey ideas and facilitate discussions.\r\nIn this course, Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will cover some of the most common and most useful design patterns used in JavaScript. Each pattern will be demonstrated with a standalone example bundled in a JavaScript module","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2e5c4c90ae7601019cfeee8337508e4c2c6b93","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Put+JavaScript+Design+Patterns+Into+Practice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2e5c4c90ae7601019cfeee8337508e4c2c6b93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,46,92,76,144,174,118,1,1,156,254,238,131,55,80,142,76,44,107,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
