Six adept musicians decided to unify. Their diverse musical influences and ideas in one formation called Aeveron.\n\nSoon it became apparent that the created pieces could hardly be assigned to one specific musical style.\n\nBut since the so called Ã¢â‚¬Å“stereotypical thinkingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has become indispensable even in the music scene, Aeveron consider that the term Ã¢â‚¬Å“Melodic Sweden DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seems to be adequate as an orientation.\n\nThey released three full length albums up to date. &quot;Construality&quot; came to light on October 30th, 2004. It contained 9 songs, and it was released under &quot;Northern Silence Productions&quot; label. In 2008 (October 24th specifically) they released &quot;Existential Dead End&quot; with, again 9 songs, this time under a different label, &quot;Battlegod Productions&quot;. And what's their last job to date, &quot;Impending Doom&quot;, that was released on September 1st, 2011, this time with no label, and containing 10 songs, starting with an instrumental introduction.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nJens LÃƒÂ¶tzsch\tGuitars\nDirk Neidhardt\tBass\nPaul\tDrums\nMarkus FÃƒÂ¶rster\tKeyboards\nThomas Berthel\tVocals\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nConstruality (2004)\nExistential Dead End (2008)\nImpending Doom (2011)\n\n\n\nImpending Doom (2011)\n\n\n\n01 Impending Doom\n02 Lethal Wrath\n03 Dead and Gone\n04 Illusions\n05 The Niche\n06 The Final Tempest\n07 Voyage of the Spirit\n08 Premature Interment\n09 The Black Dagger\n10 The Anthropophobic\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tMelodic Death / Black Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t112.06 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files\nAdded:\t25/10/2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52656f3c82cc53e807d1e6e37eb19e4df312fd84","amp;dn":"+Aeveron+-+Impending+Doom+mp3+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52656f3c82cc53e807d1e6e37eb19e4df312fd84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,101,111,60,130,204,83,232,7,209,230,227,126,177,158,77,243,18,253,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
