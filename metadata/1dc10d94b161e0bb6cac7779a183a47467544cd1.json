One can also divide the four horn players by placing tenorman Coltrane and trumpeter Sulieman on one side and tenorman Jaspar with trumpeter Young on the other.\n\n The album features the first recording of pianist Mal Waldron's composition, &quot;Soul Eyes&quot;, which went on to become a jazz standard. The trumpets and tenor saxes collectively create a warm, intimate, and inviting harmonic embrace. Kenny Burrell is sublime as is Mal Waldron, while the muted sound of Webster Young conjures the cool and sweetness of Miles Davis. But the secret weapon of this blowing session is pianist Mal Waldron, whose compositions and arrangements are custom-tailored. \n\n This interesting blend of instrumentalists lives up to its potential with Coltrane pushing boundaries, pointing in the direction his music would continue to take - affording the chance to hear just how radical his departure from convention was.\n\n\n\nThe Prestige All-Stars:\n\n John Coltrane / Bobby Jaspar / Idrees Sulieman / Webster Young\n\n Interplay for 2 Trumpets and 2 Tenors\n\n 1957\n\n\n \n    CD / 2006 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\n Tracklist:\n\n 1.
