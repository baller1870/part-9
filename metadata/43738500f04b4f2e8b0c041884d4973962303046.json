I can tell that this was made in the eighties or early 90's so its more like VHS quality, 4:3 aspect ratio, I tried to clean them up quality wise when running them through the converter, overall I give it A:8/V:8, but the content is a 10, very valuable tool for the serious martial artist, yeah the guy looks cheesy, but he knows what he is talking about. Dan Inosanto was his instructor, Bruce lee taught Dan.It took me a few days to D/L the original torrent, because no one seeds, so don't be an asshole,If you dl, seed back. This is my 1st torrent uploaded, I'll seed until I see that its healthy enough to keep circulating, and I'm trying to get this info out to all those who really want it, so my up speed  has no limiter. let me know what you think, if you have any request for other styles of martial art, e books, diagrams, charts, whatever I'll try to get them up and running as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43738500f04b4f2e8b0c041884d4973962303046","amp;dn":"Jkd+Instructional+dvd%5C%27s+1-7+divx+format+++thevenomous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43738500f04b4f2e8b0c041884d4973962303046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,115,133,0,240,75,79,46,139,12,4,24,132,212,151,57,98,48,48,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
