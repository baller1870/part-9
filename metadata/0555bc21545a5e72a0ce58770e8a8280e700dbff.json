I directed this video myself and the production of\nthe video cost around $170,000. (This was largely paid for by the tickets\nbought by the audiences at both shows). The material in the video was\ndeveloped over months on the road and has never been seen on my show\n(LOUIE) or on any other special. The risks were thus: every new generation\nof material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop. The\ntime and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it with a big\ncompany. If I'd done it with a big company, I would have a guarantee of a\nsizable fee, as opposed to this way, where I'm actually investing my own\nmoney.\n\nCAST\nLouis C.K. ...
