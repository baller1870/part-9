Although they offer radical new ways of understanding cinema, his conclusions often seem strikingly Eurocentric. Deleuze and World Cinemas explores what happens when Deleuze's ideas are brought into contact with the films he did not discuss, those from Europe and the USA (from Georges MÃƒÂ©liÃƒÂ¨s to Michael Mann) and a range of world cinemas - including Bollywood blockbusters, Hong Kong action movies, Argentine melodramas and South Korean science fiction movies. These emergent encounters demonstrate the need for the constant adaptation and reinterpretation of Deleuze's findings if they are to have continued relevance, especially for cinema's contemporary engagement with the aftermath of the Cold War and the global dominance of neoliberal globalization.\n\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Academic; 1 edition (April 21, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0826436420\nISBN-13: 978-0826436429\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;Through close readings of films from a wide range of periods, genres, regions and styles, Martin-Jones provides convincing arguments for the relevance of Deleuze's film theory and for the necessity of recasting, revising and extending many of Deleuze's key concepts to deal with the diverse cinemas of the world. Martin-Jones writes with clarity and verve, bringing lucidity to Deleuze's difficult texts and offering provocative insights into a variety of cinematic traditions and practices. A superb contribution to Deleuze studies and essential reading for anyone interested in world cinemas&quot; - Ronald Bogue, University of Georgia, USA\n\nDeleuze and World Cinemas is distinctive in the critical literature on cinema: it offers a reading of Deleuze that is neither for nor against the philosopher. It is respectful of Deleuze's writings on cinema, but the book is steadfast in its tracing of the various ways in which Deleuze's formulations of the time-and movement-images, their Eurocentrism, necessitate their reconsideration in the context of World cinemas. Jones argues convincingly and in a lucid and engaging style for an &quot;a-Deleuzian&quot; position based on a careful examination of the Deleuze texts themselves, on major studies of Deleuze's cinematic philosophy, and on seminal writings in cinema theory and practices. Most striking is Martin-Jones's selection of films that, instead of rehearsing usual canonical suspects, opts for an analysis of popular films from Argentina, South Korea, Hong Kong, Hollywood, and India to refine on, expand, and resituate Deleuze's thoughts on cinema in the context of globality.&quot; - Marcia Landy, University of Pittsburg, USA\n\n&quot;Martin-Jones's application of Deleuze on cinema to a global context goes well beyond mere idolatry. He offers at once, a critical reading of Deleuze's ideas, a comprehensive account of the development of contemporary global cinema, and a wealth of critical film readings. The book is a must for those interested in Deleuze on the way cinema thinks as well as those interested in the way global culture is articulated in a wide variety of contemporary films&quot; - Michael J.
