Jamie Phillips had dropped in on Thelma Reitz, only to have that staid old lady blow his head off with a shotgun. Jamie's atomized neck was enough to make even the most hardened cop wince. Ã¢â‚¬â€ Obviously a setup, thinks Detective Joe Gunther, but the crime soon takes on even more shocking dimensions. \n\nFirst, Gunther discovers that murderess and victim were co-jurors on the sensational Harris murder trial three years earlier. Then, several vicious assaults lead Gunther to suspect that whoever planned Jamie's diabolical death won't quit till the Harris affair is reopened, even if it means killing every juror...and the cop on the case.\n\nGenre: Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a727deac5b128b5905810da2da8d30bf68c54417","amp;dn":"Open+Season+by+Archer+Mayor+%28Joe+Gunther+%231%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a727deac5b128b5905810da2da8d30bf68c54417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,39,222,172,91,18,139,89,5,129,13,162,218,141,48,191,104,197,68,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
