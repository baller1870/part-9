Drawing both on archival materialÃ¢â‚¬â€wills, letters, and manuscript compositions, some presented here for the first timeÃ¢â‚¬â€and on printed writings, Ross gives us an unprecedented sense of educated early modern womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives.\nSponsored and often educated by their learned fathers and other male relatives within a model that Ross terms Ã¢â‚¬Å“the intellectual family,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ female authors publicized their works within the safety of family networks. These women, including Christine de Pizan, Laura Cereta, Margaret More Roper, Lucrezia Marinella, and Bathsua Makin, did not argue for womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political equality, but they represented and often advocated womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intellectual equality. Ross demonstrates that because of their education, these women had a renaissance during the Renaissance, and that in so doing they laid the foundation for the emancipation of womankind.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nA provocative and academic new reading of Renaissance feminism for a post-feminist generation. (Kate Lowe, Queen Mary, University of London)\n\nThe Birth of Feminism comes to us as a crucial book at this time since--strange to say--we still lack synthetic, comprehensive studies in women's literary and political history prior to 1750. Ross's book spans 300 years and documents the rise of a discourse of women's rights and the culture of feminism in two nations, offering a much needed guide to the period and its chief actors. (Diana Robin, University of New Mexico)\n\nThis is an impressive and very persuasive study. I would recommend it to anyone interested in women's literature, women's history, or in the history of education for the wealth of information Ross has gathered and for the effective way she builds her argument about the education of women within the intellectual family. (Elissa B. Weaver, University of Chicago)\n\nSarah Ross redraws our maps of Renaissance society and culture in this erudite and fascinating book. She recreates a lost world of women humanists, who found new meanings in ancient texts and new literary possibilities in ancient models. She rediscovers, behind them, another forgotten world, one of generous fathersÃ¢â‚¬â€real and fictiveÃ¢â‚¬â€who helped women learn, write, and make their way into the public world. And through deft close readings of a wide range of texts, she proves that both in Italy and in England, intellectual women had an extraordinary Renaissance.
