The film is in French.\n\nHave a look at the sample.\n\nPlot Outline: \n\nA gang of young thieves flee Paris during the violent aftermath of a political election, only to hole up at an Inn run by neo-Nazis.\n\nReview:\n\n&quot;I saw this movie at Sitges International Film Festival on October, 2007, and I am still trying to survive to the shock. I&amp;#039;ve seen lots of gore movies as I am a big fan of these kind of genre in cinemas, but I hardly remember something so cruel, so brutal, so anti-human, so dirty and so extreme. It&amp;#039;s one of those movies that you must not see with your girlfriend, otherwise you&amp;#039;re exposed to have a deep argument about your film tastes. So you are on your own, if you have the chance to take a glimpse to this movie, don&amp;#039;t hesitate. It&amp;#039;s, by far, one of the most thrilling experiences in the land of gore movies for about the last 10 years.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e23f65dabb08ec1a27ab0c5e8937a306de663b","amp;dn":"Frontiers.2007.UNRATED.LiMiTED.DVDRiP.XViD-HLS.%5BHarcoded.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e23f65dabb08ec1a27ab0c5e8937a306de663b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,226,63,101,218,187,8,236,26,39,171,12,94,137,55,163,6,222,102,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
