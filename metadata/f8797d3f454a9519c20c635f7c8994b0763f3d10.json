Brown (Author), Christopher S. Foote (Author), Brent L. Iverson (Author), Eric Anslyn (Author)\n\nHardcover: 1296 pages\nPublisher: Brooks Cole; 6 edition (February 4, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 084005498X\nISBN-13: 978-0840054982\n\nRenowned for its unified mechanistic themes, emphasis on biological examples, use of applied problems from the pharmaceutical field, and unrivaled full-color visuals, ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, Sixth Edition, delivers cutting-edge coverage packed with reader-friendly features. Offering a clear presentation, the book offsets reaction mechanisms in a stepwise fashion and emphasizes similarities between related mechanisms, using just four different characteristics: breaking a bond, making a new bond, adding a proton and taking a proton away. Numerous resources assist in mastery of key concepts and problem-solving skills, including a running margin glossary, a mini in-text study guide, medicinal chemistry problems, unique roadmap problems, and more in-chapter examples than any other book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8797d3f454a9519c20c635f7c8994b0763f3d10","amp;dn":"Organic+Chemistry+%286e%29+%5BBrown%2C+Foote%2C+Iverson%2C+Anslyn%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8797d3f454a9519c20c635f7c8994b0763f3d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,121,125,63,69,74,149,25,194,12,99,95,124,137,148,176,118,63,61,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
