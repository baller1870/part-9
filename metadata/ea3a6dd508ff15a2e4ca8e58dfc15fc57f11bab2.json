It presents both new concepts and new families of codes. For example, lengthened and modified lengthened cyclic codes are introduced as a bridge towards time-invariant convolutional codes and their extension to time-varying versions. The novel families of codes include turbo codes and low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, the features of which are justified from the structural properties of the component codes. Design procedures for regular LDPC codes are proposed, supported by the presented theory. Quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, in block or convolutional form, represent one of the most original contributions of the book. The use of more than 100 examples allows the reader gradually to gain an understanding of the theory, and the provision of a list of more than 150 definitions, indexed at the end of the book, permits rapid location of sought information.\nAbout the Author\nGiovanni Cancellieri is full professor of Telecommunications at Polytechnic University of Marche, Italy. His main research activities relate to optical communications, multimedia services, networks, mobile communications, and channel coding. He is a member of various worldwide and European technical associations and standardization bodies.\n\nPublisher: Springer; 2015 edition (20 November 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319017268\nISBN-13: 978-3319017266","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3a6dd508ff15a2e4ca8e58dfc15fc57f11bab2","amp;dn":"Polynomial+Theory+of+Error+Correcting+Codes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3a6dd508ff15a2e4ca8e58dfc15fc57f11bab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,58,109,213,8,255,21,162,228,202,142,88,223,193,95,197,127,17,186,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
