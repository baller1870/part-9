Originally fronted by vocalist Ian Dury as Ian Dury and the Blockheads, \nthe band has continued to perform since Dury's death in 2000. Current members include Derek Hussey (vocals), Chaz Jankel (guitar),\n Norman Watt-Roy (bass guitar), Mick Gallagher (keyboard/piano), John Turnbull (vocals/guitar). John Roberts (drums) There\n is rolling line up of saxophone players that includes Gilad Atzmon, Terry Edwards or Dave Lewis and from time to time, the \noriginal sax player, Davey Payne. The band are best known for their hit singles, recorded with Dury, &quot;What a Waste&quot;, \n&quot;Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick&quot;, &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3&quot; and &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.\nUnder the management of Andrew King and Peter Jenner (the original managers of Pink Floyd) Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly\n gained a reputation as one of the top live New Wave music acts. Their first single &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot; marked Dury's\n Stiff debut and although it was banned by the BBC it was named Single of the Week by NME on its release.It was soon followed by\n the album New Boots and Panties!!, which was eventually to achieve platinum status. (Although it has been claimed that Dury \ncoined the phrase &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, there is evidence that it was already in common use and a very similar phrase had\n been used by Australian band Daddy Cool for the title of their 1972 second album Sex, Dope &amp; Rock'n'Roll: Teenage Heaven.The\n tune is based on part of Charlie Haden's bass solo on &quot;Ramblin'&quot; on Ornette Coleman's 1959 album Change of the Century.\nDury and the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and scored several hit singles, including \n&quot;What a Waste&quot;, &quot;Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick&quot; (which was a UK number one at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a\n million copies) and &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3&quot; (number three in the UK in 1979).\n\n=====================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll.flac\n02 What A Waste.flac\n03 Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3).flac\n04 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick.flac\n05 Billericay Dickie.flac\n06 If I Was With A Woman.flac\n07 Blackmail Man.flac\n08 Wake Up And Make Love With Me.flac\n09 My Old Man.flac\n10 Sweet Gene Vincent.flac\n11 Blockheads.flac\n12 Clevor Trever.flac\n13 I'm Partial To Your Abracadabra.flac\n14 There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards.flac\n15 Inbetweenies.flac\n16 Superman's Big Sister.flac\n17 I Want To Be Straight.flac\n18 Spasticus Autisticus (Live).flac\n19 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (12'' Version).flac\n20 Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3) (12'' Version).flac\n\n=======================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 523 MB\nAlbum                                    : Sex&amp;Drugs&amp;Rock&amp;Roll - The Essential Collection\nTrack name/Total                         : 20\nComposer                                 : Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2010\nComment                                  : EAC V1.0 beta 2, Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip, FLAC -8\nAlbum/Composer                           : Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads / Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads\n\n======================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 838 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f8de2c59c9fbdc645220f99b2cf21bb360e6be","amp;dn":"Ian+Dury+%26amp%3B+The+Blockheads+-+Sex%26amp%3BDrugs%26amp%3BRock%26amp%3BRoll+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f8de2c59c9fbdc645220f99b2cf21bb360e6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,248,222,44,89,201,251,220,100,82,32,249,155,44,242,27,179,96,230,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
