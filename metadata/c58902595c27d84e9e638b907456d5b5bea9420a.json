Buying milk, returning an overdue library book, getting Gary Coleman's autograph, what could possibly go wrong? \nBlast, chop and piss your way through a freakshow of American caricatures in this darkly humorous first-person adventure. Meet Krotchy: the toy mascot gone bad, visit your Uncle Dave at his besieged religious cult compound and battle sewer-dwelling Taliban when you least expect them! Endure the sphincter-clenching challenge of cannibal rednecks, corrupt cops and berserker elephants. Accompanied by Champ, the Dude's semi-loyal pitbull, battle your way through open environments populated with amazingly unpredictable AI. Utilize an arsenal of weapons ranging from a humble shovel to a uniquely hilarious rocket launcher. \nCollect a pack of attack dogs! Use cats as silencers! Piss and pour gasoline on anything and everyone! YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58902595c27d84e9e638b907456d5b5bea9420a","amp;dn":"Postal+2+Complete+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58902595c27d84e9e638b907456d5b5bea9420a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,137,2,89,92,39,216,78,158,99,139,144,116,86,213,181,190,169,66,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
