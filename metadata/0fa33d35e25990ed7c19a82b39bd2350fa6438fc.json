But one tragic night shatters their friendship and their lives forever.\n\nElla used to be a rule-breaker with fiery attitude who wore her heart on her sleeve. But she left everything behind when she went to college and transformed into someone that follows the rules, keeps everything together, and hides all her problems. But now it's summer break and she has nowhere else to go but home.\n\nElla fears everything she worked so hard to bury might resurface, especially with Micha living right next door. If Micha tries to tempt the old her back, she knows that it will be hard to resist.\n\nMicha is sexy, smart, confident, and can get under EllaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skin like no one else can. He knows everything about her, including her darkest secrets. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to bring his best friend, and the girl he loves back, no matter what it takes.
