Made with the mixer in mind, the sample disc contains many unique features not found in any other drum sample discs. First and foremost is the sound. Steven has sold drum samples to some of   the country's top mixers. His samples are big, fat, and punchy sounding. The samples have been thoroughly tweaked and tested in actual mixes within       various musical styles. Where many drum sample discs are very raw and        unprocessed, Steven Slate drum samples have been eq'd and compressed with    precision so that you can put them in a mix and simply throw the fader up.   Little to no tweaking is necessary, the work has been done, the sound is already there.                                                               Another unique feature is Z system. Every single drum sample set is        processed in one of four ambient spaces. For instance, Z1 mono sets are      sampled so that there is slight amount of overhead micing creating a three   dimensional, airy, punchy, natural drum tone. Z2 sets are stereo samples, and have heavily compressed far room mics mixed in with closer mics, and the     result is a larger then life, deep and fat sound that has great dimension    even in thick rock mixes. Z3 mono sets are very dry and are not processed    with any ambient mics, creating a sound that is ultra punchy and &quot;in your    face&quot;. These sets are great with most punk and speed metal mixing.  The new  Z4 sample sets are the isolated room sound of each sample.  Mixing a Z1 with its Z4 sample will create an unbelievabley 3D drum tone that will have anyone believe your drums were recorded in a beautiful sounding drum room.          On many sample CDs, a particular drum is sampled with one sound. However,  any drummer knows that different sounds can be had from a drum by tuning the drum at certain tensions, by dampening and undampening the drum, by using    different drum heads, or by tightening and loosing    the snares. Steven     Slate Drums makes use of all these wonderful sounds, and many of the drums   are sampled with different tunings, different heads, and different           dampenings. For instance, a pop rock song will probably require a low tuned, long decaying, non ringing snare drum sound. A hard rock tune might require a high tuned, quick decaying, open sounding snare drum with a touch of natural shell ring.                                                                   As any pro audio engineer knows, running audio through various different   gear can create subtle to obvious sonic differences. Some of the samples on  Steven Slate Drums were processed through different eq's and compressors,    yielding a similar sound with a slightly different quality which may suit    certain mixes better. For instance, by using a different compression chain,  Steven could change the sound of the initial transient from ultra tight and  punchy, to ultra splatty with more decay sound and body.                      \n                                                                                                                                          \n TCSRES - fixtheworld\n                        \n\n\n\n                                          ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29675ec2a0951c60f29182ffb748366b7ef08775","amp;dn":"Y.M.E.Steven+Slate+Drums+v1.6+GOG+-+TCSRES.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29675ec2a0951c60f29182ffb748366b7ef08775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,103,94,194,160,149,28,96,242,145,130,255,183,72,54,107,126,240,135,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
