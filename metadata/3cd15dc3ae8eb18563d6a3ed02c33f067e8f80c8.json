The game is described by one of the devs, Jake Kazdal, as an &quot;arcade style turn-based strategy game.&quot; The developers claim that they were influenced by Advance Wars, but wanted a less rigid form of gameplay. What sets this game apart is that it doesn't use a grid, instead going for analogue controls. Additionally, the developers didn't like the &quot;rock, paper, scissor&quot; system seen in the aforementioned Advance Wars and many other strategy games, instead opting for three different and flexible core units with pros and cons that can be used against any other units, depending on how they're used. Additionally, the property based parts of Advance Wars have been streamlined for simplicity and to go with the faster &quot;arcade approach&quot; the devs are going for. This is the first game ever which allows cross platform multiplayer play between Microsoft's Windows 8/RT, Windows Phone, and Xbox LIVE services.\n\nSystem requirements: P4, 1 GB RAM, 1 GB HDD\n\nunpack\nburn or mount\nplay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd15dc3ae8eb18563d6a3ed02c33f067e8f80c8","amp;dn":"Skulls+of+the+Shogun+FANiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd15dc3ae8eb18563d6a3ed02c33f067e8f80c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,209,93,195,174,142,177,133,99,214,163,237,2,195,63,6,126,143,128,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
