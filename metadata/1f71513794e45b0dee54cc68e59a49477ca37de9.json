It begins in the period of Israelite settlement in the First Iron Age period (1200-1000 BC). The extensive fortifications created by the famous kings Saul, David and Solomon are covered, including Gibeah, Jerusalem, Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer, which are described in the Bible. The period of the Divided Monarchy saw the creation of two separate political entities: the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The enemies the two kingdoms faced in this period included Moab, Edom, the Arameans as well as the mighty empires of Assyria, Babylonia and Egypt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f71513794e45b0dee54cc68e59a49477ca37de9","amp;dn":"The+Fortifications+of+Ancient+Israel+and+Judah+1200-586+BC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f71513794e45b0dee54cc68e59a49477ca37de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,113,81,55,148,228,91,13,238,84,204,104,229,154,73,71,124,163,125,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
