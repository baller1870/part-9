It preserves your legal claims to songs and your ability to monetize them. In this course, Rich Stim provides essential guidance to navigate the process and understand the main language, concepts, and business aspects of music copyright.\n\nRich starts by defining what a song copyright and a sound recording copyright areÃ¢â‚¬â€and how they're different.

Then he explains how to get a copyright using the U.S. Copyright Office's online application process. The course wraps up by discussing possible objections that copyright examiners may have, as well as what to do to maintain your copyright and correct any errors that crop up.\n\nTopics include:\n\n    What is a song copyright?\n    Who owns a song?\n    Evaluating cowriters and their contributions\n    Registering a song copyright\n    Maintaining a copyright registration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:301c74ca7d2082126d432d18f09fe431f377aae4","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Music+Law%3A+Copyrighting+a+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"301c74ca7d2082126d432d18f09fe431f377aae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,28,116,202,125,32,130,18,109,67,45,24,240,159,228,49,243,119,170,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
