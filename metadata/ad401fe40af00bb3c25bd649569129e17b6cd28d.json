It does not cover basic use of the editor but focuses on making life easier for experienced Vim users. Vim is a highly configurable, open-source, multi-platform text editor that is included as standard in most Linux distributions. It can edit code in any language, has a scripting language that allows extensions to its functionality, and is editor of choice for many programmers. This book is up to date with the new features in Vim 7.0. Chapters cover: changing the appearance of the Vim editor; improved file and buffer navigation; using templates, auto-completion, folding, sessions, and registers; formatting text and code and using external formatting scripts; Vim scripts and scripting. Each recipe has a self-contained description of the task it covers, how to use it, the benefits of using it, and compatibility with earlier versions of Vim.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad401fe40af00bb3c25bd649569129e17b6cd28d","amp;dn":"Hacking+VIM+by+Packt+Publishing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad401fe40af00bb3c25bd649569129e17b6cd28d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,64,31,228,10,240,11,179,194,91,214,73,86,145,41,225,123,108,210,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
