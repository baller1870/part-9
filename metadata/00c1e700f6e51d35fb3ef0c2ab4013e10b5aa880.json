And the music suffers for it. Perhaps Sixx didn&amp;#039;t want to romanticize     \n          addiction and ill behavior by unleashing a series of rockers that would send fists   \n          high in the air and let the spirit, at least for a moment, soar while the listener   \n          struggled to better understand the seductive lure of dependence and decadence. (If   \n          anyone cares that much--this is rock &amp; roll, after all, and not Oprah.) Instead, Sixx\n          dresses the songs in the trappings of contemporary pop so that &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Life is  \n          Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Accidents Can Happen&quot; sound like lite imitations of the lesser bands \n          that have captured the public&amp;#039;s imagination in the wake of the CrÃƒÂ¼e&amp;#039;s inexplicable   \n          absence from the recording studio. (&quot;Permission&quot; may even be Sixx&amp;#039;s first stab at    \n          getting airplay on CMT.) The true rockers, far too slender in number, are            \n          half-realized and pallid; the lyrics are overly diaristic (yes) and fail to live up  \n          to Sixx&amp;#039;s vintage street sophistication (&quot;Dancing on Glass&quot; and &quot;Kickstart My        \n          Heart&quot;). The Heroin Diaries comes off more like an affectless pity party than a walk \n          on the wild side.                          \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c1e700f6e51d35fb3ef0c2ab4013e10b5aa880","amp;dn":"Sixx_AM-Heroin_Diaries%28Retail%29-2007-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c1e700f6e51d35fb3ef0c2ab4013e10b5aa880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,193,231,0,246,229,29,53,251,62,240,194,171,64,19,225,11,90,168,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
