In this long-awaited sequel, he provides new evidence of the reality of heavens.\n\nDrawing from a lifetime of personal shamanic experiences and more than 2,500 reports of Westerners' experiences during shamanic ascension, Harner highlights the striking similarities between their discoveries, indicating that the heavens and spirits theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve encountered do indeed exist. He also provides instructions on his innovative core-shamanism techniques, so that readers too can ascend to heavenly realms, seek spirit teachers, and return later at will for additional healing and advice.\n\nWritten by the leading authority on shamanism, Cave and Cosmos is a must-read not only for those interested in shamanism, but also for those interested in spirituality, comparative religion, near-death experiences, healing, consciousness, anthropology, and the nature of reality.\n\nPraise for Michael Harner and The Way of the Shaman:\n \n&quot;What Yogananda did for Hinduism and D. T. Suzuki did for Zen, Michael Harner has done for shamanism--namely, bring the tradition and its richness to Western awareness.&quot;\n--from Higher Wisdom, by Roger Walsh and Charles S. Grob\n \n&quot;Wonderful, fascinating.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Harner really knows what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking about.&quot;\n--Carlos Castaneda, best-selling author of The Teachings of Don Juan and The Active Side of Infinity\n \n&quot;An intimate and practical guide to the art of shamanic healing and the technology of the sacred. Michael Harner is not just an anthropologist who has studied shamanism; he is an authentic white shaman.&quot;\n--Stanislav Grof, author of The Adventure of Self-Discovery\n \n&quot;Harner has impeccable credentials, both as an academic and as a practicing shaman. Without doubt (since the recent death of Mircea Eliade) the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading authority on shamanism.&quot;\n--Nevill Drury, author of The Elements of Shamanism\n \n&quot;Michael Harner is a great shaman. He also proves that a person can be both a scientist and a shaman.&quot;\n--Bo Bair Rinchinov, Siberian Buryat shaman\n\n\nAuthor: Michael Harner\nPublisher: North Atlantic Books\nPublication: April 9, 2013\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea2776618b7dc75109376af28bd5b7a15636476","amp;dn":"Michael+Harner+-+Cave+and+Cosmos+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea2776618b7dc75109376af28bd5b7a15636476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,162,119,102,24,183,220,117,16,147,118,175,40,189,91,122,21,99,100,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
