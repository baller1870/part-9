The nature of myth and its importance to ancient Greece in terms of storytelling, music, poetry, religion, cults, rituals, theatre, and literature are viewed through works ranging from Homer's Iliad and Odyssey to the writings of Sophocles and Aeschylus. Through the study of these time-honored myths, the Greek heroes and gods-including Heracles, Zeus, Achilles, Athena, Aphrodite, and others-leap from the page in all their glorious splendor. The following lectures are not only an entertaining guide to Greek mythology, but a fascinating look into the culture and time that produced these eternal tales.\n\nPeter Meineck is a clinical assistant professor of classics and artist in residence at the New York University Center for Ancient Studies and the producing artistic director and founder of the Aquila Theatre Company. Peter currently teaches in the Classics Department at New York University in ancient drama, Greek literature, and Classical mythology. He has held teaching appointments at Princeton University, the University of South Carolina, and the Tisch School of the Arts. Fellowships include the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies, Princeton, the University of California San Diego, and the University of Texas at Austin. He has lectured and held workshops on ancient drama and Shakespeare at conferences, academic institutions, museums, festivals, and schools throughout the world.\n\n14 Lectures\n30 minutes/lecture\n\n1  The Nature of Greek Myth\n2  Religion and Society\n3  In the Beginning There Was Chaos\n4  The Olympians\n5  The Trojan War\n6  Myth as History\n7  Divine Myths\n8  Myths of Identity-The Odyssey\n9  Myths of the Afterlife\n10 Myth into Politics-Agamemnon\n11 Gender in Myth-The Women of Tragedy\n12 Myths of Initiation-The Heroes\n13 Myths of the City-Oedipus\n14 Myths of the City-Athens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dafc3d6bc0710566a5c36c890596be2691c4f22e","amp;dn":"TMS+-+Classical+Mythology+-+The+Greeks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dafc3d6bc0710566a5c36c890596be2691c4f22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,252,61,107,192,113,5,102,165,195,108,137,5,150,190,38,145,196,242,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
