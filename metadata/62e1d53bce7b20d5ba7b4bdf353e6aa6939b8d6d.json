And if you understand the word problem but have no idea where to begin with the math, again, you will not do well.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Physics 2 Tutor, Volume 2 is a focuses on Oscillations and Waves and begins at the very beginning assuming the student has never been exposed to this material. \r\n\r\nThe course then proceeds to introduce new topics in an easy-to-understand fashion. The course is a 4 DVD series, 12 full hours in duration, and contains 13 chapters of material so you can be assured that all of the core topics are covered in detail. What sets this DVD apart from the rest is that the concepts are taught entirely through example problems. The easiest way to learn Physics is to work problems as you learn the material - and that is exactly what this 4 DVD series provides. You will immediately improve your problem-solving skills which will help on homework and exams, and you will have a reference for many of the commonly asked problems in Physics. If you have a problem with your homework, simply find a similar problem fully worked on the Ultimate Physics Tutor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics Covered;\r\n\r\nSection 1: Oscillations and Simple Harmonic Motion - Pt 1\r\nSection 2: Oscillations and Simple Harmonic Motion - Pt 2\r\nSection 3: Conservation of Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion\r\nSection 4: Pendulums and Resonance\r\nSection 5: Transverse Waves - Part 1\r\nSection 6: Transverse Waves - Part 2\r\nSection 7: Superposition and Interference of Waves\r\nSection 8: Standing Waves and Resonance - Part 1\r\nSection 9: Standing Waves and Resonance - Part 2\r\nSection 10: Speed of Sound Waves\r\nSection 11: Traveling Waves\r\nSection 12: Sound Intensity and Sound Level\r\nSection 13: Doppler Shift","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62e1d53bce7b20d5ba7b4bdf353e6aa6939b8d6d","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Physics+Tutor+Course+2.2+-+Oscillations+%26amp%3B+Waves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62e1d53bce7b20d5ba7b4bdf353e6aa6939b8d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,225,213,59,206,123,32,213,186,123,75,223,53,62,106,166,147,155,141,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
