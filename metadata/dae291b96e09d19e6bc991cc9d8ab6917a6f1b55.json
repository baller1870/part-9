Green\r\n\r\n\r\nRupert didn't especially want to be a prince. And he certainly never asked to be the second son of a royal line that really didn't need a spare. So he was sent out to slay a dragon and prove himself-a quest straight out of legend. But he also discovered the kinds of things legends tend to leave out, as well as the usual demons, goblins, the dreaded Night Witch-and even worse terrors hidden in the shadows of Darkwood. Rupert did find a fiery dragon-and a beautiful princess to rescue. But the dragon turned out to be a better friend than anyone back at the castle, and with the evil of Darkwood spreading, Rupert was going to need all the friends he could get.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/books/1438318554l/810881.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae291b96e09d19e6bc991cc9d8ab6917a6f1b55","amp;dn":"Simon+R.+Green-Blue+Moon+Rising","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae291b96e09d19e6bc991cc9d8ab6917a6f1b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,226,145,185,110,9,209,158,107,201,145,204,157,138,182,145,122,111,27,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
