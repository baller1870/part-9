The movie premiered on April 13, 1986, on NBC, and was the highest-rated telemovie of 1986.[1][2] Sixteen of the original cast members reunited for the movie and its success could have led to additional Mayberry programs, but Griffith was committed to Matlock for the 1986-87 season.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:524c152fc516dad4ea8f62afc1a4f490ba5d1eaa","amp;dn":"Return+to+Mayberry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"524c152fc516dad4ea8f62afc1a4f490ba5d1eaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,76,21,47,197,22,218,212,234,143,98,175,193,164,244,144,186,93,30,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
