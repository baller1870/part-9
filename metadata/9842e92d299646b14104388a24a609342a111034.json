Love Away\n\nThe full-length debut album from Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Capital Cities, 2013Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s In a Tidal Wave of Mystery is an infectious mix of synth-heavy dance pop. These musically ambitious productions touch upon Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s new wave and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s disco in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own unique, lo-fi way. In fact, part of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charm is that many of the songs here sound like keyboard-heavy demos that were perhaps meant to be fleshed out with various instruments but never were. Hence, the preponderance of synth trumpet, digital strings, and other extremely old-school-sounding electronic samples. The result is that the album brings to mind the early, innovative electronic music of artists who were earnestly taken with the explicitly computer-generated sounds of the modern wonder that was the synthesizer, like Level 42 and Giorgio Moroder. In that sense, In a Tidal Wave of Mystery fits in nicely alongside the works of such similarly inclined indie pop contemporaries as AM &amp; Shawn Lee, MGMT, Phoenix, and the Strokes' Julian Casablancas' solo work. Featured on the album is the Top Ten radio hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Safe and Sound.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9842e92d299646b14104388a24a609342a111034","amp;dn":"Capital+Cities+-+In+A+Tidal+Wave+of+Mystery+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9842e92d299646b14104388a24a609342a111034","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,66,233,45,41,150,70,177,65,4,56,138,36,166,9,52,42,17,16,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
