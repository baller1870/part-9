Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\n Notes and disclaimers:\n\n It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\n If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts. \n\n Re-upload, by request, of a conversion I did back in 2011. My lone conversion to ever feature a &quot;sort of Easter Egg&quot; surprise.\n\n Enjoy.\n\n DKA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2ca66da1f8ad90405106df0603ad069f2a5965","amp;dn":"Daft+Punk+-Tron+Legacy+Soundtrack+%28SPEC+DTS+5.1+DVD-V+by+DKA%29+%28S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2ca66da1f8ad90405106df0603ad069f2a5965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,44,166,109,161,248,173,144,64,81,6,223,6,3,173,6,159,42,89,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
