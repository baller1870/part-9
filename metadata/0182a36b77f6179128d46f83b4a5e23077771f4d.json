Raised by injuns as a teenager, Blueberry&amp;#039;s upbringing comes in handy when a group of greedy adventurers cross into Indian territory in search of buried treasure. Caught between his lawman&amp;#039;s duty and loyalty to his adopted people, the Marshall finds himself embarking on a drug-fuelled trip into the heart of his own darkness. Looks like the West just swapped wild for weird.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0182a36b77f6179128d46f83b4a5e23077771f4d","amp;dn":"BLUEBERRY.DVDrip.English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0182a36b77f6179128d46f83b4a5e23077771f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,130,163,107,119,246,23,145,40,212,111,131,180,165,226,48,119,119,31,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
