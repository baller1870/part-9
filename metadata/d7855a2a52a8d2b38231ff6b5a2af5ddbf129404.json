This is not the usual cowboy kettle fare! Rather, these are healthy, innovative, gourmet recipes developed by Sheila and her friends over 30 years and served to thousands of whitewater-rafting enthusiasts.\n\nSheila Mills has served as head chef and co-owner (with her husband, David) of rafting outfitter Rocky Mountain River Tours (RockyMountainRiverTours.com) for 30 years. Many of the passengers Sheila and David guide down the Middle Fork of Idaho's Salmon River return year after year, thanks in no small part to Sheila's Dutch oven cooking. The recipes have been featured in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and Every Day with Rachael Ray and have helped establish the company's international reputation.\n\nBook Cover:\nhttp://www.image-upload.net/images/gxayxh8w6ekvzcc89fq.jpg\n\nPLz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7855a2a52a8d2b38231ff6b5a2af5ddbf129404","amp;dn":"Outdoor_Dutch_Oven+Cookbook+2nd+ED+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7855a2a52a8d2b38231ff6b5a2af5ddbf129404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,133,90,42,82,168,210,179,130,49,255,107,90,42,245,221,191,18,148,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
