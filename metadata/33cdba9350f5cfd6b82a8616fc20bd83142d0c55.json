With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits-a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century-denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts. Injecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33cdba9350f5cfd6b82a8616fc20bd83142d0c55","amp;dn":"Steven+Pinker+-+The+Blank+Slate.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33cdba9350f5cfd6b82a8616fc20bd83142d0c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,205,186,147,80,245,207,214,184,42,134,22,252,32,189,131,20,45,12,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
