The title The President of the LSD Golf Club was originally intended for The Magnificent Tree, but the title was not allowed by Sony, Hooverphonic's label at the time. The album has quite a different feel from previous Hooverphonic albums. It was recorded with live musicians and made use of the mellotron, an electronic keyboard popularised by The Beatles' Strawberry Fields Forever. The sound of the album harks back to the psychedelic era of music but clearly retains a sense of modernity. Songs such as Expedition Impossible are also have more of a traditional rock sound, compared to the sound of earlier Hooverphonic work.\n\nCritics were divided on the album, some claiming it grounded Hooverphonic after the mystery of The Magnificent Tree, while others claimed that it was the most &quot;daring and experimental Hooverphonic album&quot; yet. In some countries (like France, Italy, Sweden and Spain), and on iTunes, the album received a special edition release which included &quot;The Perfect Dose&quot;.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01. &quot;Stranger&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n02. &quot;50 Watt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n03. &quot;Expedition Impossible&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n04. &quot;Circles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n05. &quot;Gentle Storm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n06. &quot;The Eclipse Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n07. &quot;Billie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n08. &quot;Black Marble Tiles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:33\n09. &quot;Strictly Out of Phase&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n10. &quot;Bohemian Laughter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n\n--\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron.
