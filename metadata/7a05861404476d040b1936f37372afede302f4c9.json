He showed a clip of the film during an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993) and asked for investors to help him finish the film. He received the money he needed.\n\nChris Rock, Jon Stewart, Brett Butler, David Cross, and Denis Leary all gave C.K. money to make the film. Jerry Seinfeld turned him down. \n\nAccording to C.K., HBO provided him with $50,000 to make a print of the film. C.K. wanted to leave his position at The Chris Rock Show (1997) and Rock told HBO that he would quit the series if C.K. did not return. C.K. told HBO that he would return to the show if they gave him the money to print the film. C.K. was able to take the print to the Sundance Film Festival and returned for another season of the show.\n\n\nIf you enjoy it, please consider buying a comedy special from Louie's site; they're affordable and help him to cover the costs of production which usually come from his own pocket.\n\nI take no credit for anything. Cheers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a05861404476d040b1936f37372afede302f4c9","amp;dn":"Louis+C.K.%27s+Tomorrow+Night+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a05861404476d040b1936f37372afede302f4c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,5,134,20,4,71,109,4,11,25,54,243,115,114,175,237,227,2,244,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
