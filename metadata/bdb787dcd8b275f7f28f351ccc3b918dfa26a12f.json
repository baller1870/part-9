This is hard-driving, unadulterated rock at its finest, at a time when music needs a good rock enema more than ever.\n\nTracks include:\nThere'll always Be an England (intro)\nPretty Vacant\nSeventeen\nNo Feeling\nNew York\nDid You No Wrong\nLiar\nBeside the Seaside\nHolidays in the Sun\nSubmission\n(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone\nNo Fun\nProblems\nGod Save the Queen\nEMI\nBodies\nAnarchy in the UK\nRoad Runner\n\nThe DVD also includes The Knowledge - the Sex Pistols guide to London and John Lydon's open-top bus ride through London. \n\nINFO: \nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 962 MiB\nDuration : 1h 10mn\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 1 907 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf52.104.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : 20\nDuration : 1h 10mn\nBit rate : 1 775 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.171\nStream size : 895 MiB (93%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 10mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 64.6 MiB (7%)\n\nIMDb- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1376785/ \nSIZE: 1.39GB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdb787dcd8b275f7f28f351ccc3b918dfa26a12f","amp;dn":"SEX+PISTOLS-There%27ll+Alway%27s+be+an+England","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdb787dcd8b275f7f28f351ccc3b918dfa26a12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,183,135,220,216,178,117,247,242,143,53,28,204,59,145,141,250,38,161,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
