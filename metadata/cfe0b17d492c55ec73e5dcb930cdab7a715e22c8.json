Masterton/Hurley/Neth's CHEMISTRY: PRINCIPLES AND REACTIONS, 7e, provides a clear, concise presentation based on the authors' more than 50 years of combined teaching experience. The book includes new concept-driven examples, updated examples that focus on molecular reasoning and understanding, and &quot;Chemistry: Beyond the Classroom&quot; essays that demonstrate the relevance of the concepts and highlight some of the most up-to-date uses of chemistry. A strong, enhanced art program helps readers visualize chemical concepts. Integrated end-of-chapter questions and Key Concepts correlate to OWL Online Learning, the #1 online homework and tutorial system for chemistry. OWL also includes an interactive eBook for the 7th edition of the textbook and an optional eBook for the Student Study Guide. Also available are Go Chemistry mini-video lectures and learning tools available for video iPods, personal video players, and iTunes.\n\n# Hardcover: 774 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 7 edition (January 31, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1111427100\n# ISBN-13: 978-1111427108","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe0b17d492c55ec73e5dcb930cdab7a715e22c8","amp;dn":"Chemistry%3A+Principles+and+Reactions%2C7th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe0b17d492c55ec73e5dcb930cdab7a715e22c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,224,177,125,73,44,85,236,115,229,220,185,48,205,171,122,113,94,34,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
