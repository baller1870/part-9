LOL) Is it a complete discography? Well, no, not exactly. Im missing a couple albums here and there. If you have any that are missing, feel free to upload them, it would be appreciated. Lets just say this is the most complete Donny Osmond torrent I could put together for all you fans with what I had available for resources. I originally started all this because I was looking for some Osmond torrents and just didnt find very much available on the network, So I decided to make what I did have available for everyone.. I Even included some album covers I found on the internet this time around, Enjoy!\n\nThese range from His first solo LP The Donny Osmond Album back in 1971 up to some of the newer stuff. As always, please be good about sharing, considerate of others. Keep buying the new things the Osmonds make available to us fans and enjoy listening to these classic oldies but goodies from back in the day... Ill be uploading More Osmond things, including a real nice Osmond Brothers torrent Im getting ready after I see how this does. The Os. Bros. torrent I am working on is twice this size, thus my curiousity how this does on the network, regarding seeds/peers and the whole P2P scene. More from Donny can be found in my Donny and Marie Discography torrent found here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3884518/Donny_and_Marie_Osmond_7_CD_70s_Discography as well as future Osmond torrents.
