And although the two weren't related, Leela was so impacted by her idol's passing that she decided to record a full album of remakes of Etta's songs. The result, Loving You More ... in the Spirit of Etta James, is not only a loving and respectful tribute to one of the best singers in American history, it's an album that Etta herself would likely be flattered by and proud of. Loving You More, is a fitting homage to Etta's musical legacy.\n\nThere literally is not a missed opportunity or a bum note in the whole project. Short, volcanic, and totally uncompromising, much like its mother, the project leaves listeners wanting more and pressing repeat again and again. Etta would be proud. Highly Recommended.\n\n\nThese legends are sometimes forgotten and we got to keep them alive because in my opinion, they represent what music really is and what music is suppose to be. When they are physically no longer with us, their soul is still here so we I feel like itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a duty to keep stuff in peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face and this how IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m doing it. This is how IÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m keeping her soul in peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faces. - Leela James","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037c96849ee1c06d6febc4e7e1f20274f019cd8e","amp;dn":"Leela+James-Loving+You+More+...+in+the+Spirit+of+Etta+James","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037c96849ee1c06d6febc4e7e1f20274f019cd8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,124,150,132,158,225,192,109,111,235,196,231,225,242,2,116,240,25,205,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
