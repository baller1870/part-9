In the gritty new action-drama GANG RELATED, Detective RYAN LOPEZ is a rising star in Los Angeles' elite Gang Task Force. What the world doesn't know is that long before Ryan became a cop, he pledged allegiance to a different band of brothers - a powerful Latino gang called Los Angelicos. When Ryan's best friend and police partner is senselessly killed by a notorious gang member, Ryan teams up with longtime Task Force member CASSIUS GREEN, who has been at the forefront of the city's war on organized crime. In this war between law enforcement and gangs, the series explores how only people who really know the streets can win the battle on the streets. Despite his profession, Ryan is still beholden to the gang's leader, JAVIER ACOSTA, the father figure Ryan has tried to make proud his entire life and the man who masterminded his entry into the police force. It's a secret that has been held for a decade by Ryan, Javier and Javier's sons: cold-blooded gang lieutenant CARLOS; and Ryan's childhood best friend, straight-laced investment banker DANIEL. But Ryan is starting to realize that he is even more dedicated to being a cop than he is to Los Angelicos. He is respected by his team, including TAE KIM, VERONICA &quot;VEE&quot; DOTSEN and Task Force leader SAM CHAPEL, Ryan's other surrogate father figure, whose estranged daughter, JESSICA Hill, is the city's Assistant District Attorney. Ryan's education comes from the streets, and that schooling will work to his advantage, as he, Cassius and the rest of the police unit take aim at the city's most dangerous gangs. While balancing two allegiances, two father figures and two families, Ryan's increasing sense of loyalty to one will help him finally determine which side of the law he is really on.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a601c2efc82440bd34e75414e8760b6713b779f","amp;dn":"Gang.Related.S01E09.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a601c2efc82440bd34e75414e8760b6713b779f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,96,28,46,252,130,68,11,211,78,117,65,78,135,96,182,113,59,119,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
