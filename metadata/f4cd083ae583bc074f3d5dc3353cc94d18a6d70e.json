Led by guitarist Rick Nielsen, the band's early albums were filled with highly melodic, well-written songs that drew equally from the crafted pop of the Beatles, the sonic assault of the Who, and the tongue-in-cheek musical eclecticism and humor of the Move. Their sound provided a blueprint for both power pop and arena rock; it also had a surprisingly long-lived effect on both alternative and heavy metal bands of the '80s and '90s, who often relied on the same combination of loud riffs and catchy melodies. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.89% CDDA &amp; 99.83% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\t512907 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.ELO Kiddies (Single Version)\n02.Hot Love\n03.He's A Whore\n04.Mandocello (With Billy Corgan) (Live)\n05.Clock Strikes Ten\n06.Southern Girls (Single Version)\n07.Downed\n08.Hello There\n09.Surrender\n10.California Man\n11.High Roller\n12.Auf Wiedersehen\n13.I Want You To Want Me (Live)\n14.Ain't That A Shame (Live)\n15.Takin' Me Back\n16.Dream Police\n17.Voices\n18.Gonna Raise Hell (Live)\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Way Of The World\n02.Stop This Game\n03.World's Greatest Lover\n04.Everything Works If You Let It (Full Version)\n05.She's Tight\n06.If You Want My Love (Alternate, Extra Bridge Version)\n07.I Can't Take It\n08.Tonight It's You\n09.This Time Around\n10.The Flame\n11.Had To Make You Mine\n12.I Can't Understand It\n13.Can't Stop Falling Into Love\n14.Walk Away (Feat.
