Dickens creates a vivid picture of England in taking his characters along the nostalgic highways and byways of this majestic isle. This remarkable first novel made Dickens famous and has remained one of the world&amp;#039;s best-known works. With its scores of delightful, improbably-named characters, The Pickwick Papers brims over with joyous fantasy, infectious good humor, and a touch of the macabre.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c2bbbf115d4f3071e0f6fd32b423cf9c50dc9f","amp;dn":"The+Pickwick+Papers+-+by+Charles+Dickens+%2C+read+by+Patrick+Tull+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7c2bbbf115d4f3071e0f6fd32b423cf9c50dc9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,194,187,191,17,93,79,48,113,224,246,253,50,180,35,207,156,80,220,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
