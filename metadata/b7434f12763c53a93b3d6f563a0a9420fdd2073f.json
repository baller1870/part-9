Released on October 24, 2000 through Warner Bros.

Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California and produced by Don Gilmore, the album&amp;#039;s lyrical themes deal mostly with various problems that lead singer Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and initial divorce of his parents.\nFour singles were released from the album: ?Papercut?, ?In The End,? ?One Step Closer?, and the Grammy Award-winning ?Crawling?, the latter three of which were responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. Since its release, Hybrid Theory has been certified diamond by the RIAA, and to date has sold 24 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling debut album of the 21st century. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7434f12763c53a93b3d6f563a0a9420fdd2073f","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Hybrid+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7434f12763c53a93b3d6f563a0a9420fdd2073f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,67,79,18,118,60,83,169,59,61,111,86,58,10,148,32,253,210,7,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
