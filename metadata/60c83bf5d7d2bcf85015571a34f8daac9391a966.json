Whitaker is at the height of his powers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Greg Critser, author of Generation Rx\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Why are so many more people disabled by mental illness than ever before?  Why are those so diagnosed dying 10-25 years earlier than others?  In Anatomy of an Epidemic investigative reporter Robert Whitaker cuts through flawed science, greed and outright lies to reveal that the drugs hailed as the cure for mental disorders instead worsen them over the long term.  But WhitakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation also offers hope for the future: solid science backs natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way of healing our mental ills through time and human relationships.  Whitaker tenderly interviews children and adults who bear witness to the ravages of mental illness, and testify to their newly found Ã¢â‚¬Å“alivenessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when freed from the prison of mind-numbing drugs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Daniel Dorman, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, UCLA School of Medicine and author of DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cure: A Journey Out of Madness\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is the most alarming book IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read in years.  The approach is neither polemical nor ideologically slanted. Relying on medical evidence and historical documentation, Whitaker builds his case like a prosecuting attorney.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Carl Elliott, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Center for Bioethics, University of Minnesota and author of Better than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Anatomy of an Epidemic investigates a profoundly troubling question: do psychiatric medications increase the likelihood that people taking them, far from being helped, are more likely to become chronically ill? In making a compelling case that our current psychotropic drugs are causing as muchÃ¢â‚¬â€if not moreÃ¢â‚¬â€harm than good, Robert Whitaker reviews the scientific literature thoroughly, demonstrating how much of the evidence is on his side. There is nothing unorthodox hereÃ¢â‚¬â€this case is solid and evidence-backed. If psychiatry wants to retain its credibility with the public, it will now have to engage with the scientific argument at the core of this cogently and elegantly written book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€David Healy, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, Cardiff University and author of The Antidepressant Era and Let Them Eat Prozac\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Every so often a book comes along that exposes a vast deceit. Robert Whitaker has written that sort of book. Drawing on a prodigious quantity of psychiatric literature as well as heart-rending stories of individual patients, he exposes a deeply disturbing fraud perpetrated by the drug industry and much of modern psychiatryÃ¢â‚¬â€at horrendous human and financial cost to patients, their families, and society as a whole. Scrupulously reported and written in compelling but unemotional style, this book shreds the myth woven around todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychiatric drugs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Nils Bruzelius, former science editor for the Boston Globe and the Washington Post\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A devastating critique. . . . One day, we will look back at the way we think about and treat mental illness and wonder if we were all mad. Anatomy of an Epidemic should be required reading for both patients and physicians.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Shannon Brownlee, senior research fellow, New America Foundation and author of Overtreated\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nRobert Whitaker is the author of four books: Mad in America, The Mapmaker's Wife, On the Laps of Gods and Anatomy of an Epidemic. His newspaper and magazine articles on the mentally ill and the pharmaceutical industry have garnered several national awards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c83bf5d7d2bcf85015571a34f8daac9391a966","amp;dn":"Anatomy+of+an+Epidemic+-+Robert+Whitaker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c83bf5d7d2bcf85015571a34f8daac9391a966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,200,59,245,215,210,188,248,80,21,87,26,52,248,218,172,147,145,169,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
