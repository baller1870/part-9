It is the history of Congress' First Contact with the sentient species known as the Geuji, and the unspeakable tragedy that befell their entire species in the early history of Congress. It's a SHORT story, approx 8,000 words, and is touted by many to be one of King's best short works. A must-read for fans of the ZERO series!\n\nForging Zero (The Legend of Zero, #1) The Legend of ZERO begins the epic journey of 14-year-old Joe Dobbs in a post-apocalyptic universe following a massive alien invasion of Earth. The oldest of the children drafted from humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devastated planet, Joe is impressed into service by the alien Congressional Ground ForceÃ¢â‚¬â€and becomes the unwitting centerpiece in a millennia-long alien struggle for independence. Once his training begins, one of the elusive and prophetic Trith appears to give Joe a spine chilling prophecy that the universe has been anticipating for millions of years: Joe will be the one to finally shatter the vast alien government known as Congress. And the Trith cannot lie.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nBut first Joe has to make it through bootcamp.\n\nZero Recall (The Legend of Zero, #2) It's been 53 turns after the legendary Commander Zero graduated as a Congie warrior. Joe, now a battle hardened veteran, has spent his life surviving wars he had no right to survive. Yet his real test is coming: New forces are conspiring to start a great war like the universe has never seen, one that would rip apart the very fabric of Congress. Joe is conscripted to fight the very war everyone has been fearing since the rise of the DhashaÃ¢â‚¬â€the war against the legendary Dhasha Vahlin. Unfortunately for Joe, at the same time, other ruthless powers are conspiring to kill him before he fulfills the prophecy of the Trith.\nTo fight the Vahlin, a desperate Congress comes up with a tactic it abandoned millennia agoÃ¢â‚¬â€the use of multi-species groundteams. Joe, now a Prime Commander, is given command of his own team of misfits and pitted against the VahlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces in a war whose casualties are millions-to-one. Can Joe keep his group of aliens from killing each other long enough to make them into a battle-ready team? Will he survive long enough to kill the Vahlin? Or is he destined to destroy Congress, as the Trith have prophesized about him?\n\nZero's Return (The Legend of ZERO, #3) In this apocalyptic addition to the #1 Bestselling Legend of ZERO series, the PlanOps Prime veteran, universal hero, and living legend Joe Dobbs has become an icon of heroism to the Congressional citizenryÃ¢â‚¬â€but his real adventure is only just beginning. Humanity, unwillingly drafted into the alien Congress during its invasion of Earth seventy-four turns before, has done the unthinkable; building devastating genetic weapons that can kill even the oldest Dhasha with ease, planning to take the fight for its freedom to the very Regency itself. Before it can, however, the alien government discovers HumanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plans and retaliates swiftly, killing the experiments, destroying the labs, and reducing EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technologies back to its Stone Age days to serve a Sacred Turn of penance for its sins.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Or does it? As Joe discovers, one lab gets overlooked in the chaos of Judgment. Its leader, Twelve-A, is determined to keep his fellow experiments aliveÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means coercing a jaded, iron-faced Congie into helping themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b0c5839133e6f03a3464922167d2236cab2c75","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Zero+series+by+Sara+King+%28Book+%230.5+-+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b0c5839133e6f03a3464922167d2236cab2c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,176,197,131,145,51,230,240,58,52,100,146,33,103,210,35,108,171,44,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
