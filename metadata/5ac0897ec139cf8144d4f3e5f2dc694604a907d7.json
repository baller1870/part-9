F.O.D. \n\nTake one part Ramones, one part Buzzcocks, and one part Husker Du, and you&amp;#039;ve got the basic foundation of Green Day, a punky, witty, melodic San Francisco Bay area trio who became overnight stars in 1994 when this album, their third overall release and major label debut, catapulted them to the top of the pop charts. Led by guitarist/vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong and their secret weapon, powerhouse drummer Tre Cool, Green Day put &amp;#039;70s and &amp;#039;80s punk in a compact &amp;#039;90s package with songs like &quot;Longview,&quot; &quot;Basket Case,&quot; &quot;Pulling Teeth,&quot; and the hit semi-ballad, &quot;When I Come Around.&quot; One the few modern alternative rock bands with a bona fide sense of humor. \n\n\nEAC extraction logfile from 15.
