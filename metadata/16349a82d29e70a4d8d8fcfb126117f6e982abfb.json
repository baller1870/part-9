The brothers Edwin and Morcar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the respective Earls of Mercia and Northumbria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unravel hints of a conspiracy that could tear the Kingdom apart even as it faces invasion from both north and south. Faced with a seemingly impossible task against foes in and out of the realm, they must struggle to unite the realm or face complete and total annihilation.\n\nA Fall of Kings is a fictional novel set in an alternate timeline of our own history. Venturing down a path of possibilities, it explores what might have happened so many years ago and what those changes could have done to our history. Can England survive the largest invasion the islands has seen since the days of Rome, or will it be crushed by outsiders once and for all?\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16349a82d29e70a4d8d8fcfb126117f6e982abfb","amp;dn":"A+Fall+of+Kings+%28Epub%29+%28StormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16349a82d29e70a4d8d8fcfb126117f6e982abfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,52,154,130,210,158,112,164,216,216,252,251,18,97,23,246,233,130,171,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
