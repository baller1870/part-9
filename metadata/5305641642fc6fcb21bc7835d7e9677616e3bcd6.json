It has been given a &quot;10&quot; rating by the Cartoon Rating Guide for Smart Adults.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/oban.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/oban.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/oban_trailer.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y19/mike18xx/oban_trailer.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB review: (14 October 2006, author: network20_20 from United States) Beautiful animated TV adventure -- Theatrical-quality animation, beautiful design and fun, engaging characters make this a must-watch for anyone interested in this art form. The story, an unexceptionable coming-of-age adventure framed around a series of contests, is consistently enlightened by great dialog and well-rounded characters who grow and change. A myriad of small details--of dress, speech, professions, weather--make for an imagined science fiction world of great richness and charm. The violence is of the cartoon action type, with a fair amount of gunplay but no excessive gore. The animation, by a co-partnership of French and Japanese studios, is simply excellent. This show is too good to be compared with the normal run of United States cartoons.\n\nAll episodes are Jetix TVrips. Torrent also includes Molly Star-Racer promo trailer, final production trailer, and assorted other misc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5305641642fc6fcb21bc7835d7e9677616e3bcd6","amp;dn":"Oban+Star-Racers+1-26+Molly+trailer%2C+extras%2C+complete%2C+TVrip+xvi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5305641642fc6fcb21bc7835d7e9677616e3bcd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,5,100,22,66,252,111,203,33,188,120,53,215,233,103,118,22,227,188,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
