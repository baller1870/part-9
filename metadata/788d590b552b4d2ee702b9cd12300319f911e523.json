The quest to explain the true nature of reality is one of the great scientific detective stories. Clues have been pieced together from deep within the atom, from the event horizon of black holes, and from the far reaches of the cosmos. It may be that that we are part of a cosmic hologram, projected from the edge of the universe. Or that we exist in an infinity of parallel worlds. Your reality may never look quite the same again.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xxgbn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xxgbn&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 58mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.70GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S (BBC HD)\n\nXvid also available from MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788d590b552b4d2ee702b9cd12300319f911e523","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2011+What+is+Reality+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788d590b552b4d2ee702b9cd12300319f911e523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,141,89,11,85,43,77,46,231,2,185,205,18,48,3,25,249,17,229,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
