Prior to HTML5 and CSS3, it was difficult to design complicated animations and transformations. With the advent of HTML5 and CSS3, web design has become much simpler, and the new features that are now available help us design complex web pages with ease. These cool new features will be the standard for the future; hence, it is imperative to learn about them now.\n\nHTML5 and CSS3 Transition, Transformation, and Animation will help you take advantage of the real power behind HTML5 and CSS3 and will give you a good grounding for using it in your own web pages. Each and every code sample and concept is explained in detail, and you will be provided with all the information you need to take your web pages to the next level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ before all your competitors do!\n\nThe book starts by covering the basic concepts of HTML5 and CSS3 such as semantics, Microdata, and the Flexbox model. You will then quickly progress to intermediate concepts such as form elements and some exciting features with JavaScript APIs. The code samples provided in this book will give you a solid base by which you will then be able to understand, write, and execute your own HTML/CSS projects with transition and animations.\n\nInstead of wading through loads of theory, the concepts in this book are explained in a practical manner using code samples to demonstrate the new features of HTML5 and CSS3. The code samples are such that you can copy the code (the entire code is written instead of code snippets) and execute it for better understanding. Transition, transformation, and animation are also explained in a lucid manner, and there is a gradual increase in the difficulty level throughout the book.\n\nBy the end of the book, you will be thoroughly acquainted with HTML5 and CSS3, enabling you to design a web page using the included code samples with ease.\nApproach\n\nThis book is a practical, hands-on guide that provides you with a number of clear, step-by-step exercises moving from a basic level of understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 and gradually progressing to more advanced concepts.\nWho this book is for\n\nHTML5 and CSS3 Transition, Transformation, and Animation is ideal for beginners as well as experienced web designers who want to learn HTML5 and CSS3 concepts. It will serve as a useful guide if you are new to the HTML5 and CSS3 standards and you are looking to build a solid foundation for using the new format.
