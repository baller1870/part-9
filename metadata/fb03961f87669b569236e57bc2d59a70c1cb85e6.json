It was recorded in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hometown of Melbourne and self-produced by Dan Whitford with mixing by Dave Fridmann (Tame Impala, MGMT, the Flaming Lips) in upstate New York. The 14-track effort was influenced by San FranciscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Summer of Love in 1967 and BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Second Summer of Love in 1988. As the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s press release notes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The concept of freedom is one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s universally positive and timeless, and whatever each personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of that freedom is, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good thing to be reminding people or even just ourselves to be Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfree.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nFree Your Mind Tracklist:\n01.
