Their mission is to study from orbit the two species of intelligent lifeforms on the surface. The first: an isolated people embarking on civilization and building their world's first city. The second: a brutal race of massive predators, spread thick and still growing across the dominant landmass - destined to breed and eat their way to extinction within a few centuries.\r\n\r\nAfter eight years of observation, disaster strikes the orbiting station, and only two crewmembers eject successfully. Drifting down through a dark, alien sky, the pair realizes their escape pod launched not toward the safety of the city but to the other side of the planet, touching down deep inside a land no human could possibly survive.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Julia Whelan\r\nLength: 14 hrs and 23 mins\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:01-26-16\r\nPublisher: Podium Publishing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb39525b4461ea935d2b5ec84187c6eb47a7a077","amp;dn":"Michael+Siemsen+-+Exigency","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb39525b4461ea935d2b5ec84187c6eb47a7a077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,57,82,91,68,97,234,147,93,43,94,200,65,135,198,235,71,167,160,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
