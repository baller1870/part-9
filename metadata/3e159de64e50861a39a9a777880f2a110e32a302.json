Explore the controlled explosion of launch, the fiery crucible of reentry and everything in between. See how a single spark inside a spacecraft or a micrometeoroid less than an inch wide hitting a space station can turn a routine mission into a lethal nightmare. As the missions become longer, venturing to Mars and beyond, the potential disasters will only become bigger. What would happen if a spacecraft ventured too close to a black hole or was hit by a gamma ray burst?                                                                  ___________________________________________________\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHistory.Channel.The.Universe.S03E02.Parallel Universes.720p.HDTV.x264-DHD\n\nLENGTH         = 44:27 Minutes  \nRESOLUTiON     = 1280x720 \nFRAMERATE      = 23.976 fps  \n\n\n                               SUMMARY\nSome of the world&amp;#039;s leading physicists believe they have found startling\nnew evidence showing the existence of universes other than our own. One\npossibility is that the universe is so vast that an exact replica of our\nSolar System, our planet and ourselves exists many times over. These\nDoppelganger Universes exist within our own Universe; in what scientist\nnow call &quot;The Multiverse.&quot; Today, trailblazing experiments by state of\nthe art particle colliders are looking for evidence of higher dimensions\nand Parallel Universes. If proof is found, it will change our lives, our\nminds, our planet, our science and our universe.\n\n                            RELEASE NOTES \nHistory Channel broadcasts with some black pixel on all sides.  x264 rules \nstate to leave as broadcasted and not crop-resize.
