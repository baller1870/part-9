In 1990 he formed his own EBM band &quot;Terminal Warfare&quot; in which\nhe was the lead singer and has composed the songs. He then joined the local\nband &quot;Whippet of Trench&quot; as a keyboard player besides his own project one year later.\nDue to him being a multi-instrumentalist, he was asked to play guitar/bass and keyboards for a couple of shows with the local industrial band &quot;The Unkown&quot; in 1993.\nAs an enthusiastic fan of death-metal, he also found himself in loose collaborations with local death-metal bands as an audio-engineer/guitarist for their demo-recordings in the studio.\n\nIn 1994 Xenomorph was born and the first demo-tape called &quot;Through the revealed heart&quot; contained 6 songs which were given to all kinds of DJs like Steve Mason or Westbam to get their feedback. The early goa-labels did not really like the music until in 1996 Koyote Records have expressed their interest to release Xenomorph&amp;#039;s debut single/EP followed by the first album &quot;Cassandra&amp;#039;s Nightmare&quot;, which was a world-wide success.\n\nXenomorph has produced numerous contributions to VA compilations for labels like Acidance Records,Mechanik Sound Records and Shaffel Records.\nIn 2000 he collaborated with the israeli artist SKAZI on 2 songs of his debut album during his tour in israel.\n\nAfter a long time of inspiration the second Xenomorph album &quot;Qlippoth&quot; was released\nin 2003 on Gnostic Records which is Xenomorph&amp;#039;s own record label.\nUntil today Xenomorph has continued to produce cutting-edge dark electronic music\nand he has done the mastering post-production for more than 20 releases of various\nlabels including Spun Records, Manic Dragon, Peak Records and Acidance Records.\nIn 2006 there will be a 3rd Xenomorph Album and the debut album for his guitar side\nproject as well as various artists compilation tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd274f67f6843cd0892d0b51e84f2419679875e","amp;dn":"Xenomorph+-+Qlippoth+%5Bgnostic+records+2003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd274f67f6843cd0892d0b51e84f2419679875e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,210,116,246,127,104,67,205,8,146,208,181,30,132,242,65,150,121,135,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
