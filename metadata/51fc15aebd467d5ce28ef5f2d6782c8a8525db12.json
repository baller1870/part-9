It's the sort of undertaking the press does very well. The first such dictionary, as compiled by Oxford, was published in 1953, and it's been tweaking, modifying, and updating it ever since. The fifth edition offers well over 20,000 quotations from more than 3,000 authors. The quotations are arranged alphabetically, by author, so browsing provides insight into the authors quoted, more so than do compendiums that are organize by theme.\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fc15aebd467d5ce28ef5f2d6782c8a8525db12","amp;dn":"The+Dictionary+of+Quotations-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fc15aebd467d5ce28ef5f2d6782c8a8525db12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,252,21,174,189,70,125,92,226,142,245,242,214,120,44,138,133,37,219,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
