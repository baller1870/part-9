Heinz's introduction precedes a chronological tour through Wright's houses with several buildings explored in depth, including the Susan Lawrence Dana House, the Ward Willits House, and the later, more expansive, Barnsdall House. His 'Usonian' period is examined together with the fabrics, rugs and colours which Wright worked on concurrently.
