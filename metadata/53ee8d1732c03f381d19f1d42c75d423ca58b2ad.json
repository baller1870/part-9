Schwartz has spent his career studying the human brain. He pioneered the first mindfulness-based treatment program for people suffering from OCD, teaching patients how to achieve long-term relief from their compulsions. \nSchwartz works with psychiatrist Rebecca Gladding to refine a program that successfully explains how the brain works and why we often feel besieged by overactive brain circuits (i.e. bad habits, social anxieties, etc.) the key to making life changes that you wantÃ¢â‚¬â€to make your brain work for youÃ¢â‚¬â€is to consciously choose to Ã¢â‚¬Å“starveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ these circuits of focused attention, thereby decreasing their influence and strength. \nYou Are Not Your Brain carefully outlines their program, showing readers how to identify negative impulses, channel them through the power of focused attention, and ultimately lead more fulfilling and empowered lives.\nGenre: Psychology, Self-Help","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53ee8d1732c03f381d19f1d42c75d423ca58b2ad","amp;dn":"You+Are+Not+Your+Brain+-+Jeffrey+M.+Schwartz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53ee8d1732c03f381d19f1d42c75d423ca58b2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,238,141,23,50,192,63,56,29,25,241,212,44,117,212,35,202,88,178,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
