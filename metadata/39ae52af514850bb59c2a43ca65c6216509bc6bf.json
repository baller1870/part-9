Is it inevitable that disaster will someday strike America on an \nunprecedented level? How has history prepared us? History's most dramatic events--\nHiroshima, 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and others--are examined and analyzed with hard \ndata gathered from their massive aftereffects. The disappearance of water and food \nsupplies, the effects of deteriorated sanitation and health care on the remaining \npopulation, and the increased use of violence as a means of survival--all illustrate \nhow societies have responded and survived.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ae52af514850bb59c2a43ca65c6216509bc6bf","amp;dn":"After.Armageddon.HDTV.XviD-BiLDeRBeRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ae52af514850bb59c2a43ca65c6216509bc6bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,174,82,175,81,72,80,187,89,194,164,60,166,92,98,22,80,155,198,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
