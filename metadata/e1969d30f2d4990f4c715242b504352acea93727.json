Records; it was produced by \nMike Elizondo and mixed in New York City by noted engineer Andy Wallace. \nNightmare is the first Avenged Sevenfold record without James &quot;The Rev&quot; \nSullivan performing drums because of his death in December 2009, although \nhe wrote some of the songs before that time and is therefore the last studio \nalbum on which he contributed; as a tribute, The Rev's vocals are still on the \nalbum. Mike Portnoy, from Dream Theater, who performed as the drummer for the \nalbum in his place, will also play with the band for all the upcoming tours \nthrough the end of 2010. Avenged Sevenfold, along with Disturbed, will co-headline \nthe first annual Uproar Festival.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.\t&quot;Nightmare&quot;  \t\t\t6:18\n2.\t&quot;Welcome to the Family&quot;  \t4:07\n3.\t&quot;Danger Line&quot;  \t\t\t5:30\n4.\t&quot;Buried Alive&quot;  \t\t6:43\n5.\t&quot;Natural Born Killer&quot;  \t\t5:17\n6.\t&quot;So Far Away&quot;  \t\t\t5:29\n7.\t&quot;God Hates Us&quot;  \t\t5:21\n8.\t&quot;Victim&quot;  \t\t\t7:31\n9.\t&quot;Tonight the World Dies&quot;  \t4:43\n10.\t&quot;Fiction&quot;  \t\t\t5:14\n11.\t&quot;Save Me&quot;  \t\t\t10:56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1969d30f2d4990f4c715242b504352acea93727","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold+-+Nightmare+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1969d30f2d4990f4c715242b504352acea93727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,150,157,48,242,212,153,15,76,113,82,66,181,4,53,42,206,169,55,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
