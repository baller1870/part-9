Renaissance art, perceived as a royalty of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by the absorption of recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by application of contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early modern age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95355e533a80872e9950bbf7ba93dc75b9a46efb","amp;dn":"The++Renaissance+art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95355e533a80872e9950bbf7ba93dc75b9a46efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,53,94,83,58,128,135,46,153,80,187,247,186,147,220,117,185,164,110,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
