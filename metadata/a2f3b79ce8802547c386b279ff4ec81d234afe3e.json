In the edited clean version of the song, the word &quot;fuck&quot; is replaced with &quot;love&quot;, &quot;pole&quot; replaced with &quot;floor&quot;, and a line in the chorus is rewritten.&quot;Pussy&quot; and &quot;nigga&quot; are played backwards, and &quot;dick&quot; and &quot;titties&quot; are blanked out. \n\nHowever, despite the self-censorship, a Parental Advisory sticker was still printed on the cover. The song was originally made by Plies, an up-and-coming rapper from Fort Myers, Florida, but his verse was replaced by Snoop's for reasons explained below.[citation needed] Even his name has been left out from the writers' credits.[citation needed] This song was #88 on MTV AsiaÃ¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹s list of Top 100 Hits of 2007.[1] The song was nominated for the Grammy Award given to the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in the 50th Grammy Awards of 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f3b79ce8802547c386b279ff4ec81d234afe3e","amp;dn":"Akon+-+I+Wanna+Fuck+You+%28feat.+Snoop+dogg%29.flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f3b79ce8802547c386b279ff4ec81d234afe3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,243,183,156,232,128,37,71,195,134,178,121,255,78,200,29,35,74,254,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
