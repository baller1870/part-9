Date: July 2008\n* ISBN-13: 9780307269195\n* 192pp\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn 1982, having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing, Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even more importantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on his writing.\n\nEqual parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from TokyoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back.\n\nBy turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in running.\n\nReview\n\nMurakami is neither a conventional novelist nor a conventional memoirist. In this work whose title was inspired by Raymond Carver's short story collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, he explores how running has shaped his life. The best memoirs inform readers and enlighten them; this memoir contains practical philosophy from a man whose insight into his own character, and how running both suits and shapes that character, is revelatory and can provide tools for readers to examine and improve their own lives. Murakami wrote most of it between 2005 and 2006, but a key chapter from 1996 reinforces his later examination of his own development and the cadence of his life. This book will be appreciated by runners (as well as Murakami's usual readership) because it is ostensibly about running, but anyone interested in the processes of writing and self-examination will also be well served by it. Highly recommended for all collections - Audrey Snowden - Library Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e036902458277021de0875f953a2c08364f39ee0","amp;dn":"Haruki+Murakami+-+What+I+Talk+About+When+I+Talk+About+Running","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e036902458277021de0875f953a2c08364f39ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,54,144,36,88,39,112,33,222,8,117,249,83,162,192,131,100,243,158,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
