Some include up to 30 or so types of hits.\nThis makes it possible to play each instrument with much more\nrealistic range. In some cases, it will not be even possible to\ndetect if samples played in some piece of music are not real instruments.\n\nFor example, a conga set contains over 40 diferent hits.\nOn the top of it, several different conga sets were recorded\nto give you even a broader range of sounds. Some of the best\ncongas, Sol, are presented.\n\nThe accent is placed not to create the typical hits you can find\nin plenty of sample libraries, but to create a largest possible variety\nof sounds.\n\nRecording was done using some of the best microphones available,\nsuch as Microtech Geffel UM-70 and AKG-460.\n\nRecording was done directly to digital recorder.\n\nThese samples are copyrighted but permission is given to all Osho\nmusicians to use them for free. Who knows, may be one day...\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c1806b4c7111aeb217378a9ec97be6a4381243","amp;dn":"Osho+Musicians+-+Veeren+-++World+Percussion+Sample+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c1806b4c7111aeb217378a9ec97be6a4381243","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,193,128,107,76,113,17,174,178,23,55,138,158,201,123,230,164,56,18,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
