Technology had moved on though, and this time there would be no stalemate. The Blitzkrieg tactics of the Nazis, the area bombing strategy of the Allies, and the territorial aspirations of an industrialized Japan meant that this was going to be Total War--as never seen before--and on a truly global scale.\nBrought to life through the use of carefully selected, rarely seen and unforgettable archive footage, the darkest chapters of European history are revealed. From Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia to the surrender of Japan--this is the complete story.\n\nKeep in mind that this is in two parts, and that both parts have the same intro.\n\nIf you need a seed, PM me here: http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=74567","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978891f4cb63bc5a2e24679f1b1dec1daa6a4e6c","amp;dn":"History+of+World+War+II+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978891f4cb63bc5a2e24679f1b1dec1daa6a4e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,136,145,244,203,99,188,90,46,36,103,159,27,29,236,29,170,106,78,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
