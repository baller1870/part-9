This practically oriented textbook covers the important aspects of VLSI design using a top-down approach, reflecting the way digital circuits are actually designed. Using practical hints and tips, case studies and checklists, this comprehensive guide to how and when to design VLSI circuits, covers the advances, challenges and past mistakes in design, acting as an introduction to graduate students and a reference for practising electronic engineers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2aab63c1b5b7bec5c02d0623dd78bde10651b3","amp;dn":"Digital+Integrated+Circuit+Design%3A+From+VLSI+Architectures+to+CM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2aab63c1b5b7bec5c02d0623dd78bde10651b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,42,171,99,193,181,183,190,197,192,45,6,35,221,120,189,225,6,81,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
