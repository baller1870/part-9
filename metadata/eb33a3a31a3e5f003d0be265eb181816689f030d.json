Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.  The extraordinary literary celebrity he attained drew comparisons with Mark Twain and Charles Dickens. \n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories but is best known for his novels such as ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE (1970) and LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA (1988).  His works achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations.  His novels have reportedly outsold everything published in Spanish except the Bible.\n\n\nThese four recently-published biographies are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* Gerald Martin - GABRIEL GARCIÃŒï¿½A MAÃŒï¿½RQUEZ: A LIFE (Knopf, 2009). -- ePUB + MOBI\n\n* Susan Muaddi Darraj - GABRIEL GARCIÃŒï¿½A MAÃŒï¿½RQUEZ (Chelsea House, 2006).\n\n* RubÃƒÂ©n Pelayo - GABRIEL GARCIÃŒï¿½A MAÃŒï¿½RQUEZ: A BIOGRAPHY (Greenwood, 2009).\n\n* Ilan Stavans - GABRIEL GARCIÃŒï¿½A MAÃŒï¿½RQUEZ: THE EARLY YEARS (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010).\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
