Covers SB-900, SB-800, SB-600, CLS.\n\nDVD Rip to DIVX AVI, 720x480, ~98 minutes.\n\n\nDecent instructional video, a bit dry at times.  Although I prefer the Nikon Guide to creative lighting (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5180584/Nikon_School_-_Guide_to_Creative_Lighting_-_Full) which offers more interesting setups and situations - this DVD does go more into more detail using and setting up speedlights in various modes, CLS, etc.\n\n\n===\n\n\nConfused after reading the manual? You are not alone. This DVD simplifies the Nikon Creative Lighting System so you can take the photos you want.\n\nYour new SB Speedlight from Nikon can be the most powerful accessory in your bag! A basic understanding of the Speedlight controls is essential. This DVD takes you, step by step, through the operation of each Speedlight. Your host, Tim Mantoani, demonstrates these fabulous flash units in a series of real world examples. Whether you own one Speedlight or a hundred, this methodical approach will help you create the best photograph possible.\n\nTopics covered:\n\n* Flash output level compensation\n\n* TTL-BL vs. traditional fill flash\n\n* Camera exposure and flash output interaction\n\n* Controlling hard and soft light\n\n* Slow sync demystified\n\n* Auto and manual zoom control\n\n* TTL and manual flash mode\n\n* Flash value lock\n\n* Commander Mode\n\n* Inverse square law and light fall-off\n\n* Wireless operation\n\n* Groups A, B, and C\n\n* Front and rear curtain sync\n\n* Custom settings\n\n* And much more!\n\nThis DVD picks up where your manual leaves off, helping you to integrate flash photography into your image-making arsenal.\n\nTim Mantoani has been a professional photographer for over twenty years.
