The Hero s Journey examines the questions: How can you live a meaningful life? What is the deepest life you are called to, and how can you respond to that call? It is about how to discover your calling and how to embark on the path of learning and transformation that will reconnect you with your spirit, change negative beliefs and habits, heal emotional wounds and physical symptoms, deepen intimacy, and improve self-image and self-love. Along this path we inevitably meet challenges and confronting these challenges forces us to develop and think in new ways and push us outside our comfort zone. The book takes the form of a transcript of a four day workshop conducted by Stephen and Robert. It is a powerful way of learning as you are so absorbed by the experiences of the participants that you feel you are actually there. A wonderful voyage of discovery for everyone who thinks that, there must be more to life than this .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb0cacf36f7104725d57412255ddeb77648d045","amp;dn":"Robert+Dilts+-+Hero%27s+Journey+%26amp%3B+the+5+Rhythms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb0cacf36f7104725d57412255ddeb77648d045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,176,202,207,54,247,16,71,37,213,116,18,37,93,222,183,118,72,208,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
