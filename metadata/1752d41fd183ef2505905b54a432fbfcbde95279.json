Playing was her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€Duane Allman, who would become one of the most influential and sought-after musicians of his time. Just a few short years into his remarkable career, he was killed in a motorcycle accident at the age of twenty-four. His daughter was two years old.\n \nGaladrielle was raised in the shadow of his loss and his fame. Her mother sought solace in a bohemian life. Friends and family found it too painful to talk about Duane. Galadrielle listened intently to his music, read articles about him, steeped herself in the mythic stories, and yet the spotlight rendered him too simple and too perfect to know. She felt a strange kinship to the fans who longed for him, but she needed to know more. It took her many years to accept that his life and his legacy were hers, and when she did, she began to ask for storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€from family, fellow musicians, friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€and they began to flow. \n \nGaladrielle AllmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir is at once a rapturous, riveting, and intimate account of one of the greatest guitar prodigies of all time, the story of the birth of a band that redefined the American musical landscape, and a tender inquiry of a daughter searching for her father in the memories of others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1752d41fd183ef2505905b54a432fbfcbde95279","amp;dn":"Please+Be+with+Me-+Duane+Allman+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1752d41fd183ef2505905b54a432fbfcbde95279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,82,212,31,209,131,239,37,5,144,91,84,164,50,251,252,189,233,82,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
