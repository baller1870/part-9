It was a tough moment for LAKE whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recorded six albums together, and while neither party felt that this was the end of a relationship, it left a distinct void, a void they had to work around.\n\nThe remaining members headed back to the studio, this time in Anacortes at the Unknown studio, with longtime friend and oft-producer Karl Blau. The process of recording this album was described as therapeutic, a way of channeling their artistic energy into something new. They would be would be working in new and different ways that challenged everyone in the band. Most notably they arrived in the studio with little more than scraps of songs.\n\nThe album was recorded in just a handful of days, and without a catalog of well rehearsed and developed songs, the band began working in an off the cuff fashion, making many more discoveries at the time of recording than ever before. Most if not all songs were written collectively, including the lyrics. At times Eli Moore, Markly Morrison, Andrew Dorsett and guest Paul Adam Benson (Ever Ending Kicks) would record music while, Ashley Eriksson sat outside on the steps of the Unknown, an old converted church that watches over the city of Anacortes, polishing up the lyrics.\n\nThe final result is Circular Doorway, LAKEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most mystical and flowing album. The songs almost seem to have a life of their own, growing and morphing, appearing to break free from any restraints and only by some stroke of luck are snared by the band and kept under control. Any song at any moment might change trajectory and veer into uncharted territory, resulting in something overflowing with spontaneous emotion.\n\nThe best example of this is the albums title track, Circular Doorway, which begins light and airy, ErikssonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice fills unexpected keys in a way that reminded me of the bands first, self-titled album, also recorded in Anacortes (at the Department of Safety), also with Karl Blau. But midway through, the songs seems to deconstruct itself, the sound devolves into this instrumental landscape of jazzy perfection. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at that moment where the song shifts, that you know to expect anything from Circular Doorway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f49cbbf66e63f9151d87ad4fbd0bd891f48d5cdd","amp;dn":"LAKE+-+Circular+Doorway+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f49cbbf66e63f9151d87ad4fbd0bd891f48d5cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,156,187,246,110,99,249,21,29,135,173,79,189,11,216,145,244,141,92,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
