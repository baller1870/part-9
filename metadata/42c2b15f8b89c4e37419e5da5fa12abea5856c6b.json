Elektra Records signed the band the following year, at which point the album was remixed and partially re-recorded. \n\nThis re-release, with a different track listing and slightly different artwork (e.g., red lettering on the cover and a different interior photograph of the band), has become the standard version from which all later reissues derive. The original mix of the album remained unreleased on CD until 2003, when it was included in the Music to Crash Your Car to: Vol. 1 box set compilation.\n\nWhile the album only reached number 77# on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States, it would ultimately reach platinum status.\n\nThe song &quot;Live Wire&quot; was released as a single for the album.\n\nThe album cover is a tribute to The Rolling Stones' album Sticky Fingers.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t \t\n1.  &quot;Live Wire&quot;   \t                                        3:14\n2.  &quot;Come on and Dance&quot;   \t                                2:47\n3.  &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot;                                   \t4:22\n4.  &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;   \t                                        3:43\n5.  &quot;Take Me to the Top&quot;   \t                                3:43\n6.  &quot;Piece of Your Action&quot;  \t                                4:39\n7.  &quot;Starry Eyes&quot;   \t                                        4:28\n8.  &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;   \t                                3:22\n9.  &quot;On with the Show&quot;  \t                                4:07\n\n+ 2003 MÃƒÂ¶tley Records re-release bonus tracks\n \t \t\n10. &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; b-side 1981&quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; single) 3:35\n11. &quot;Tonight&quot; (Eric Carmen) \t                                4:27\n12. &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; (alternate intro) \t                4:19\n13. &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;   \t                                4:23\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c2b15f8b89c4e37419e5da5fa12abea5856c6b","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+1981+-+Too+Fast+For+Love%28Remastered%29%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7EReno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c2b15f8b89c4e37419e5da5fa12abea5856c6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,194,177,95,139,137,196,227,116,25,229,218,95,161,42,190,165,133,108,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
