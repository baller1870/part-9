Collings, Christa Critchley, &quot;Artificial Photosynthesis: From Basic Biology to Industrial Application&quot;\nEnglish | 2005-09-30 | ISBN: 3527310908 | 340 pages | PDF | 6.3 mb\n\nSince the events crucial to plant photosynthesis are now known in molecular detail, this process is no longer nature's secret, but can for the first time be mimicked by technology. Broad in its scope, this book spans the basics of biological photosynthesis right up to the current approaches for its technical exploitation, making it the most complete resource on artificial photosynthesis ever published.\nThe contents draw on the expertise of the Australian Artificial Photosynthesis Network, currently the world's largest coordinated research effort to develop effective photosynthesis technology. This is further backed by expert contributions from around the globe, providing an authoritative overview of current research worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5453e590955e49a279e37db6645b048b606717d4","amp;dn":"Artificial+Photosynthesis%3A++Basic+Biology+to+Industrial+Applicat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5453e590955e49a279e37db6645b048b606717d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,83,229,144,149,94,73,162,121,227,125,182,100,91,4,139,96,103,23,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
