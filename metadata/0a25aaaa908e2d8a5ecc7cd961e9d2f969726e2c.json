He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for three years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.\n\nCall it Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zen and the Art of FarmingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little Green BookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Masanobu FukuokaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manifesto about farming, eating, and the limits of human knowledge presents a radical challenge to the global systems we rely on for our food. At the same time, it is a spiritual memoir of a man whose innovative system of cultivating the earth reflects a deep faith in the wholeness and balance of the natural world. As Wendell Berry writes in his preface, the book Ã¢â‚¬Å“is valuable to us because it is at once practical and philosophical. It is an inspiring, necessary book about agriculture because it is not just about agriculture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOnly the ignorant could write off Fukuoka, who died two years ago at the age of 95, as a deluded or nostalgic dreamerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Fukuoka developed ideas that went against the conventional grainÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Long before the American Michael Pollan, he was making the connections between intensive agriculture, unhealthy eating habits and a whole destructive economy based on oil.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Harry Eyres, The Financial Times\n\nEvery now and then you read a book which is so inspiring and such a pleasure that you feel impelled to stride down the street shouting Ã¢â‚¬Å“read this!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Well, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just read The One-Straw Revolution and I urge everyone to buy or borrow a copy without delay.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Tom Hodgkinson, The Idler\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming, Edited by LARRY KORN, Translated from the Japanese by Larry Korn, Chris Pearce, and Tsune Kurosawe, Preface by WENDELL BERRY, Introduction by FRANCES MOORE LAPPÃƒâ€° - ePUB, Pg. 224\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the follwing articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.onestrawrevolution.net/One_Straw_Revolution/One-Straw_Revolution.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.onestrawrevolution.net/One_Straw_Revolution/One-Straw_Revolution.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-one-straw-revolution/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-one-straw-revolution/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a25aaaa908e2d8a5ecc7cd961e9d2f969726e2c","amp;dn":"The+One-Straw+Revolution+%282009%2C+NYRB+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a25aaaa908e2d8a5ecc7cd961e9d2f969726e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,37,170,170,144,142,45,138,94,204,124,217,97,233,210,249,105,114,110,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
