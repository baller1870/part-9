Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\nCalifornication produced several hits for the band, including &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Californication&quot; and the Grammy AwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“winning &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide; a revitalization in comparison to their previous album, One Hot Minute. The record marked a change in style for the band; Rolling Stone's Greg Tate noted that &quot;while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic.&quot;\n\n\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Red Hot Chili Peppers       \nAlbum     -  Californication                                          \nGenre     -  Alternative Rock                                             \nLabel     -  Warner Bros.\nYear      -  1999                                            \nTracks    -  15                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  103 MB\nkbps      -  256\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nEnjoy.
