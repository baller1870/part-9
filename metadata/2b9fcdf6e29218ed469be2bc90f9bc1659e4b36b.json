In these pages we meet real-life vampires, doppelgangers, witches and magicians; and we learn about elemental theory, Odic forces, Atlantis, ley lines, UFOs, crop circles, Velikovsky's 'worlds in collision' theory of the origins of the planet Venus - and much else besides. Anyone who loves the mystery and excitement of vampires, werewolves, psychics and other supernatural occurrences will enjoy this book. An authoritative yet entertaining author, Colin Wilson tells you everything you ever needed to know in a book that you'll love to read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b9fcdf6e29218ed469be2bc90f9bc1659e4b36b","amp;dn":"The+Supernatural+by+Colin+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b9fcdf6e29218ed469be2bc90f9bc1659e4b36b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,159,205,246,226,146,24,237,70,155,226,188,144,249,188,22,89,228,179,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
