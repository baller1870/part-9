If, as Billy Strayhorn said, Duke \n\nEllington's band was his instrument, then this 1961 session finds \n\nEllington and Count Basie &quot;trading fours,&quot; as it were. The composer \n\ncredits and solo space are divided democratically, to say the least--four \n\nsongs from Duke's camp, four from Basie's. The sparring between soloists \n\nof both bands is a pure delight, especially the gentle conversations \n\nbetween the two leaders-pianists, who finish each other's thoughts as if \n\nall four hands were attached to one unified torso. Highlights include two \n\nengaging new Duke compositions--the blistering opener &quot;Battle Royal&quot; and \n\nthe impulsive &quot;Wild Man&quot;--and the closing Basie chestnut &quot;Jumpin' at the \n\nWoodside,&quot; on which the lead tenors Frank Foster and Paul Gonsalves \n\nengage in ferocious dueling. Amazingly, there is no toe-stepping amid the \n\nrousing interplay. --Marc Greilsamer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753f2d05931af41d06509b4c064ca845330dc480","amp;dn":"Ellington+%26+Basie+-+First+Time%21+The+Count+Meets+The+Duke+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753f2d05931af41d06509b4c064ca845330dc480","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,63,45,5,147,26,244,29,6,80,155,76,6,76,168,69,51,13,196,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
