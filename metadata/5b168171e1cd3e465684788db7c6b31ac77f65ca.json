Hope you like them!\n\nGame Name: Wii Chicken Shoot\nGame ID  : [RCSP7J]\nLanguage : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType     : Shooter (apparently very bad from reviews, but I thought it was OK!)\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each, not just leech and run, so that others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 700+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard - that was so crap I deleted it straight away, so not got that anyway!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b168171e1cd3e465684788db7c6b31ac77f65ca","amp;dn":"Wii+Chicken+Shoot+%5BRCSP7J%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b168171e1cd3e465684788db7c6b31ac77f65ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,22,129,113,225,205,62,70,86,132,120,141,183,198,179,26,199,127,101,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
