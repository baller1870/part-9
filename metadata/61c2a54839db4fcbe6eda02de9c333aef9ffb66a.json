Almost 112 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a very good balanced professional board tape that \r\nfavors bass and drums. Some sections are a bit overpowering.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 - Rock And Roll\r\n02 - Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n03 - Black Dog\r\n04 - Misty Mountain Hop\r\n05 - Since I've Been Loving You\r\n06 - Dancing Days\r\n07 - Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\r\n08 - The Song Remains The Same\r\n09 - The Rain Song\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 - Dazed And Confused\r\n02 - Stairway To Heaven\r\n03 - Whole Lotta Love\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nFirst, the sound here is exceptional. Secondly, even though the entire \r\nband is playing incredibly well, Bonham is amazing, using different and \r\nunique fills and playing in every song. Black Dog received very confusing \r\nintroduction from the side of Plant: &quot;This is a song about a Labrador that \r\nused to come with when we went shooting people ... we don't shoot animals!&quot; \r\nWhole Lotta Love includes Hendrix's Voodoo Chile and contains some really \r\ndifferent playing, singing, and drumming, making it one of the best! Overall, \r\neven though Robert's voice is still recovering from the flu, this show is \r\nwonderful and relaxed, and the band makes some great music here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61c2a54839db4fcbe6eda02de9c333aef9ffb66a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.01.15+Stoke%2C+England+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61c2a54839db4fcbe6eda02de9c333aef9ffb66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,194,165,72,57,219,79,203,230,237,160,45,233,195,51,174,249,255,182,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
