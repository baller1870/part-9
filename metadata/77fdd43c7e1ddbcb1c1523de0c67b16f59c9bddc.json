From medical ethics to criminology, from the systemic anti-Semitism of legal codes arising in Christian cultures, to the details of intellectual property debates about regulating the use of culturally significant objects, the contributors (from the fields of law, philosophy, criminology, cultural studies, and literary studies) demonstrate and enact the sort of creativity that Nietzsche associated with the free-spirits to whom he addressed some of his most significant work.\n\nContributors: Friedrich Balke, Marinos Diamantides, Tatiana Flessas, Adam Gearey, Peter Goodrich, Anton Schutz, Mariana Valverde, Richard Weisberg, Jonathan Yovel\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fdd43c7e1ddbcb1c1523de0c67b16f59c9bddc","amp;dn":"Nietzsche+and+Legal+Theory+%28Goodrich+and+Valverde%2C+eds.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fdd43c7e1ddbcb1c1523de0c67b16f59c9bddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,253,212,60,126,29,219,203,28,21,35,222,12,103,177,111,89,201,189,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
