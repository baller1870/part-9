Nicknamed &quot;The Prez,&quot; he was particularly known for his work with the Count Basie Band during the 1930s and 1940s and for his recordings with vocalist Billie Holiday.  ( He gave Holiday her nickname &quot;Lady Day.&quot;  ) Young's freewheeling style included holding the saxophone at odd angles; he often held it nearly horizontal.  His signature porkpie hat also was copied by generations of jazz musicians.  Young and his contemporary Coleman Hawkins are often listed as the original twin towers of modern jazz saxophone.  Young was drafted into the U. S.  Army in 1944, but court-martialed for marijuana use and discharged the next year.&quot;\n\nWow! A really good overview of Prez. For anyone first investigating this sax great I couldn't think of anyplace better to get started. \nI discovered Lester Young by way of reading John Harvey an English mystery writer whose main character is a jazz afficianado. I think it's a great way to expose yourself to new things by paying attention to the favorites of people you admire. ~ John P.
