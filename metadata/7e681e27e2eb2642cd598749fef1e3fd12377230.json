The book focuses on the moral nature of laissez-faire capitalism and private property. The book has a very specific definition of capitalism, a system it regards as broader than simply property rights or free enterprise. It was originally published in 1966.\n\nThis is the audio book version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e681e27e2eb2642cd598749fef1e3fd12377230","amp;dn":"Ayn+Rand+-+Capitalism+%3AThe+Unknown+Ideal+%5Baudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e681e27e2eb2642cd598749fef1e3fd12377230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,104,30,39,226,235,38,66,205,89,135,73,254,241,227,253,18,55,114,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
