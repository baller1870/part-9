He is often described as the father of tragedy.  Our knowledge of the genre begins with his work and our understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays.\n\nOnly seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived into modern times, and there is a longstanding debate about his authorship of one of these plays, PROMETHEUS BOUND.  Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotes and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian papyrus, often giving us surprising insights into his work.  He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy; his ORESTEIA is the only ancient example of the form to have survived.\n\nAt least one of his works was influenced by the Persian invasion of Greece, which took place during his lifetime.  THE PERSIANS is the only extant classical Greek tragedy concerned with recent history and it is a useful source of information about that period.  So important was the war to Aeschylus and the Greeks that, upon his death, his epitaph commemorated his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon rather than his success as a playwright.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* AGAMEMNON (Orange Street Press Classics, 1998).
