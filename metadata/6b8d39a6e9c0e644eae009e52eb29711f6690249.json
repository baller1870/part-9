Its job is straightforwardÃ¢â‚¬â€to protect us from cancer. This geneÃ¢â‚¬â€known simply as p53Ã¢â‚¬â€constantly scans our cells to ensure that they grow and divide without mishap, as part of the routine maintenance of our bodies. If a cell makes a mistake in copying its DNA as part of its process of division, p53 stops it in its tracks, sending in the repair team before allowing the cell to carry on dividing. If the mistake is irreparable and the rogue cell threatens to grow out of control (as happens in cancer), p53 commands the cell to commit suicide. Cancer cannot develop unless p53 itself is damaged and malfunctioning. Not surprisingly, p53 is the most studied gene in history.\n\nThis enormously important gene has teased the minds of some of the most colourful and ambitious scientists around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b8d39a6e9c0e644eae009e52eb29711f6690249","amp;dn":"P53+-+The+Gene+That+Cracked+The+Cancer+Code+-+Sue+Armstrong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b8d39a6e9c0e644eae009e52eb29711f6690249","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,141,57,166,233,192,230,68,234,224,9,229,46,178,151,17,246,105,2,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
