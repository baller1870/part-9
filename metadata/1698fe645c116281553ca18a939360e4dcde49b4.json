The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\nIn the meantime, they developed a prototype for power ballads with &quot;Dream On,&quot; a piano ballad that was orchestrated with strings and distorted guitars. Aerosmith's ability to pull off both ballads and rock &amp; roll made them extremely popular during the mid-'70s, when they had a string of gold and platinum albums. By the early '80s, the group's audience had declined as the band fell prey to drug and alcohol abuse. However, their career was far from over -- in the late '80s, Aerosmith pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in rock history, returning to the top of the charts with a group of albums that equalled, if not surpassed, the popularity of their '70s albums.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\n01.Draw The Line\n02.I Wanna Know Why\n03.Critical Mass\n04.Get It Up\n05.Bright Light Fright\n06.Kings And Queens\n07.The Hand That Feeds\n08.Sight For Sore Eyes\n09.Milk Cow Blues\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1698fe645c116281553ca18a939360e4dcde49b4","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Draw+The+Line+%2ARemaster%2A+%281977%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1698fe645c116281553ca18a939360e4dcde49b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,152,254,100,92,17,98,129,85,60,161,138,147,147,96,228,220,222,73,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
