The band have delivered a unique sound by playing lengthy songs built on heavily repeated riffs with droning vocals and a large use of effects and sound manipulation. The bands music is based largely over long sludgy riffs reminiscent of Electric Wizard and a heavy use of psychedelic effects.\n\nUfomammut released their first album, Godlike Snake under Beard of Stars Records in 2000. This was followed in 2004 by the release of Snailking, their second full length release. Snailking has since been reissued by Supernatural Cat Records in 2009. In 2007 the band recorded Supernaturals: Record One with Lento. Ufomammut's fourth album, Idolum was released in 2008.\n\nIn 2010 the band released Eve, the fifth album. Eve - consisting of one 45-minute atmospheric track, divided into five distinctive movements Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acts as a living homage to the first woman on Earth, and the rebellion to her creator for bringing knowledge to Mankind. Eve is a new step in the sonic adventure of Ufomammut. Rounding out at 44:44, the album offers a similarly long and atmospheric experience as Idolum, layered with sludgy heavy riffing and yet also bearing some of the calmer, more reflective passages the band displayed on their Lucifer Songs LP; Eve, as well as Idolum showcases the bands signature sound.\nimage\nORO is Ufomammut's latest work, divided into ten powerful movements overall which has now been confirmed to be delivered in two separate pieces during 2012: the first chapter, Opus Primum, in April, and the second, Opus Alter, in September.\nAs with all previous Ufomammut albums, the concepts behind ORO are expansive and multi-faceted, mutating the Italian palindrome which translates to Ã¢â‚¬Å“goldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with the Latin translation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“I pray.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nUrlo - Bass, Keyboards, Vocals\nPoia - Guitars, Keyboards\nVita - Drums\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\n2000 Godlike Snake\n2004 Snailking\n2005 Lucifer Songs\n2007 Supernaturals Record One\n2008 Idolum\n2010 Eve\n2012 Oro: Opus Primum\n2012 Oro: Opus Alter\n\n\n\nXV: Magickal Mastery (2014) (Live)\n\n\n\n01.
