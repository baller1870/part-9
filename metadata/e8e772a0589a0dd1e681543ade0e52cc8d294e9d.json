The show was written by John Sullivan, who later wrote Only Fools and Horses. The pilot was transmitted on 12 April 1977 in the Comedy Special series of one-off plays, and the series proper ran from 3 November 1977 to 31 December 1980.\n\nCitizen Smith starred Robert Lindsay as &quot;Wolfie&quot; Smith, a young Communist &quot;urban guerrilla&quot; living in Tooting, South London, who is attempting to emulate his hero Che Guevara. Wolfie is the self-proclaimed leader of the revolutionary Tooting Popular Front (the TPF, merely a small bunch of his friends), the goals of which are &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;Freedom for Tooting&quot;. In reality, he is an unemployed dreamer and petty criminal whose plans fall through because of laziness and disorganisation.\n\nThe quality of the DVDs are not great but still very watchable.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e772a0589a0dd1e681543ade0e52cc8d294e9d","amp;dn":"Citizen+Smith++%28BBC+-+Seasons+1-2+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e772a0589a0dd1e681543ade0e52cc8d294e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,231,114,160,88,154,13,209,230,129,84,58,222,14,82,204,141,41,78,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
