(32 kbps / 22 kHz Mono Fraunhofer CBR MP3).\n\n\n\nNear the end of the 20th century, for reasons beyond the grasp of modern science, human sperm count went to zero. It is now 2021, but the last birth occurred in 1995, and in the space of a generation humanity has lost its future. In England, under the rule of an increasingly despotic Warden, the infirm are encouraged to commit group suicide, criminals are exiled and abandoned and immigrants are subjected to semi-legalized slavery. Divorced, middle-aged Oxford history professor Theo Faron, an emotionally constrained man of means and intelligence who is the Warden's cousin, plods through an ordered, bleak existence. But a chance involvement with a group of dissidents moves him onto unexpected paths, leading him, in the novel's compelling second half, toward risk, commitment and the joys and anguish of love. In this convincingly detailed world--where kittens are (illegally) christened, sex has lost its allure and the arts have been abandoned--James concretely explores an unthinkable prospect. Readers should persevere through the somewhat slow start, for the rewards of this story, including its reminder of the transforming power of hope, are many and lasting....\n\nAlthough P.D.James never truly attempted to break away from the crime genre, this 1992 dystopian novel, was adapted in 2006 by Alfonso CuarÃƒÂ³n and starred Clive Owen and Julianne Moore. It garnered three Oscar nominations, including one for Best Adapted Screenplay. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57db96000f1bd2f03c7417ec5dca1380ad49d9d1","amp;dn":"The+Children+of+Men+-+P.D.+James++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57db96000f1bd2f03c7417ec5dca1380ad49d9d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,219,150,0,15,27,210,240,60,116,23,236,93,202,19,128,173,73,217,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
