If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe the world of software affects the world in which you live, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œLenny Zeltzer, SANS Institute faculty member and the New York Security Consulting Manager at Savvis, Inc.\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Geekonomics stays with you long after you finish reading the book. You will reconsider every assumption you have had about software costs and benefits.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œSlava Frid, Gemini Systems, CTO, Resilience Technology Solutions\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Information Security is an issue that concerns governments, companies and, increasingly, citizens. Are the computer systems and software to which we entrust our sensitive and critical information, technologies that are out of control? David Rice has written an important and welcome book that goes to the heart of this issue, and points to solutions that society as a whole needs to debate and embrace.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œNick Bleech, IT Security Director, Rolls-Royce\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you are dependent upon software (and of course, all of us in the modern world are) this book is a fabulous discussion of how and why we should worry.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œBecky Bace\n\n \n\nThe Real Cost of Insecure Software\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 1996, software defects in a Boeing 757 caused a crash that killed 70 peopleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 2003, a software vulnerability helped cause the largest U.S. power outage in decadesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 2004, known software weaknesses let a hacker invade T-Mobile, capturing everything from passwords to Paris HiltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photosÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 2005, 23,900 Toyota Priuses were recalled for software errors that could cause the cars to shut down at highway speedsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 2006 dubbed Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Year of Cybercrime,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 7,000 software vulnerabilities were discovered that hackers could use to access private informationÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In 2007, operatives in two nations brazenly exploited software vulnerabilities to cripple the infrastructure and steal trade secrets from other sovereign nationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSoftware has become crucial to the very survival of civilization. But badly written, insecure software is hurting peopleÃ¢â‚¬â€œand costing businesses and individuals billions of dollars every year. This must change. In Geekonomics, David Rice shows how we can change it.\n\n \n\nRice reveals why the software industry is rewarded for carelessness, and how we can revamp the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incentives to get the reliability and security we desperately need and deserve. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover why the software industry still has shockingly little accountabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€œand what we must do to fix that.\n\nBrilliantly written, utterly compelling, and thoroughly realistic, Geekonomics is a long-overdue call to arms. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re software user, decision maker, employee, or business owner this book will change your lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦or even save it.\n\n \n\nThe Alarming Cost of Insecure, Badly Written Software...\n\nand How to Finally Fix the Problem, Once and for All!\n\n \n\nSix billion crash test dummies: why youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at greater risk than you ever imagined.\n\nYou pay the price: why consumers are legally and financially responsible for the mistakes of software manufacturers.\n\nBroken windows: how software promotes epidemic cyber crime and threatens national security.\n\nWho runs the show?: Why software manufacturers fought against the U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attempts to protect the U.S. blood supply.\n\nProtecting national infrastructure: real incentives for transforming software manufacturing.\n\nSurviving the information superhighway: practical, must-read advice in a world of insecure code.\n\n \n\nPreface xiii\n\nAcknowledgments xix\n\nAbout the Author xx\n\n \n\nChapter 1: The Foundation of Civilization 1\n\nChapter 2: Six Billion Crash Test Dummies: Irrational Innovation and Perverse Incentives 19\n\nChapter 3: The Power of Weaknesses: Broken Windows and National Security 73\n\nChapter 4: Myopic Oversight: Blinded by Speed, Baffled by Churn 131\n\nChapter 5: Absolute Immunity: You CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Sue Us Even If You Wanted To 179\n\nChapter 6: Open Source Software: Free, But at What Cost? 243\n\nChapter 7: Moving Forward: Rational Incentives for a Different Future 273\n\n \n\nEpilogue 321\n\nNotes 325\n\nIndex 341\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDavid Rice is an internationally recognized information security professional and an accomplished educator and visionary.
