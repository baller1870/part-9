The Operation was basically a list of names of people who were thought to be harmful to the government, or dangerously subversive and were being watched. If this is true then it's an amazing coincidence so many of the people on this list died in mysterious circumstances towards the end of the 60's.\n\nThe author from what I can ascertain is another of the crew that alleges The CIA uses Satanic cults and mind control to programme people to commit certain acts. A theory I find a little far fetched I must say. Though my knowledge of psychology tells me that &quot;mind control&quot; is indeed possible though highly unethical, I just don't know why these authors always have to ruin their claims by saying crazy stuff about Satanic rituals.\n\nI also noticed a mistake in the chapter about Hendrix, he says Monica Danneman phoned Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eric BridgesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to inform him Jimi was ill. It's pretty well documented that it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eric BurdonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the famous band Ã¢â‚¬Å“The AnimalsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she phoned. Only a slight mistake, but if he managed to get a famous persons name wrong how many more mistakes are there in this book?\n\nThere are however a lot of claims made that are chillingly believable, though in my opinion there isn't really enough evidence to back it all up. The quotes are mainly taken from the press and interviews with people published in the press (and we all no what bull the media is capable of peddling). The sources for the most disturbing pieces of information are usually anonymous so it's hard to see where he actually got his evidence from. But one could argue that if there really is a massive cover up going on and people are being killed then witnesses would want to talk anonymously!\n\nThis book is worth reading if you are interested in the lives and untimely deaths of Rock stars in the 60's, or covert CIA operations from that period, or both! It is well written and where possible sources are given. It paints a very sad picture of what was actually going on in the 60's and raises a lot of questions about peoples untimely deaths. I hope one day books like this will help pressurise the authorities into actually finding out what really happened to guys like Jimi Hendrix and Brian Jones. Who were after all not only Rock stars but just 27 year old men with bright futures who did not deserve to die in the violent ways books like this suggest they did.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6ce0ddf16395fc4cd4719b859ad0afddea37ee","amp;dn":"The+Covert+War+Against+Rock%3A+What+You+Don%27t+Know+About+the+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6ce0ddf16395fc4cd4719b859ad0afddea37ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,108,224,221,241,99,149,252,76,212,113,155,133,154,208,175,221,234,55,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
