However, current systems engineering textbooks are either too technical or at a high conceptual level. Written by an expert with more than ten years of teaching experience, Systems Engineering: Design Principles and Models not only gives students exposure to the concepts of systems and systems engineering, but also provides enough technical expertise for them to immediately use and apply what they learn.\r\n\r\nThe book covers systems and systems engineering, systems methods, models, and analytical techniques as well as systems management and control methods. It discusses systems concepts, emphasizing system life cycle, and includes coverage of systems design processes and the major activities involved. It offers hands-on exercises after each chapter, giving students a solid understanding of system requirements, and uses a software package (CORE) to introduce the requirement management process.\r\n\r\nDesigned for readers with a wide range of backgrounds, the book enables students to learn about systems and systems engineering, and, more specifically, to be able to use and apply the models and methods in the systems engineering field. The author has integrated feedback from students with materials used in teaching for many years, making the book especially approachable to non-engineering students with no prior exposure to this subject. Engineering students, on the other hand, will also benefit from the clear, concise coverage this book provides as well as the relevant analysis models and techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a18fe2bdb57323d0b8f66d2e7d2b3d420c99a7a","amp;dn":"Systems+Engineering%3A+Design+Principles+and+Models+%5B2016%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a18fe2bdb57323d0b8f66d2e7d2b3d420c99a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,24,254,43,219,87,50,61,11,143,102,210,231,210,179,212,32,201,154,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
