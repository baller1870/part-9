He co-produced and performed on Jimmie Dale Gilmore's 2000 album Endless Night. He has also appeared on several albums by songwriter and singer Lucinda Williams.\n\nIn 2004, Miller toured with Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin, Gillian Welch, and David Rawlings as the Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue.\n\nAt the 4th Annual Americana Music Association Honors &amp; Awards, the Ryman Auditorium September 2005, Miller received the Album of the Year Award for Universal United House of Prayer, and the opening cut of that album, &quot;Worry Too Much&quot; (penned by Mark Heard, and originally released on his Second Hand album), won the Song of the Year Award.\n\nBuddy Miller has also produced albums for a number of artists. During 2006 Solomon Burke came over to Miller's house at Nashville to record his country album 'Nashville' on which Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin, Gillian Welch and Dolly Parton appear as duet partners.\n\nHe has a signature acoustic guitar made by the Fender company, and frequently uses vintage Wandre electric guitars.\n\nBuddy Miller toured as part of the band on Robert Plant and Alison Krauss's Raising Sand tour of the USA and Europe, and with Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin and Shawn Colvin on the Three Girls and Their Buddy tour. While on tour, Miller suffered a heart attack in Baltimore on February 19, 2009 following his performance as part of the MammoJam Music Festival and underwent triple bypass surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital on 20 February.[1]\n\nAt the annual Americana Music Association Honors and Awards program at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee on September 18, 2008, Miller received the &quot;AMA Instrumentalist Of The Year&quot; award, which was presented to him by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss.

She married Buddy Miller in 1981. They sing and play on each other's solo projects and have recorded a duets album on HighTone Records.\n\nMiller's first recording was on the mini LP album Streetlight, which consisted of Julie, Buddy and Ron Krueger. Julie and Buddy provided some songwriting to the LP, which included the original version of &quot;Jesus in Your Eyes&quot; (later re-recorded for Orphans and Angels). &quot;How Could You Say No&quot; (written by Mickey Cates) was also originally performed on this album, and later included in Julie's solo debut Meet Julie Miller.\n\nAn 8 track 1985 demo from Miller included 2 songs that were later included on Meet Julie Miller, but the remaining 6 songs were not re-recorded. The songs on this tape are: &quot;I Don't Need Anything Else&quot;, &quot;Mystery Love&quot; (Synth Pop Version), &quot;Love Is&quot;, &quot;I Look to You&quot;, &quot;I Don't Need&quot;, &quot;What Does it Take&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Ready&quot;, &quot;King of my Heart&quot; (not the same as that which appeared later on her first Myrrh release), &quot;My New Psychiatrist&quot; (Synth Pop Version with different lyrics), &quot;Debby Came Back&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Place&quot; (Synth Pop Version).\n\nIn 1987 Julie contributed background vocals to the song &quot;Remember Me&quot; on Benny Hester's album Through the Window.\n\nMiller's musical career initially took off after singer Sam Phillips discovered a demo tape by the artist and turned it over to friends at Myrrh Records. Miller was signed to a contract and recorded her first solo album, Meet Julie Miller for the label, released in 1990. This album included backing vocals from Shawn Colvin, Victoria Williams, Amy Grant, Kelly Willard and Russ Taff.\n\nMiller's second solo album, He Walks Through Walls (1991) also included backing vocals from Colvin, Williams, Grant and Willard as with her debut. Mark Heard and Reverend Dan Smith also contributed vocals.

Julie mentioned after a 2002 concert in Kentucky that the song &quot;Emily's Eyes&quot; had one line edited out of it, as there was concern regarding the &quot;implications&quot;. No further details were given explaining.\n\nMiller's 1993 album Orphans and Angels included a duet with Emmylou Harris on the song &quot;All My Tears&quot;, which has become one of Miller's most popular songs. Jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott also contributed vocals. The song was written after the death of Mark Heard. Miller also covered Heard's song &quot;Treasure of the Broken Land&quot;. Shawn Colvin once again contributed background vocals.\n\nMiller's 4th solo album was released by Street Level Records, a departure from Word Records which released her first 3 solo albums.
