Please read the installation instructions before commencing with the installation of Honda Marine v4.00.\n\nThe outboard workshop service manuals are for Honda models: BF20, BF2, BF50, B75, B75K1, B75K2, B75K3, BF8, BF100, BF9.9, BF15, BF20, BF35, BF45, BF2, BF5, BF8D, BF10D, BF15D, BF29D, BF25D, BF30D, BF40, BF50, BF75, BF90, BF115, BF130, BF135, BF150, BF175, BF200 and BF225.\t\n\nI've tried ripping the above manuals individually from the CD-ROM but the PDF's are protected by encryption and I've tried every PDF decryption tool available but each tool has failed to decrypt and read Honda's secured PDF's :( so you'll have to download the complete library. You don't need to burn the files to a CD-ROM to install the manuals, just run the &quot;install manuals&quot; application inside the service manuals folder.\n\nIf anyone is able to decrypt Honda's Workshop service manuals and upload them as individual unprotected PDF's that would be cool. PDF's are encrypted by Honda using Seal v1.01 160 bit Encryption. Plz seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e33ab7a492a6ba20505fffaf2b1ac6e83996539","amp;dn":"Honda+Outboard+Service+Manuals+1984-2004+CD-ROM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e33ab7a492a6ba20505fffaf2b1ac6e83996539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,51,171,122,73,42,107,162,5,5,255,250,242,177,172,110,131,153,101,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
