The band enjoyed some chart success, including the UK and Canadian hits &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) and &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot; (1982), but are perhaps better known for their long-standing critical (rather than commercial) success. \n\n\n\n\nFossil Fuel The XTC Singles 1977 - 1992 1996\n\n\nFossil Fuel: The XTC Singles 1977Ã¢â‚¬â€œ92 is a compilation album by XTC released in 1996. It was their third such Greatest Hits album following 1982's Waxworks: Some Singles 1977-1982 and 1987's The Compact XTC. It collects all thirty-one of their Virgin Records UK singles in chronological order. It does not include their pseudonymous singles as The Dukes of Stratosphear, The Three Wise Men or The Colonel.\n\nThe two discs reflect their shift in popularity from Great Britain to the United States in the mid-eighties. Some of Disc 1's tracks (&quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot;, &quot;Senses Working Overtime&quot;) were Top 40 hits in their homeland while a handful of songs from Disc 2 became popular on stateside college radio (&quot;Dear God&quot;, &quot;The Mayor of Simpleton&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead&quot;).\n\nWith no little significance, the compilation closes out with &quot;Wrapped in Grey&quot;, which had been released as the third single from 1992's Nonsuch and then quickly recalled and deleted by Virgin Records, an event which effectively ended XTC's association with the label.\n\nIt reached No. 33 on the UK album charts.\n\n[b]Tracks: [/b]\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Science Friction&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n2.\t&quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:52\n3.\t&quot;This is Pop?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n4.\t&quot;Are You Receiving Me?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:04\n5.\t&quot;Life Begins at the Hop&quot; (Colin Moulding) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:47\n6.\t&quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (Moulding) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n7.\t&quot;Ten Feet Tall&quot; (Moulding) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n8.\t&quot;Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n9.\t&quot;Generals and Majors&quot; (Moulding) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41\n10.\t&quot;Towers of London&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:38\n11.\t&quot;Sgt.
