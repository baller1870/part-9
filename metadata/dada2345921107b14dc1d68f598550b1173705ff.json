The album and project was birthed after two years of intensive work on his third album and his first collection of classical compositions, Romantic Works, which was surprise-released on the same day of Hensonâ€™s headlining show at Londonâ€™s Queen Elizabeth Hallâ€”at the request of James Lavelle. Emotionally exhausted, Henson retreated inside, both physically and emotionally, and crafted nine superbly written, improvised cuts that would form Behaving. Intricate, loose, and delicate rhythms sit snuggly underneath Henson's crooning vocals and gorgeous piano work, all melding together to create a stunning collection not to far removed from the work of James Blake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dada2345921107b14dc1d68f598550b1173705ff","amp;dn":"Keaton+Henson+-+Behaving+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dada2345921107b14dc1d68f598550b1173705ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,218,35,69,146,17,7,177,77,193,214,143,89,133,80,177,23,55,5,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
