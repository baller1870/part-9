In addition, the concepts always involve invisible electric and magnetic fields which are hard to visualize for most students.\r\n\r\nThis DVD course begins by explaining every topic in great detail using a variety of illustrations and practical examples.  The core topics are all taught by working fully worked example problems which help the student review for exams and build homework problem solving skills.\r\n\r\nEvery problem is fully worked with no steps skipped.  The easiest way to learn physics is to learn-by-doing, and this is what this DVD set provides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics Covered;\r\n\r\nSection 1: The Capacitor\r\nSection 2: Capacitor Problems\r\nSection 3: Capacitors in Circuits, Part 1\r\nSection 4: Capacitors in Circuits, Part 2\r\nSection 5: Energy Storage in a Capacitor\r\nSection 6: Capacitors with a Dielectric, Part 1\r\nSection 7: Capacitors with a Dielectric, Part 2\r\nSection 8: Electric Current and Current Density, Part 1\r\nSection 9: Electric Current and Current Density, Part 2\r\nSection 10: The Magnetic Field\r\nSection 11: Magnetic Force on a Charged Particle, Part 1\r\nSection 12: Magnetic Force on a Charged Particle, Part 2\r\nSection 13: Equations of an Orbiting Charge in a Magnetic Field\r\nSection 14: Magnetic Confinement and the Earth's Aurora\r\nSection 15: Orbiting Charges in a Magnetic Field\r\nSection 16: Magnetic Force on a Current Carrying Wire, Part 1\r\nSection 17: Magnetic Force on a Current Carrying Wire, Part 2\r\nSection 18: Magnetic Force on a Current Carrying Wire, Part 3\r\nSection 19: Magnetic Torque on a Current Loop (Electric Motors)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d796da79b70396408b32cfe96fb3cd16f8a7d64","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Physics+Tutor+Course+3.2+-+Electricity+%26amp%3B+Magnetism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d796da79b70396408b32cfe96fb3cd16f8a7d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,121,109,167,155,112,57,100,8,179,44,254,150,251,60,209,111,138,125,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
