The techniques described are fundamental to the collection, storage and presentation of geological data and their use to locate ore. This book explains the various tasks which the exploration geologist is asked to perform in the sequence in which they might be employed in an actual exploration project. Hints and tips are give. The steps are illustrated with numerous examples drawn from real projects on which the author has worked. The book emphasizes traditional skills and shows how they can be combined effectively with modern technological approaches. \n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 253 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 2nd edition (June 15, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3540743707\n# ISBN-13: 978-3540743705","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4025349af6a9c030a789a57000918f9ad4348c2d","amp;dn":"Geological+Methods+in+Mineral+Exploration+and+Mining%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4025349af6a9c030a789a57000918f9ad4348c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,37,52,154,246,169,192,48,167,137,165,112,0,145,143,154,212,52,140,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
