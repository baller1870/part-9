However, the 11-minute epic &quot;Brownsville Girl&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€co-written by Sam ShepardÃ¢â‚¬â€has been cited as one of his best by some critics.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;You Wanna Ramble&quot; (Little Junior Parker) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n    &quot;They Killed Him&quot; (Kris Kristofferson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n    &quot;Driftin' Too Far from Shore&quot; (Bob Dylan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n    &quot;Precious Memories&quot; (Trad.
