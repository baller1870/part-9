He is widely considered to be Israel's most famous living writer and is frequently considered to be a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nOz's work has been published in more than forty languages, including Arabic, and he has received many honours and awards, among them the Legion of Honour of France, the Goethe Prize, the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature, the Heinrich Heine Prize and the Israel Prize.  Since 1967, he has been a prominent advocate and major cultural voice of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and regularly publishes essays on the subjects of politics, literature, and peace.\n\nHis first book, WHERE THE JACKALS HOWL (1965), is a disturbing and moving collection of short stories about kibbutz life.  A PERFECT PEACE (1982), set in the eighteen months leading up to the Six-Day War, portrays life on a fictional kibbutz, Granot, where the founding generation and their children struggle to come to terms with each other and the ideological tensions within Israeli society.  In BETWEEN FRIENDS (2013), Oz returns to the kibbutz of the late 1950s, the time and place where his writing began. These eight interconnected stories, set in the fictitious Kibbutz Yekhat, draw masterly profiles of idealistic men and women enduring personal hardships in the shadow of one of the greatest collective dreams of the twentieth century.\n\nMY MICHAEL (1968) is a haunting love story and a rich, reflective portrait of Jerusalem in the 1950s.  FIMA (1994), also set in Jerusalem, portrays a man, and a generation, dreaming noble dreams but doing nothing.  SCENES FROM VILLAGE LIFE (2011) is a memorable novel-in-stories that offers a brilliant, unsettling glimpse of what goes on beneath the surface of everyday life.\n\nFinally, there are several nonfiction works in this collection.  IN THE LAND OF ISRAEL (1983) records Oz's observations and reflections as, notebook in hand, he traveled throughout Israel and the West Bank to talk with workers, soldiers, religious zealots, aging pioneers, new immigrants, desperate Arabs, and visionaries, asking them questions about IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, present, and future.  The essays in THE SLOPES OF LEBANON (1989) offer Oz's views on Israel's offensive into Lebanon in 1982; fanaticism of all stripes; the PLO; Israeli terrorism; the new militarism and the growing intolerance toward the Arab population in Israel; Jewish attitudes toward the Holocaust, and its misappropriation by the right and left alike; Claude LanzmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film Shoah; the dream of Zionism and its failures; and much more.\n\nThe essays in UNDER THIS BLAZING LIGHT (1995) include an examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a dispute between &quot;Right and Right&quot;; a look at the meaning of socialism in the Israeli context; reflections on the concept of &quot;Homeland&quot; and on the nature of the kibbutz; and reflections on the character of Zionism.  A TALE OF LOVE AND DARKNESS (2004) is Oz's acclaimed memoir of coming of age in the midst of Israel's turbulent birth pangs, his mother's tragic suicide, and his decision to change his name and join a kibbutz.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of PDF and ePUB formats as indicated:\n\n\n                             == Novels &amp; Short Stories ==\n\n* BETWEEN FRIENDS (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013).
