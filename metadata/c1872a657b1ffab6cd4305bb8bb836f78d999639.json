Part I\nThe Eye in the Pyramid\n\nPerformed by: Ken Campbell\n&amp; Chris Fairbank\nAudio Length: 13 hours\nCategory: Unabridged Fiction\nFormat: 32kbps MP3 \n\n\\&quot;It was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton.\\&quot; And so begins the original and genuine trilogy of conspiracies, Illuminatus!. For the first time in audiobook form, Deepleaf Audio presents the unabridged Trilogy in all its grandeur, spookiness, hilarity and brilliance.\n\nPart I - The Eye in the Pyramid was performed by the incomparable Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbank, and broadcast live in London on ResonanceFM in June 2006. In 1976, Ken Campbell adapted Illuminatus! for the stage - a 10 hour epic which went on to open the Royal National Theatre in London under the patronage of Her Majesty Elizabeth II. Chris Fairbank played Simon Moon, among other characters, in the Campbell production which included Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, David Rappoport and Bill Drummond. 30 years and 23 Fernando Poos since Ken and Chris first breathed life into Shea and Wilson\\'s masterpiece and Illuminatus! seems even more startlingly relevant and chock full of laughter than ever before.
