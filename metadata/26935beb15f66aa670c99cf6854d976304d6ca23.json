It sounded like maybe a comic recording until noticing that she was hitting all the notes exactly as she wanted.  The wistful passion in her song is the kind you wish someone was singing to you.  I bought the CD and have become a real fan.  This CD seems like the best place to start.  It was the beginning of her career and she had terrific backup - including Ray Brown on Bass.  She makes fun of guys who hit on her in the Paris clubs where she was discovered, but in this selection of songs you can hear why they did.  ~ D.  Ziesmer &quot;vagabond&quot;\n\n&quot;They Say It's Spring. &quot; &quot;Let Me Love You. &quot; &quot;The Party's Over. &quot; &quot;I Won't Dance. &quot; No matter what she sings, Blossom Dearie does just that.  She blossoms.  O. K.  lots of people have never heard of her.  I'm one of the lucky ones.  Since I was three or four, I can remember hearing Blossom's radiant voice on my parent's stereo0.  I also had the pleasure of seeing her live in concert three years ago in New York. \nWhat's amazing (live or on CD) is that she sounds no different today than she did back in 1956.  That's quite an accomplishment, but it's true. \nThis CD - 16 songs in all - is the perfect intro to this national treasure.  Even better, she does her own thing with each and every one of the songs that come her way including her daft rendition of &quot;The Surrey With the Fringe on Top. &quot; If you should add this CD to your collection, upon the first spin you'll be hooked.  Go Blossom.  ~ James V.
