That's not really fair, since he's actually an imaginative, unpredictable guitarist. Granted, his albums can sound a little sterile, but that criticism can be applied to most contemporary blues albums. The main problem with his records is that they're interchangeable -- all of them sound similar and all of them are about as strong as their predecessor. Baby Wants to Boogie isn't particularly different from his other albums, but it does have some good songs and solos, making it as good a place to learn about Theessink as any.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34c7b137e8d35974e9953495e82eeac02d6018f3","amp;dn":"Hans+Theessink+-+Baby+Wants+to+Boogie+%5B1988%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34c7b137e8d35974e9953495e82eeac02d6018f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,199,177,55,232,211,89,116,233,149,52,149,232,46,234,192,45,96,24,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
