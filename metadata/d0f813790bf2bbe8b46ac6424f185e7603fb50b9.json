The potential consequences are incalculable and journalist Julie takes up the battle through a debate with those responsible. But Rasmus, a geophycisist who has just returned from the Arctic, feels a need to resort to extreme methods. Equipped with a gun, he not only takes the government hostage, but the whole of Copenhagen as well. His demand is that the drilling must stop or he will start killing people.
