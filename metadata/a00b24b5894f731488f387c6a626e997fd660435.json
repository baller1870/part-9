The brainchild of radio announcer Don Cornelius, the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s producer and host, Soul Train featured a diverse range of stars, from James Brown and David Bowie to Christine Aguilera and R. Kelly; Marvin Gaye and Elton John to the New Kids on the Block and Stevie Wonder.\n\nThe Hippest Trip in America tells the full story of this pop culture phenomenon that appealed not only to blacks, but to a wide crossover audience as well. Famous dancers like Rosie Perez and Jody Watley, performers such as Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and Barry White, and Cornelius himself share their memories, offering insights into the show and its timeÃ¢â‚¬â€a period of extraordinary social and political change. Colorful and pulsating, The Hippest Trip In America is a fascinating portrait of a revered cultural institution that has left an indelible mark on our national consciousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00b24b5894f731488f387c6a626e997fd660435","amp;dn":"The+Hippest+Trip+in+America-+Soul+Train+and+the+Evolution+of+Cul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00b24b5894f731488f387c6a626e997fd660435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,11,36,181,137,79,115,20,136,243,135,198,166,38,233,151,253,102,4,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
