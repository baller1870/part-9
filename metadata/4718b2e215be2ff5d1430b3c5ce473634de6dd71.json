Forster\nThe New Collected Short Stories\nSidgwick &amp; Jackson, 1985\nFormats: epub &amp; mobi\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â \nForster's short stories are amusing, profound, lighthearted, mysterious, wise and witty. He was a master of the art. This new collection of his stories is the most comprehensive collection available. Besides the classic anthologies originally published as The Celestial Omnibus and The Eternal Moment, it includes the three most important stories published after Forster's death: Ã¢â‚¬ËœDr WoolacottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Life to ComeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Other BoatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThese fantasies . . .Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ said E.M. Forster in his introduction to the first edition of Collected Short Stories in 1947, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ. . . represent all that I have accomplished in a particular line.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ This was true in its way, but there was a parallel, hidden line of fiction-writing, on the theme of homosexual love, which Forster kept private during his lifetime, showing his work only to selected friends. T.E. Lawrence, for instance, wrote to Forster that Ã¢â‚¬ËœDr WoolacottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmost powerful thing I ever read . . . more charged with the real high explosive than anything I've ever met yet.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nP.N. Furbank, Reader in Literature at the Open University and author of E.M. Forster: A Life, has written a valuable introduction to this new edition which evaluates the short stories in the context of Forster's life and his other writing.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPublishing history of the stories 6\nIntroduction to the new collection by P.N.
