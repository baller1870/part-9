That means from the muscle and its contraction to the control of metabolic fuels, and from renal filtration to the control of breathing, you have everything you need on physiology in one place. But don't just take our word for it...look inside and make the most of Physiology at a Glance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:865f5e870a8a5f36a5e633bc2977452e5845fb9f","amp;dn":"Physiology+at+a+Glance+%283rd+Ed.%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"865f5e870a8a5f36a5e633bc2977452e5845fb9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,95,94,135,10,138,95,54,165,230,51,188,41,119,69,46,88,69,251,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
