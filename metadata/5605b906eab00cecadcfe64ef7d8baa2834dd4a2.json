She has, after all, had the most successful career outside of The Mac.\n          This box set spans her entire solo career in formidable fashion, and included is a   \n          lavish booklet with extensive liner notes and many never-before-seen photos. Aside   \n          from her solo career, the Mac gem &quot;Rhiannon&quot; (piano version) is included, along with \n          &quot;Gold&quot; (with John Stewart), &quot;Whenever I Call You Friend&quot; (with Kenny Loggins), and   \n          &quot;Long Distance Winner&quot; (with Lindsey Buckingham). As for her solo work, hits from    \n          &quot;Bella Donna&quot; to &quot;Street Angel&quot; are here, as well as B-sides, soundtrack cuts, and   \n          demos. &quot;Reconsider Me&quot; (with Don Henley) is a fine ballad that compares with Stevie&amp;#039;s\n          best work. This is a comprehensive package that shows us just how much wonderful     \n          music has been created outside of Stevie Nick&amp;#039;s Fleetwood Mac tenure.                \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                    Cd1                                                                        \n                                                                                               \n                 01.Enchanted                   [03:06]                                        \n                 02.Outside the rain            [04:18]                                        \n                 03.After the glitter fades     [03:30]                                        \n                 04.Wild heart                  [06:10]                                        \n                 05.Leather and lace            [03:57]                                        \n                    (w don henley)                                                             \n                 06.Garbo (b side)              [03:31]                                        \n                 07.Stand back                  [04:51]                                        \n                 08.Nightbird                   [05:00]                                        \n                 09.Stop draggin&amp;#039;
