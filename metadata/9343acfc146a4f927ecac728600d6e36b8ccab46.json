Originally the solo project of singer/songwriter Dan Smith, Bastille expanded to a quartet after he decided to form a band and got some of his friends involved. The band attracted a lot of attention after putting a few tracks online, leading to support slots at major U.K. festivals like Glastonbury and the Isle of Wight.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9343acfc146a4f927ecac728600d6e36b8ccab46","amp;dn":"Bastille+-+Bad+Blood+%28The+Extended+Cut+iTunes+Version%29+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9343acfc146a4f927ecac728600d6e36b8ccab46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,67,172,252,20,106,79,146,126,202,199,40,96,13,110,54,184,204,171,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
