First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left.[1] Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing;[1] and they disbanded early in 1986.[6] The band's status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.[7] Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c0f7b7e9c035ca55cdde584d17e254064ebbff","amp;dn":"Australian+Crawl%2FJames+Reyne+Collection+%5B2+Discs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c0f7b7e9c035ca55cdde584d17e254064ebbff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,192,247,183,233,192,53,202,85,205,222,88,77,23,226,84,6,78,187,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
