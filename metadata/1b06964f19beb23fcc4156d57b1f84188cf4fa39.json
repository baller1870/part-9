The film depicts a landing by the U.S. Marine Corps on an unnamed Japanese held Pacific island, however is thought to be Red Beach, Palo, Leyte in the Philippines. A reference to the recent Bougainville Campaign early in the film presumably dates the action to November 1943 or later. During World War II Allied amphibious operations, designated invasion beaches were code named by colour; such as Beach Red, Beach White, Beach Blue etc.\n\nThe film is based on a lengthy piece of prose, not quite a novel written by Peter Bowman based on his experiences with the US Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific Islands campaigns.\n\nCAST:-\nCornel Wilde\nRip Torn \nBurr DeBenning\nPatrick Wolfe \nJean Wallace\nJaime SÃƒÂ¡nchez \nDale Ishimoto\nGenki Koyama\n\nDirected by Cornel Wilde\nWritten by Peter Bowman\nRunning time 105 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Beach Red (1967)\nThe opening sequence of an opposed beach landing bears a stylistic resemblance to Saving Private Ryan, even though there is more than thirty years between the productions. In one scene during the landing a Marine is shown with his arm blown off similar to Tom Lea's painting The Price.\n\nAs Americans are shown consolidating their gains, flashbacks illustrate the lives of American and Japanese combatants. Shifting first person voice over in a stream of consciousness style is also used to portray thoughts of numerous characters. Like Wilde's previous production of The Naked Prey the film does not use subtitles for characters speaking Japanese.\n\nThe film contains large sections of voice over sections, often juxtaposed with still photographs of wives etc. (who inexplicably are dressed in 1967 attire rather than WW2). It contains a huge amount of crying by the troops, and an abnormal sympathy for the enemy. In one scene an injured marine is lying close to an injured Japanese soldier in a scene paralleling the famous scene in All Quiet On The Western Front just after they bond, other marines appear and kill the Japanese soldier causing distress to the first marine.\n\nDirector, producer, and co-writer Wilde plays a Marine Captain the company commander, Rip Torn plays his believable company gunnery sergeant who says the film's tagline &quot;That's what we're here for. To kill. The rest is all crap!&quot; .\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nFilmed on location in the Philippines using troops of the Philippine Armed Forces. The sequence of the Japanese dressed in Marine uniforms was inspired by the original book mentioning Japanese wearing American helmets to infiltrate American lines.\nWhen seeking assistance from the U.S. Marine Corps, Cornel Wilde was told that due to the commitments of the Vietnam War all the Corps could provide the film was color stock footage taken during the Pacific Island campaigns. The film provided had deteriorated so Wilde had to spend a considerable part of the film's budget to restore the film to an acceptable quality in order to blend into the film. The Marine Corps was grateful that their historical film had been restored at no cost to them.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 742 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.818:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 105 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b06964f19beb23fcc4156d57b1f84188cf4fa39","amp;dn":"Beach+Red+%281967%29+Xvid+1cd+-+War+Drama+-+Cornel+Wilde%2C+Jean+Walla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b06964f19beb23fcc4156d57b1f84188cf4fa39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,6,150,79,25,190,178,63,204,65,86,213,123,31,132,24,140,244,250,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
