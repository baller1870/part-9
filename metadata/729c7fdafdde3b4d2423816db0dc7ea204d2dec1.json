Colombia plays an important role in Putumayo&amp;#039;s history, as company founder Dan Storper was inspired to name his original clothing and handcrafts company after the stunning Putumayo River valley he visited in 1974. \nThe music of Colombia has yet to make an international splash like Cuban music has in recent years, but everyone who is familiar with Latin America&amp;#039;s third largest country knows that it is likely to be the source of the next big thing in Latin music. Fans of the straight-to-the-bone grooves of Cuban music will find the music of Colombia equally entrancing and soulful. \nDiscover the instantly engaging music of Colombia with this fun, accessible collection of music that will light up any fiesta. The extensive liner notes are in English and Spanish, and the 32-page booklet features artist photos as well as beautiful images of Colombia. \n\nTracklist:\nLos 50 de Joselito - Montanerisimo \nLos Warahuaco - La Tuna \nGabriel Romero - Las Lavanderas \nJoe Arroyo - Yamulemau \nLucho Bermudez - Fiesta de Negritos \nToto la Momposina - Oye Manita \nGrupo Bahia - A Guapi \nTulio Zuloaga - Temporal \nFruko y sus Tesos - Soy Como Soy \nLa Sonora Dinamita - El Cicl?n \nOrquesta de Edmundo Arias - Cumbia del Caribe \nThe Latin Brothers - Delia La Cumbiambera \n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:729c7fdafdde3b4d2423816db0dc7ea204d2dec1","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Colombia+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"729c7fdafdde3b4d2423816db0dc7ea204d2dec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,156,127,218,253,222,59,77,36,35,129,109,176,220,126,162,4,210,222,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
