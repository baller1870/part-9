It's easy to pray along with, and easy to pray along with every day.\n\nYears ago, there were several popular Rosary recordings on the market. Many featured beautiful songs, special prayers, and inspirational meditations. They were quite lengthy and usually cost $15 and $20 each. Nice, but not very practical.\n\nOur version is a simple voice recording (only 17 minutes in length) and it exploded in popularity. Every year, year after year, it's the most popular recording we distribute. This is because it's the perfect &quot;every day&quot; rosary recording. There are no extra prayers or distracting music. It features pleasant male and female voices at a normal paceÃ¢â‚¬â€œneither ponderous nor rushed.\n\nIt's pretty much the best Rosary you can own for a daily commute in the car to work or on your way to pick up the kids from school. It's perfect for your kitchen or workshop. It makes the Family Rosary much easier for the little ones.\n\nAnd it's a wonderful gift for teaching others to pray the Rosary. So when you order free copies for yourself and your family, consider getting extras for your friends, fellow parishioners, and coworkers.\n\nORDER YOUR FREE CD COPIES ONLINE NOW\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.catholicity.com/cds/rosary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.catholicity.com/cds/rosary.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nCatholiCity runs a large deficit each year because we give away free life-changing Catholic CDs, booklets and novels.
