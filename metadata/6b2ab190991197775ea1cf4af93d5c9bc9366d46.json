Covering all aspects of patient-centered care in the practice of physical medicine and rehabilitation, the book provides a competency-based approach to topics and conditions commonly encountered in this specialty. Thoughtfully organized chapters offer easy-to-access clinical content for all major practice areas, and the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s competency-based goals and objectives also serve as a clear platform for educating physiatrists in training during their clinical rotations. The first part of the book presents the foundations of the core competencies (medical knowledge, professionalism, patient care, practice-based learning and improvement, system-based practice, and interpersonal and communication skills) with basic principles for application, and also includes chapters on implementing educational Milestones, core professional education principles, and building leadership skills. In the second part, experts in the field apply these core competencies to the management of common conditions including stroke, spinal cord and brain injury, amputation and prosthetics, musculoskeletal disorders, multiple sclerosis, and much more. Each of these chapters identifies goals and objectives for each competency and concludes with a representative case study and self-assessment questions with answers and explanations. The book also provides references to key articles and links to internet-based educational materials. Practical tips, how-to and where-to guides, key points, tables, and charts also help to maintain current knowledge and competency in the many areas that comprise the field of PM&amp;R. The book will be a valuable asset to physiatrists in training, program directors, and teaching faculty in rehabilitation medicine training programs, and for continuing professional development. \n\nKey Features: \n\n- Addresses core competencies for rehabilitation medicine physicians as required by the ACGME \n- Covers all major physiatric practice areas with facts, concepts, goals, and objectives following the competency model \n- Grounded in a holistic, patient-centered approach \n- Presents sample case studies with discussion points and self-assessment questions with answer key and explanations for each area to track progress and build clinical acumen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b2ab190991197775ea1cf4af93d5c9bc9366d46","amp;dn":"Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation+Patient-Centered+Care+%5BStor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b2ab190991197775ea1cf4af93d5c9bc9366d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,42,177,144,153,17,151,119,94,161,207,74,249,61,92,155,201,54,109,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
