At the outbreak of World War II, the Slow But Deadly Dauntless was considered by many to be obsolete.\n\nThe Dauntless was the only US aircraft to participate in all five Naval engagements that were fought exclusively between aircraft carriers, and despite having been marked for retirement even before the war began, the Dauntless sunk more enemy shipping during 1942 than all other aircraft combined.\n\nBuilt only for FSX SP1, SP2 and Acceleration (no planned version for FS9), the SBD Dauntless has a highly detailed virtual cockpit complete with 3d gauges and authentic textures, as well as switches to arm and drop the bomb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af715da3e55daf918a1349d2233d6e6dd2ca4cc","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Vertigo+Studios+-+SBD+Dauntless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af715da3e55daf918a1349d2233d6e6dd2ca4cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,247,21,218,62,85,218,249,24,161,52,157,34,51,214,230,221,44,164,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
