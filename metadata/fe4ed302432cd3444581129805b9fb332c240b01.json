You can create these modules with the fragment class, which behaves somewhat like a nested activity that can define its own layout and manage its own lifecycle. When a fragment specifies its own layout, it can be configured in different combinations with other fragments inside an activity to modify your layout configuration for different screen sizes (a small screen might show one fragment at a time, but a large screen can show two or more).\n\nCreating Dynamic UI with Android Fragments shows you how to create modern Android applications that meet the high expectations of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s users. You will learn how to incorporate rich navigation features like swipe-based screen browsing and how to create adaptive UIs that ensure your application looks fantastic whether run on a low cost smartphone or the latest tablet.\n\nThis book looks at the impact fragments have on Android UI design and their role in both simplifying many common UI challenges and providing new ways to incorporate rich UI behaviors.\n\nYou will learn how to use fragments to create UIs that automatically adapt to device differences. We look closely at the roll of fragment transactions and how to work with the Android back stack. Leveraging this understanding, we then explore several specialized fragment-related classes like ListFragment and DialogFragment as well as rich navigation features like swipe-based screen browsing.\n\nApproach:\n\nA fast-paced tutorial that guides you through everything you need to know about dynamic UI design for Android devices.\n\nWho this book is for:\n\nThis book is for developers with a basic understanding of Android programming who would like to improve the appearance and usability of their applications. Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to create a more interactive user experience, create more dynamically adaptive UIs, provide better support for tablets and smartphones in a single app, reduce the complexity of managing your app UIs, or you are just trying to expand your UI design philosophy, then this book is for you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe4ed302432cd3444581129805b9fb332c240b01","amp;dn":"Creating+Dynamic+UI+with+Android+Fragments+-+PDF+%2B+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe4ed302432cd3444581129805b9fb332c240b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,78,211,2,67,44,211,68,69,129,18,152,5,185,251,51,44,36,11,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
