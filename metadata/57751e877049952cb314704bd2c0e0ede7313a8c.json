Nekoashido is the 'cat style' sub-system of Mizuumi ryu, which is the hybrid style of martial arts I created, and still develop. The 'five attitudes' describe the more abstract concepts of Nekoashido. They can apply not only to combat, but also to freedom of expression in movement, and living life. Think carefully about the concepts below as you train and set goals for your own personal development of athletic ability. Skill, grace, and ease in movement are highly valued.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/2012/09/mizuumi.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.johnstonkarate.com/2012/09/mizuumi.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57751e877049952cb314704bd2c0e0ede7313a8c","amp;dn":"Nekoashido+-+Cat+Style+of+Karate+-+In+Terms+of+the+Five+Elements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57751e877049952cb314704bd2c0e0ede7313a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,117,30,135,112,73,149,44,179,20,112,75,210,192,224,237,231,49,58,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
