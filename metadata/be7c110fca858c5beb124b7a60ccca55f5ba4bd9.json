Formed in 1969, War was a musical crossover band which fused elements of rock, funk, jazz, Latin, rhythm and blues, and reggae. The band also transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up. War was also subject to many line-up changes over the course of its formation, leaving member Leroy &quot;Lonnie&quot; Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7c110fca858c5beb124b7a60ccca55f5ba4bd9","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+WAR++and+More+%5Bfunk%5D+1987+-+MP3-320+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7c110fca858c5beb124b7a60ccca55f5ba4bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,124,17,15,202,133,140,91,235,18,75,122,96,204,202,85,245,186,75,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
