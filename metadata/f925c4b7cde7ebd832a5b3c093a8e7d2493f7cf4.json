This &quot;anthology of sacred choral music&quot; spans 400 years and includes such masterpieces as Allegri&amp;#039;s Miserere, Bach&amp;#039;s &quot;Jesu, joy of man&amp;#039;s desiring,&quot; and Barber&amp;#039;s exquisite Agnus Dei, which is the composer&amp;#039;s choral setting of his famous Adagio for Strings. Along the way we also hear Mozart&amp;#039;s sublime &quot;Ave verum corpus,&quot; Elgar&amp;#039;s &quot;Lux aeterna,&quot; and the Kyrie from Palestrina&amp;#039;s Missa Papae Marcelli. There has been a choir at England&amp;#039;s New College, Oxford, since the year 1379, and this impressive line of experience shows in the intelligent, unfaltering, and finely polished performances by today&amp;#039;s ensemble of 16 boys and 12 adults.\n\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f925c4b7cde7ebd832a5b3c093a8e7d2493f7cf4","amp;dn":"AGNUS+DEI+-+Music+of+Inner+Harmony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f925c4b7cde7ebd832a5b3c093a8e7d2493f7cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,37,196,183,205,231,235,216,50,165,179,192,147,168,231,210,73,63,124,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
