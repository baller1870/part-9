It is a tour de force ... to write mathematical sections that are both complete and at an appropriate academic level. The authors have clearly succeeded in this challenge, making this a remarkable pedagogical book ... The choice of exercises is excellent and possibly the best feature of the book. In summary, this textbook is a great reference at undergraduate levels, particularly for those who like to teach or learn using lots of examples and exercises.' R. Botet, European Journal of Physics\n\n'... the book provides scientists who need to use the tool of mathematics for practical purposes with a single, comprehensive book. I recommend this book not only to students in physics and engineering sciences, but also to students in other fields of natural sciences.' P. Steward, Optik\n\n'... suitable as a textbook for undergraduate use ... this is a book that in view of its content and its modest softcover price, will find its way on to many bookshelves.' Nigel Steele, The Times Higher Education Supplement\n\n'Riley et al. has clear, thorough and straightforward explanations of the subjects treated. It rigorously adopts a three-stage approach throughout the book: first a heuristic, intuitive introduction, then a formal treatment, and finally one or two examples. This consistent presentation, the layout, and the print quality make the book most attractive ... and value for money. It contains a thousand pages, there are plenty of exercises with each chapter.' J. M. Thijssen, European Journal of Physics\n\n'This textbook is a well-written, modern, comprehensive, and complete collection of topics in mathematical methods ranging from a review of differential and integral calculus to group and representation theory, probability, the calculus of variations, and tensors.' Science Books and Films \n\nProduct Description\nThis set consists of the third edition of this highly acclaimed undergraduate textbook and its solutions manual containing complete worked solutions to half of the problems. Suitable for teaching all the mathematics for an undergraduate course in any of the physical sciences, the text provides lucid descriptions of all the topics, many worked examples, and over 800 exercises. New stand-alone chapters give a systematic account of the 'special functions' of physical science, cover an extended range of practical applications of complex variables, and give an introduction to quantum operators. Further tabulations, of relevance in statistics and numerical integration, have been added. In this edition, the remaining exercises have no hints, answers or worked solutions and can be used for unaided homework; full solutions are available to instructors on a password-protected web site, www.cambridge.org/9780521679718. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0d0d7ec9e344fdc2367bf4bb4afc13f7a95473","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Methods+for+Physics+and+Engineering%2C+Third+Edition+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0d0d7ec9e344fdc2367bf4bb4afc13f7a95473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,13,13,126,201,227,68,253,194,54,123,244,187,74,252,19,247,169,84,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
