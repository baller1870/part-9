RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......:  Activation\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Racing\n\nNeed for Speed is going back to its roots and that can mean only one thing\npolice chases and ridiculously expensive supercars. Hot Pursuit doesn't make\nany claims to be the most realistic racer out there, even compared to\nprevious games, but it does aim to be the most fun\n\nYou can play either as cops or racers, but both sides get ultra powerful\ncars and a range of power-ups to get them to the race's end. If you're a cop\nyour job is to chase down your quarry using any means necessary, including\nroadblocks\n\nIf you're playing as a racer you'll often be in a slower car than your\npursuer, but you won't be tied to any of their rules and get your own\npowerful power-ups like the radar jammer\n\n2. Burn or mount the image\n3. Install the game. Cancel when prompted for activation\n4. Use our key generator located in the /Crack dir on the DVD to activate\n5. Play the game. But don't go online\n6.
