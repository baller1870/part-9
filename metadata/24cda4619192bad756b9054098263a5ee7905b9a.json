Doing the labor of comparison gives us the means to ascertain the historicity of the two extraordinary regimes and the wreckage they have left. With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, scholars of Europe are no longer burdened with the political baggage that constricted research and conditioned interpretation and have access to hitherto closed archives. The time is right for a fresh look at the two gigantic dictatorships of the twentieth century and for a return to the original intent of thought on totalitarian regimes - understanding the intertwined trajectories of socialism and nationalism in European and global history.\n\nPaperback: 548 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (December 8, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521723973\nISBN-13: 978-0521723978\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24cda4619192bad756b9054098263a5ee7905b9a","amp;dn":"Beyond+Totalitarianism+Stalinism+And+Nazism+Compared+By+Michael+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24cda4619192bad756b9054098263a5ee7905b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,205,164,97,145,146,186,215,86,185,5,64,152,38,58,94,231,144,91,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
