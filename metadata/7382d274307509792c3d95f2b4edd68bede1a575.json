It is regarded by many critics as a quintessential example of hippie culture, with its promotion of ideas such as communal living, eastern mysticism and pantheism.\n\nThe album was a major commercial success in the UK, staying in the charts for 27 weeks with a peak of #5. It has sold 800,000 copies in the UK to date. In the U.S., the ISB always remained underground and the album struggled to #161 on the Billboard 200. However, it was nominated for a Grammy in the folk music category.The\n album featured a series of vividly dreamlike Robin Williamson songs, such as &quot;The Minotaur's Song&quot;, a surreal music-hall parody told from the point of view of the mythical beast, and its centrepiece was Mike Heron's &quot;A Very Cellular Song&quot;, a 13-minute reflection on life, love and amoebas; its complex structure incorporated a Bahamian spiritual (&quot;I Bid You Goodnight&quot;, originally recorded by the Pinder Family) and an adaptation of a Sikh hymn (&quot;May the pure light within you&quot;). It had a layered production, using multi-track recording techniques and a very wide array of instruments from all corners of the world, including sitar, gimbri, shenai, oud, harpsichord, panpipes and kazoo.\n \n&quot;Koeeoaddi There&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 \n&quot;The Minotaur's Song&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 \n&quot;Witches Hat&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33 \n&quot;A Very Cellular Song&quot; (Heron) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 13:09 \n&quot;Mercy I Cry City&quot; (Heron) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46 \n&quot;Waltz of the New Moon&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10 \n&quot;The Water Song&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50 \n&quot;Three Is a Green Crown&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:46 \n&quot;Swift as the Wind&quot; (Heron) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53 \n&quot;Nightfall&quot; (Williamson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/25/incredible-string-band/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/25/incredible-string-band/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7382d274307509792c3d95f2b4edd68bede1a575","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+String+Band...The+Hangman%5C%27s+Beautiful+Daughter%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7382d274307509792c3d95f2b4edd68bede1a575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,130,210,116,48,117,9,121,44,61,149,242,180,237,214,139,237,225,165,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
