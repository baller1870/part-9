Many years have passed, but still the CD is in my car and the album downloaded onto my iPod for my many business trips abroad.\n\nI can't really put my finger on what it is about this album that makes me want to keep playing it but many, many albums have come and gone since I originally bought this one, some of which I thought I would never tire of, and yet Bizarro is still top of the pile.\n\nFrom the opening intro' of &quot;Brassneck&quot;, through the haunting lyrics of &quot;What Have I Said Now?&quot; to the near seven-minute guitar-led instrumental of &quot;Take Me&quot;, every track seems to be so strong and nothing carries that over-produced sound so common nowadays. In saying that my favourite track is &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, one of the extras on this version of the album, which carries some of Dave Gedges trademark cutting lyrics so common throughout Wedding Present tunes.\n\nOk, so Martin Stephenson and the Daintee's &quot;Boat to Bolivia&quot; comes close, but for me Bizarro is THE album I want to grow old with and as I happily enter middle-age it is still hitting the spot. My kids love it, I love it and my wife even likes a couple of tracks - proof positive if it is ever needed.\n\nI tell you, I'll be dancing around the residential home to this in twenty-odd years time! \n\nTracklisting:\n1\tBrassneck\t(4:52)\n2\tCrushed\t(2:44)\n3\tNo\t(4:12)\n4\tThanks\t(2:23)\n5\tKennedy\t(4:21)\n6\tWhat Have I Said Now\t(5:20)\n7\tGranadaland\t(4:49)\n8\tBewitched\t(6:44)\n9\tTake Me!\t(9:20)\n10\tBe Honest\t(2:42)\n\n2001 UK Remastered and Expanded\n\nBrassneck [original version] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:52\nCrushed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:32\nNo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\nThanks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:22\nKennedy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\nWhat Have I Said Now?
