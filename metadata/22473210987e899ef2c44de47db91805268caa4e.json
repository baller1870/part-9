It was a time when all these older stars started to integrate digital drum-triggers and echoey synthesizer lines into their tracks, and when the Barrington Levy/Yellowman style of nonsensical stutter-scatting was blowing up. Riddimentary isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a wide-ranging dance party; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mix that maintains a single mood and a single tempo throughout. You could dance to it, if you wanted, but you could also wash dishes or read a book or drive down a highway in the middle of the night.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tGreensleeves\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Who Is The Ruler - Alpha &amp; Omega\n02.Jacqueline - Hugh Mundell\n03.Joker Smoker - Triston Palma\n04.Police In Helicopter - John Holt\n05.Eventide Fire A Disaster (Edit) - Barrington Levy &amp; General Echo\n06.Satta Amassa (Gana Version) - Joe Gibbs\n07.Fattie Boom Boom - Rankin Dread\n08.Anarexol - Eek-A-Mouse\n09.Gunshot Mek Daughtor Drop - Lone Ranger\n10.Sweet Sweet Matilda - Clint Eastwood &amp; General Saint\n11.Interface - Prince Jammy\n12.Night Nurse - Gregory Isaacs\n13.Telephone Love - J.C.
