During this period, when the Metaxas dictatorship subjected all song lyrics to censorship, song composers would rewrite lyrics, or practice self-censorship before submitting lyrics for approval. \nThe music itself was not subject to censorship, although proclamations were made recommending the &quot;europeanisation&quot; of the regarded outcoming Anatolian music, which led to certain radio stations banning &quot;amanedes&quot; in 1938, i.e. on the basis of music rather than lyrics. This was, however, not bouzouki music. The term amanedes, refers to a kind of improvised sung lament, in ummeasured time, sung in a particular dromos/makam. The amanedes were perhaps the most pointedly oriental kind of songs in the Greek repertoire of the time.\n\nReferences to drugs and other criminal or disreputable activities now vanished from recordings made in Greek studios, to reappear briefly in the first recordings made at the resumption of recording activity in 1946. In the United States, however, a flourishing Greek musical production continued, with song lyrics apparently unaffected by censorship, (see below) although, strangely, the bouzouki continued to be rare on American recordings until after WWII (wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe womb of rebetika was the jail and the hash den. It was there that the early rebetes created their songs. \nThey sang in quiet, hoarse voices, unforced, one after the other, each singer adding a verse which often bore no relation to the previous verse, and a song often went on for hours. There was no refrain, and the melody was simple and easy. \nOne rebetis accompanied the singer with a bouzouki or a baglamas (a smaller version of the bouzouki, very portable, easy to make in prison and easy to hide from the police), and perhaps another, moved by the music, would get up and dance. The early rebetika songs, particularly the love songs, were based on Greek folk songs and the songs of the Greeks of Smyrna and Constantinople.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Elias Petropoulos\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/6179/frontkm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/6179/frontkm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nApagorevmena Rempetika 1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n01.
