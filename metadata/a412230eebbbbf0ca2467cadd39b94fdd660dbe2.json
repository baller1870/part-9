However, theses disciplines have developed independently, and therefore the demand for a comprehensive work featuring the fundamentals of photonic polymers is greater than ever.\nThis volume focuses on Polymer Optical Fiber and their applications. The first part of the book introduces typical optical fibers according to their classifications of material, propagating mode, and structure. Optical properties, the high bandwidth POF and transmission loss are discussed, followed by an outline on the propagating mode characteristics and how they affect the performances of the fiber.\nThe second part of the book reviews conventional materials of POFs and gives an overview on fabrication methods. This is followed by a survey of characterization methods. Based on the characteristics of optical communication systems, the last chapter will concentrate on the many advantages of POF in link and network design.\nWritten by a top expert in the field, this is an invaluable resource for semiconductor physicists, materials scientists, polymer chemists, electrical engineers, and those working in the semiconductor industry.\n\nProduct Description\nAbout the Author\nYasuhiro Koike obtained his Ph.D. at Keio University where he has been a Professor since 1992. He spent a year at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories as a visiting researcher in 1989. He influenced the inventions of GradedÃ¢â‚¬â€œIndex Polymer Optical Fiber, HighlyÃ¢â‚¬â€œScattered Optical Transmission Polymer, and other novelties. His awards include the Honorary Doctorate of Eindhoven University of Technology, NL, the International Technology Award of the Society of Plastic Engineers (SPE), and the Award of the Society of Polymer Science. He was appointed as an Affiliate Professor of the University of Washington in 2009.\n\nPublisher: Wiley VCH (17 December 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3527410066\nISBN-13: 978-3527410064","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a412230eebbbbf0ca2467cadd39b94fdd660dbe2","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Plastic+Optical+Fibers%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a412230eebbbbf0ca2467cadd39b94fdd660dbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,18,35,14,235,187,191,12,162,70,124,173,211,155,148,253,214,96,219,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
