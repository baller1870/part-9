It is first and foremost a story of calculated terror and systematic violence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So begins Frank DikÃƒÂ¶tterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunning and revelatory chronicle of Mao ZedongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ascension and campaign to transform the Chinese into what the party called New People. Following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, after a bloody civil war, Mao hoisted the red flag over BeijingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Forbidden City, and the world watched as the Communist revolution began to wash away the old order. Due to the secrecy surrounding the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s records, little has been known before now about the eight years that followed, preceding the massive famine and Great Leap Forward.\n\n2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a71b2e2dadc95d0b80683d77c9e034cfa7df54","amp;dn":"The+Tragedy+of+Liberation%3A+Chinese+Revolution+1945-1957+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a71b2e2dadc95d0b80683d77c9e034cfa7df54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,167,27,46,45,173,201,93,11,128,104,61,119,201,224,52,207,167,223,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
