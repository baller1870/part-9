The pair always inhabited the more polished end of the folk-rock spectrum and was sometimes criticized for a certain collegiate sterility. Many also feel that Simon, as both a singer and songwriter, didn't truly blossom until he began his own hugely successful solo career in the 1970s. But the best of S&amp;G's work can stand among Simon's best material, and the duo did progress musically over the course of their five albums, moving from basic folk-rock productions into Latin rhythms and gospel-influenced arrangements that foreshadowed Simon's eclecticism on his solo albums. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA &amp; 99.47% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\tC2K 90716\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.
