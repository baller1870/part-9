With Hotspot PRO you can transform your PC into a real Wi-Fi hotspot, and share your computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Internet connection as Wi-Fi with any other PC or mobile device.\n\nConnectify Hotspot lets you share your computer's Internet connection with other devices over Wi-Fi.As long as your computer is online, your other nearby devices - and friends and colleagues - will be, too.\n\nGot a 3G or 4G adapter for your laptop? With Hotspot PRO, now all your other Wi-Fi devices can use that connection, too. Media players, e-readers, other laptops, you name it.\n\nHotspot's Fling feature lets you easily send any file from one device to another within Wi-Fi range. Stop emailing files to yourself and passing USB drives. You don't even need an Internet connection. Even works with mobile phones (download only).\n\nAt Home\nHotspot PRO can act as your primary router or even a Wi-Fi extender for your home router. With just a few clicks you'll instantly have Wi-Fi in that hard to reach basement or bedroom!\n\nOn the Road\nFor the modern traveler, Internet connectivity is a lifeline. Airports, Hotels, and Coffee Shops know this and charge accordingly for Wi-Fi access or only supply you with an ethernet jack, which leaves Wi-Fi only devices and smart phones in the dark. With Connectify Hotspot PRO, just start Internet connection sharing with one click, and get all of your devices online simultaneously, and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAt Work or School\nMany colleges, schools, businesses, and private institutions have restrictive limits on the amount of devices an individual can have registered to their wireless networks. These quotas are quickly exceeded by variety of Wi-Fi enabled devices we use on a regular basis. With Hotspot PRO running on a laptop or desktop PC, you can circumvent these limits and securely connect any number of devices to your personal Wi-Fi network.\n\nOffline Networking\nEven without an active Internet connection, you can still run a wireless network with Connectify Hotspot PRO. This allows you to Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ files to other Wi-Fi devices, provide wireless access to shared folders or drives on your network, as well as play LAN games with others.\n\nGreat news, a new release of Connectify 6 is available now! This release was completely driven by feedback that we received on the software at our new Community Portal.\nCommunity members told us what they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happy with in Connectify, and we fixed it. (Hint: if there are things that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to discuss about the software, you should join us there as well).\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the list of what has changed since 6.0:\nFix endless upgrade window popups\nFix Hotspot UI window title not changing on license activation\nAutomatically work around DAP 10 bug that caused Dispatch Dashboard to be stuck loading\nHandle adapters which do not report an MTU\nFix client network access icons not updating when hotspot-wide firewall settings changed\nSupport larger client lists (over 100). We were delighted to see that at least one person really had a list of 122 clients which had connected to their hotspot.\nFix Ethernet-mode existing DHCP server detection\nFix XBox client icon\n\n\nALL Right (c) K u r d - T e a M ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6e2569bf009798e4d2b26125c85f99c92935c1","amp;dn":"Connectify+HotSpot+PRO+v6.0.0.28615+Final+Incl+Crack+-+Ak0-DLL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6e2569bf009798e4d2b26125c85f99c92935c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,110,37,105,191,0,151,152,228,210,178,97,37,200,95,153,201,41,53,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
