From the freezing Antarctic to the scorching tropics, 50 spy cameras capture unique footage of three extraordinary species.Emperor penguins cross a treacherous frozen sea to reach their breeding grounds, and on the way one becomes lost in a blizzard. Once there, the females flipper flight over the males and those that succeed 'waddle walk' with their partners. They must lay their eggs without touching the ice, but it is the males that face the greatest challenge - overwintering alone in the coldest place on earth.\n\nFirst Steps-Episode 2 of 3\n\nWatched by spycams, chicks are hatching out all over. Male emperors form an identity parade before handing over their newborns to the returning females. The mothers shuffle into a huddle to protect their offspring from a blizzard. Outside, one tiny chick doesn't make it and lies frozen by his mother. Chickcam films the young ones walking on their mothers' feet and taking their own first unsteady steps. Females without young try to kidnap the new arrivals and giant petrels force the chicks to huddle for protection.\n\nGrowing Up-Episode 3 of 3\n\nThe chicks are growing up fast and becoming increasingly independent. Emperor and rockhopper chicks are placed in a creche as their parents go fishing. The Humboldts are left in their burrows, as the adults enjoy a soft landing of feathers by a beach swarming with cormorants.Packed in a huddle, the emperor chicks have to be identity checked before they are fed, and their parents are swamped by hungry impostors. Giant petrels are an ever-present danger, while vampire bats target the Humboldts. As the young grow bigger and preen out baby fluff they sport punk hairdos. The emperor chicks go skating on a newly-formed ice rink, while the rockhopper chicks practice jumping skills.\n\n\ncast\n\nDirected by John Downer  \nNarrated by David Tennant\nProduction BBC\n\n\n\n\nVideo:-\n\nFormat: mp4/H.264/MPEG-4 AVC/&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;420a2b252a020e766c72&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nCodec ID: Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 58mn -59mn\nAverage Bitrate: 3 000 Kbps\nMaximum Bitrate: 19.3 Mbps\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nAdvanced Encoding: rc=2pass\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.130\nMenu: Yes\n\nAudio:-\n\nFormat: AAC\nBitrate: 230/240 Kbps\nChannels: 2ch Front: L R\nSample Rate: 48 KHz\nLanguage: English\n\nRelease info:-\n\nEncoder: tomcat12\nFile Size: 1.30/1.40 GiB\nSource: Blu-ray-NTb/Scan type-MBAFF/25.000 fps[Thanks]\nBluray Release Date: 2013\nSample: -\nSubtitles: English\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ojXrqrN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ojXrqrN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/uzrzPJC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/uzrzPJC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/uYA08hs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/uYA08hs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nGreetz To: SaM |oziman|taker|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|Extratorrent|.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112647ca4fba0c7381b51c58fa4fd8b01d6f61aa","amp;dn":"BBC+Penguins+Spy+in+the+Huddle+%5B2013%5D+720p+BluRay+AAC+x264-tomca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112647ca4fba0c7381b51c58fa4fd8b01d6f61aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,38,71,202,79,186,12,115,129,181,28,88,250,79,216,176,29,111,97,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
