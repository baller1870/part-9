Forced to think fast, the producer decides to digitally create an actress &quot;Simone&quot; to sub for the star--the first totally believable synthetic actress. The &quot;actress&quot; becomes an overnight sensation, with a major singing career as well, and everyone thinks she's a real person. However, as Simone's fame skyrockets, he cannot bear to admit his fraud to himself or the world.\n\n        Al Pacino\t ... \tViktor Taransky   \n\tBenjamin Salisbury\t... \tProduction Assistant\n\n\tWinona Ryder\t... \tNicola Anders\n\tDarnell Williams\t... \tStudio Executive #1\n\n\tJim Rash\t... \tStudio Executive #2\n\n\tRon Perkins\t... \tStudio Executive #3 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258153/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258153/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10cf17162fd80edd834c815377edc685d70d0321","amp;dn":"SimOne.DVDRip.XviD%28Al+Pacino%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10cf17162fd80edd834c815377edc685d70d0321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,207,23,22,47,216,14,221,131,76,129,83,119,237,198,133,215,13,3,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
