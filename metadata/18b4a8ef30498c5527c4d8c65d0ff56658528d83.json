Formed in 1993, the band offered an innovative mix of metal, punk, and ragga, inheriting the punk-reggae legacy of The Clash and Bad Brains.[citation needed] Their lyrics were thoughtful and idealistic drawing comparisons with the former, though musically they were closer to the hard rock sound of the latter.[citation needed] Fans consider the band to have been pioneers of a new genre, 'ragga metal'.[citation needed]\n\nThey released only two albums via the metal label, Earache Records. They were 1995s Pain and Wrong Side of Beautiful the following year. The Dub War experience was short-lived as the band split in 1999. This separation resulted from disputes with their label.\n\nMembres:\nBenji Webbe (Vocals)\nJeff Rose (Guitar)\nRichie Glover (Bass)\nMartin &quot;Ginge&quot; Ford (Drums)\n\n\nAlbums, Remixes, singles and EPs in torrent:\nEnemy Maker (Single) CD1 and CD2\nPain\nRight Side Of Beautiful (The Remixes)\nStep Ta Dis\nStrike It (Single) CD1 and CD2\nWords Of Dubwarning EP\nWrong Side Of Beautiful\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b4a8ef30498c5527c4d8c65d0ff56658528d83","amp;dn":"Dub+War+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b4a8ef30498c5527c4d8c65d0ff56658528d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,180,168,239,48,73,140,85,39,196,216,198,93,15,245,102,88,82,141,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
