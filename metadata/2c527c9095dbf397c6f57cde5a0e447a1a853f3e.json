The first 33-minute track features a guided meditation and visualization by John Dupuy that lasts for about 12 minutes. The second track features the same powerful entrainment sounds but without the guided meditation. The guided meditation is designed to take you into the depths where healing and transformation happen. It is suggested that deep recovery become part of a daily, ongoing internal transformational practice. \n\nHow to Optimize Using Deep Recovery \n\nTrack 1 is very helpful for beginning meditators, as it has a voice-guided meditation to ease you into your inner work and get you into a deep transformational zone. It is optimal to use Track 1 in the early morning, as it sets a groove for your entire day. Track 1 is a continuous 33-minute track. \n\nTrack 2 can be a standalone meditation. Please use either Track 1 or Track 2 as you feel intuitively guided. A good use of Track 2, especially in the early days of your recovery journey, is to listen to this one in the late afternoon or evening, which is often when we crave drugs and alcohol the most. Of course, you can use Track 2 at any time of day when cravings arise as well. \n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125 \n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c527c9095dbf397c6f57cde5a0e447a1a853f3e","amp;dn":"iAwake+Technologies+-+Deep+Recovery+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c527c9095dbf397c6f57cde5a0e447a1a853f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,82,124,144,149,219,243,151,198,245,124,222,90,14,68,122,26,133,63,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
