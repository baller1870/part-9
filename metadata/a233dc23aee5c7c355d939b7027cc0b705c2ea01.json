The director co-stars as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the film's eponymous female lead, played by Diane Keaton. Allen has described the film as &quot;a major turning point&quot;, which, unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, introduced a level of seriousness where, he says, he &quot;had the courage to abandon ... just clowning around and the safety of complete broad comedy. I said to myself, 'I think I will try and make some deeper film and not be as funny in the same way. And maybe there will be other values that will emerge, that will be interesting or nourishing for the audience.'&quot;\n\nThe film was produced by Allen's veteran manager, Charles H. Joffe, and was met with widespread critical acclaim. Along with the 1978 Academy Award for Best Picture, Annie Hall won Oscars in three other categories: two for Allen (Best Director and, with Brickman, Best Original Screenplay), and Keaton for Best Actress. Its North American box office receipts of $38,251,425 are fourth-best in the director's oeuvre when not adjusted for inflation. Often listed among the greatest film comedies, it ranks 31st on AFI's list of the top feature films in American cinema, fourth on their list of top comedy films and number 28 on Bravo's &quot;100 FunniestFilm critic Roger Ebert calls it &quot;just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie&quot;.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlvy Singer, un tipo algo neurÃƒÂ³tico, trabaja como humorista en clubs nocturnos. A sus 40 aÃƒÂ±os, tras romper con Annie, su ÃƒÂºltima novia, reflexiona sobre su vida, rememorando sus amores, sus matrimonios, pero muy en especial su relaciÃƒÂ³n con Annie, a la que conociÃƒÂ³ en una cancha de tenis. Al final, llega a la conclusiÃƒÂ³n de que son sus manÃƒÂ­as y obsesiones las que siempre acaban arruinando su relaciÃƒÂ³n con las mujeres.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a233dc23aee5c7c355d939b7027cc0b705c2ea01","amp;dn":"Annie+Hall+-+%28English+%2F+Spanish+Subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a233dc23aee5c7c355d939b7027cc0b705c2ea01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,51,220,35,174,229,199,195,85,217,57,183,2,124,192,183,5,194,234,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
