But it was guitarist Martin Barre's swaggering riff off the title track of the band's fourth album that would become Tull's indelibly clichÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“d trademark--and the band's entrÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“e into a long reign as arena-rock perennials. But there's a lot more to Aqualung than the riffage of that cut and its cousins, &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot; and &quot;Locomotive Breath.&quot; In an era when pseudo-Christian spirituality was a de rigueur, if cheap, musical commodity (from the overblown operatics of Jesus Christ Superstar to one-hit pop wonders such as &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand&quot;), Anderson and company\nopenly challenged the value of organized religion with a thematic album savvy enough to layer its thought-provoking lyrics between heavy strata of FM-friendly guitar bedrock. A clichÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“, perhaps; a landmark, no doubt. And a record many maintain is still Tull's finest hour.\n--Jerry McCulley\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Aqualung                                             [06:37]\n02.Cross-Eyed mary                                      [04:09]\n03.Cheap day return                                     [01:23]\n04.Mother goose                                         [03:53]\n05.Wond'ring aloud                                      [01:56]\n06.Up to me                                             [03:15]\n07.My god                                               [07:13]\n08.Hymn 43                                              [03:19]\n09.Slipstream                                           [01:13]\n10.Locomotive breath                                    [04:26]\n11.Wind up                                              [06:08]\n12.Lick your fingers clean                              [02:46]\n13.Wind up (quad version)                               [05:24]\n14.Excerpts form the ian anderson interview             [13:59]\n15.Songs for jeffrey (BBC 1968)                         [02:51]\n16.Fat man (BBC 1968)                                   [02:57]\n17.Bouree (BBC 1968)                                    [03:58]\n____\n\n75:27 min\n105,5 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2609ef8b2dfd7334b945d8191bfc1c376468620","amp;dn":"Jethro_Tull-Aqualung-%28Retail%29-1971-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2609ef8b2dfd7334b945d8191bfc1c376468620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,96,158,248,178,223,215,51,75,148,93,129,145,191,193,195,118,70,134,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
