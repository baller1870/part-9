This is not your fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Parachute; and not your motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, either. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be astounded at the changes. This book keeps building--in insight, helpfulness, relevance, and urgency--through new invention and information each year. And this year itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the critical resource to help Americans (and others) get back to work.\n \n \nFor forty years now job-hunters and career-changers have been turning to this, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular job-hunting book, confident that each new annual edition will give them the most up-to-date information about the job-market and how to find meaningful work--even in the midst of challenging economic times such as these.\n \n \nThis yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s edition of What Color Is Your Parachute? has been vastly rewritten, because job-hunting has increasingly become a survival skill. Career expert Richard N. Bolles describes the five strategies most needed to survive, and explains how to incorporate social media tools such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter into your job-search.\n \n \nThe new ideas are wrapped around the familiar core message of Parachute: WHAT, WHERE, and HOW, with an emphasis on finding your passion and identifying your best transferable skills. With fresh insights into resumes, networking, interviewing, salary negotiation, and how to start your own business, this book will give you the tools, exercises, and motivation you need to find hope, land a job, and fulfill your purpose in life.
