It was a complex, harmonically and rhythmically challenging musical statement.[citation needed] Hancock was no stranger to electronic music, having used synthesisers extensively during his short time with Warner Bros. Records, but Sextant took his sound to a new level.\n\nWhile a select few praised his new approach, Hancock alienated the bulk of his audience, who found his sound extremely inaccessible.[citation needed] Made up of just three tracks, the funkier elements of tracks such as &quot;Hornets&quot;, also point toward the commercial success he would enjoy in the 80s with Future Shock and Sound-System, among others.\n\nHancock's first recording on Columbia would be his last recording with his Mwandishi-era group, with Sextant's poor album sales influencing his move into more mainstream music with Head Hunters.[citation needed]\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs by Herbie Hancock\n\n    &quot;Rain Dance&quot; - 9:16\n    &quot;Hidden Shadows&quot; - 10:11\n    &quot;Hornets&quot; - 19:35\n\nPersonnel\n\n    MWANDISHI (Herbie Hancock) - Piano, Fender Rhodes, Hohner D6 Clavinet, Mellotron, ARP 2600, ARP Pro Soloist, Moog\n    MWILE (Bennie Maupin) - Soprano Sax, Bass Clarinet, Piccolo, Afuche, Hum-A-Zoo\n    MGANGA (Dr. Eddie Henderson) - Trumpet, Flugelhorn\n    PEPO (Julian Priester) - Bass trombone, Tenor trombone, Alto Trombone, Cowbell\n    MCHEZAJI (Buster Williams) - Electric Bass, Acoustic Bass\n    JABALI (Billy Hart) - Drums\n    Dr. Patrick Gleeson - ARP 2600, ARP Pro Soloist\n    Buck Clarke - Percussion\n\n\ndiscogs ----\n\n\nTracklist\nA1 \tRain Dance \t9:16\nA2 \tHidden Shadows \t10:13\nB \tHornets \t19:36\nCompanies etc\n\n    Phonographic Copyright (p) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CBS Inc.\n    Copyright (c) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CBS Inc.\n    Copyright (c) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hancock Music Company\n    Recorded At Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Different Fur Studios\n    Recorded At Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wally Heider Studios\n\nCredits\n\n    Congas, Bongos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Buck Clarke\n    Drums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jabali (Billy Hart)*\n    Effects [Random Resonator] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fundi (2) (tracks: A1)\n    Electric Bass [Fender Electric Bass With Wah-wah And Fuzz], Double Bass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mchezaji (Buster Williams)*\n    Engineer [Re-mix] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Rubinson\n    Mixed By [Special Monitor Mix] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fundi (2)\n    Mixed By [Synthesizer, Mellotron] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Vieira\n    Painting [Cover] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Robert Springett\n    Piano [Steinway], Electric Piano [Fender Rhodes], Clavinet [Hohner D-6 With Fender Fuzz-wah And Echoples Dakha-di-bello], Mellotron, Handclaps Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mwandishi (Herbie Hancock)*\n    Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Rubinson And Friends Inc.*\n    Recorded By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fred Catero, Jerry Zatkin, John Vieira\n    Soprano Saxophone, Bass Clarinet, Piccolo Flute, Cabasa [Afuche], Kazoo [Hum-a-zoo] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mwile (Benny Maupin)*\n    Synthesizer [Arp 2600, Arp Soloist] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dr. Patrick Gleeson* (tracks: A1)\n    Trombone [Bass, Tenor, Alto], Cowbell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pepo (Julian Priester)*\n    Trumpet, Flugelhorn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mganga (Dr. Eddie Henderson)*\n    Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Herbie Hancock","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:804736ceddaeaac0b0b8a1175ac086e886c089d8","amp;dn":"HERBIE+HANCOCK+sextant-1973-columbia-LP+-Mwandishi-24K+ALAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"804736ceddaeaac0b0b8a1175ac086e886c089d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,71,54,206,221,174,170,192,176,184,161,23,90,192,134,232,134,192,137,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
