Probing the long-term effects of early colonial differences on immigration policy, land distribution, and financial development in a variety of settings, Understanding Long-Run Economic Growth explores the relationship between economic conditions, growth, and inequality, with a focus on how the monopolization of resources by the political elite limits incentives for ordinary people to invest in human capital or technological discovery. Among the topics discussed are the development of credit markets in France, the evolution of transportation companies in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the organization of innovation in the United States.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: National Bureau of Economic Research Conference Report\nPDF: 401 pages\nPublisher: University Of Chicago Press (October 1, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0226116344\nISBN-13: 978-0226116341\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6305861f6903bc48bd73e361e3bc1af328100c4","amp;dn":"Understanding+Long-Run+Economic+Growth%3A+Geography%2C+Institutions%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6305861f6903bc48bd73e361e3bc1af328100c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,48,88,97,246,144,59,196,139,215,62,54,30,59,193,175,50,129,0,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
