There Is a Light That Never Goes Out \n\n\nEighteen singles, eighteen classics; that's pretty much what this disc offers. The Smiths were one of the greatest singles bands of all time, capable of creating striking and emotional songs that were full of pop hooks, well-placed experimental touches, and raw emotion. The singular combination of Johnny Marr's intricate, inescapable guitar lines and the wistful grace of Morrissey's is on full display here. From 1983 to 1987, in an astonishing burst of creativity, The Smiths released these seventeen singles, with B-sides that most bands would die for, and four classic albums.\nThe Smiths were anything but an orthodox rock band, thanks to the acrobatic vocal dynamics of their charismatic lead singer, their unusual song structures, the subjects touched upon in these songs, and above all Morrissey's lyrics.
