But they became too frequent, they became too real. And soon, they began happening down the street. Then the Internet died. The television and radio went silent. The phones stopped ringing. And we couldn't look outside anymore. Malorie raises the children the only way she can; indoors. The house is quiet. The doors are locked, the curtains are closed, mattresses are nailed over the windows. They are out there. She might let them in. The children sleep in the bedroom across the hall. Soon she will have to wake them. Soon she will have to blindfold them. Today they must leave the house. Today they will risk everything.\n\n\n\nBird Box\nBy: Josh Malerman\nFormat: Epub\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 416\nISBN13: 9780062259653\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d44f054efe6b595994d9b255101d7b39394132a9","amp;dn":"Bird+Box+by+Josh+Malerman+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d44f054efe6b595994d9b255101d7b39394132a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,79,5,78,254,107,89,89,148,217,178,85,16,29,123,57,57,65,50,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
