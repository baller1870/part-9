He's aided by Marty Paich's lively, brassy arrangements and an excellent studio band with trumpeter Pete Condoli and saxophonists Herb Geller and Jack Montrose.\n\nA collection of perfect hard-swinging pop with a few ballads thrown in for good measure makes Sings Fred Astaire a masterpiece, one of the best up-tempo vocal albums ever recorded. \n\n\n\nMel TormÃƒÂ©\n\nMel TormÃƒÂ© sings Fred Astaire\n\n1956\n\n\n  CD / 2000 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
