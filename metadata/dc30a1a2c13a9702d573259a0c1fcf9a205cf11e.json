Never afraid to innovate or draw their inspiration from music that traversed the spectrum from symphonic to rock, YES has been at the forefront of progressive rock and became a major force in popular music selling over 30 million albums and reaching platinum status multiple times worldwide. During the late 1960`s YES were renowned for their live performances culminating in their seminal album and film of the same name, YESSONGS. Filmed in 1972 at London`s Rainbow theatre, this feature film was released theatrically in the UK the following. The film features their new line-up of Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Alan White, and having fallen off the radar for nearly forty years and only being available previously in poor quality bootlegs, this official DVD release has been restored by Pinewood Studios Post Production in stunning High-Definition and 5.1 surround sound restoration to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the live Yessongs concert.
