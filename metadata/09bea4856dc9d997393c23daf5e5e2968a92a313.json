Scientist Dr. Charles \nCargraves (Warner Anderson), former Air Force General Thayer (Tom Powers), and \nindustrial tycoon Jim Barnes (John Archer) believe that it&amp;#039;s time that the U.S. \nblazed new trails and found new adventures. Convinced that exploration of space \nis the wave of the future (and that America&amp;#039;s dominance in space is vitally \nimportant if they are to continue to dominate the Earth), the three men begin \nplanning and constructing a spaceship called &quot;Luna&quot; in the Mojave Desert that \nwill take the men to the moon and back. However, anti-American forces begin \nflooding the press with propaganda against the moon mission, and finally the men \nmake their way to moon without the aid of the federal government. While the men \nare thrilled to succeed in their mission, it turns out that they miscalculated \nthe amount of fuel needed to return -- and that the rocket needs to drop a lot \nof weight if it is to return to Earth. Destination Moon won an Academy Award for \nBest Special Effects of 1950; the film also features a brief appearance by \ncartoon favorite Woody Woodpecker, who helps explain how rockets work.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAST\nWarner Anderson        - Dr. Charles Cargraves\nJohn Archer            - Jim Barnes\nTom Powers             - General Thayer\nDick Wesson            - Joe Sweeney\nTed Warde              - Brown\nMichael Miller \t \nErin O&amp;#039;Brien-Moore     - Emily Cargraves \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCREW\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIrving Pichel          - Director\nGeorge Pal             - Producer\nRobert A.

Even the solemn preparations \nfor this unique exploratory trip, though the lesser phase of the adventure, are \nprofoundly impressive to observe. For instance, it is arresting to hear an \neloquent scientist proclaim that the first nation which can use the moon for \nlaunching missiles will control the earth. It is thrilling to be told, in \ndeepest confidence, that this is the greatest miltary fact of our age. And it is \nawesome to watch the mechanics constructing that giant rocket ship.\n\nBut, most of all, it is exciting to climb aboard the ship with those four men \n(two jumps ahead of the sheriff with a stop-order on the whole trip), to wiggle \nand squirm with them in agony as their silver tube roars into space and to join \nin their general amazement at the various phenomena which occur. It is even a \nlittle amusing to watch the inevitable comic character float about in \nnon-gravitational freedom when he becomes a &quot;free orbit,&quot; whatever that means. \nAnd the emergency necessity for the scientists to go outside their ship \n(i???ntheir inter-space suits) to do repair work while the ship is in flight \ncues quite a scene.\n\nAfter the highly perilous landing of the rocket ship on the moon, accomplished \nby turning its nose up and backing in against the pressure of its propelling \njet, the subsequent explorations on the moon are a trifle tame. Nothing to see \nbut old, dead mountains and craters with cracked and scaling sides. There isn&amp;#039;t \na single beautiful female nor even a Russian scientist anywhere, although we&amp;#039;re \nled to be on the lookout for the latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just in case. Indeed, there is no \napparent reason for anyone wanting to settle on the moon, and the picture&amp;#039;s \ndeparture there-from is no particular cause for regret.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the return trip is downhill all the way, despite the \nevident efforts of the scriptwriters to make it hum. For, in tossing away much \nequipment in order to lighten the ship for its take-off from the moon, the \ngentlemen apparently jettisoned what they had left of a script. And the pointed \nsuspension of the adventure in midair is a weak and dull way out.\n\nHowever, that may be reasoned. Apparently Mr. Pal did not want to be \nscientifically liable for returning any voyagers from the moon. Everything else \nhe can argueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the departure, the adventures in space, the look of the moon, even \nthe broadcast that is beamed to the earth from there. And in the performance of \nthese adventures, we can just as well assume that the male cast employed for \nthis picture acts as moon voyagers would. Actually, their human reactions are \nnothing to their gadgeted ship, their miraculous observationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and those are all \nwe advise you go to see.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nscifimoviepage.com\n\nMore sci than fi, this fairly serious 1950ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision of what a moon landing might \nlike be one day has no astronauts being confronted by alien monsters on the moon \nor anything of the sort.\n\nScientifically accurate (for its day) to the 9nth degree, Destination Moon \ninstead boasts astronauts who use too much rocket fuel in landing on the moon \nand then have to get rid of excess weight so as to be able to escape the moonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ngravitational pull again. You can see German rocket expert Hermann Oberth served \nas technical advisor on the film, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not particularly exciting watching a \nbunch of guys in spacesuits dump some oxygen tanks on the surface of the moon to \nbe honest.\n\nMaybe the movie should have stuck more closely to the plot of Rocketship \nGalileo, the juvenile 1947 Robert Heinlein novel on which it is based. In \nHeinleinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original novel three boys and their uncle build a spaceship in their \nbackyard which they use to travel to the moon where they discover Nazis, all of \nwhich is ridiculous of course but sounds much more exciting than dullard \nastronauts sawing rungs off ladders. (Heinlein also contributed to the \nscreenplay along with John OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hanlon and Rip van Ronkel, which unbelievable as it \nsounds is not a complete nom de plume. The authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real name was Alford van \nRonkel.) \n\n&quot;Heinlein&amp;#039;s original novel had Nazis on the moon!&quot;\n\nAccording to this more serious-minded movie the first mission to the moon was to \nbe sponsored by American big businesses because government canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get its act \ntogether. Unknown enemies (commies obviously, but never mentioned by name) would \nconspire to stop the mission from ever happening, trying to sway American public \nopinion against it. The trip itself would be made in an atomic-powered V2 \nrocket. The surface of the moon would have tall mountains and a surface like \nthat of a dry lake bed. As predictive science fiction Destination Moon of course \ngets a lot wrong, and therein most of its interest lies: it is representative of \nwhat people in the 1950s thought a rocket trip to the moon would be like one \nday.\n\nBig business falls in line by the way, because the American military tells them \nthat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe race is on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and we&amp;#039;d better win it, because there is absolutely no \nway to stop an attack from outer space. The first country that can use the Moon \nfor the launching of missiles... will control the Earth. That, gentlemen, is the \nmost important military fact of this century.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn fairness the movie gets a lot right though. There is quite some ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfor \nbeginnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ focus on space travel issues such as weightlessness in space, the \nproperties of vacuum, and the like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all of which makes it about more \nscientifically accurate than 90% of most science fiction movies today. Besides, \nit was produced by George Pal of War of the Worlds and Time Machine fame back \nthen for $586, 000 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a tidy sum back then. Also, its idea of the surface of the \nmoon isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that far off. The special effects are quite good for its time (it \ndeservedly won an Academy award). One can easily imagine Stanley Kubrick having \nwatched it whilst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œresearchingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 2001: A Space Odyssey and saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI can do this \nbetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe movieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest problem though is its plodding pace and nondescript \ncharacters. Only one of the characters is notable from the others, namely the \none played by Dick Wesson, and that is only for his heavy Brooklyn accent and \nannoying folkish demeanour. One almost pictures Vin Diesel having based his \ngrinning buffoon performance in Find Me Guilty on him. Incidentally, in \nDestination Moon the first words to be spoken by the first man on the moon are: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBy the grace of God, and the name of the United States of America, I take \npossession of this planet on behalf of, and for the benefit of, all mankind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ We \nkinda like Neil ArmstrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better . . .\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd you call yourself a scientist, (www.aycyas.com)\n\nOf all the science fiction films of the 1950s that are today acknowledged as \n&quot;classics&quot;, Destination Moon is the least known and most under-appreciated, \nprobably because it offers so little to the casual viewer. Ironically enough, it \nis the very qualities that make this film so important that doom it as \nentertainment: its technical accuracy; its deliberately low-key, almost \ndocumentary approach; and above all its deadly earnestness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ there are no cheap \nthrills here. Sadly, this means that although Destination Moon is a landmark in \nthe development of the science fiction film, and a pioneering work in the true \nsense of the word, it can really only be correctly estimated by the viewer who \napproaches it with some knowledge of its historical importance, and an active \nsense of good will. You will find no aliens, no monsters, no ray-guns, no \nstrange women in leotards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and no &quot;love interest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in Destination Moon; just a \npainstakingly factual account of how mankind might go about building a rocket \nthat would take him to the moon. Despite this (or perhaps because of it: this \nwas, after all, an era when the expression &quot;Popular Science&quot; was not an \noxymoron!), at the time of its first release the film was enormously successful, \ngrossing about ten times its outlay. Those us of living in a time when space \nshuttle flights are so commonplace as to barely rate a mention on the news any \nmore might find it hard to understand what the fuss was all about. To appreciate \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ indeed, to enjoy Destination Moon as it deserves, we must put ourselves in the \nplace of the audiences of the 1950s, first confronted with a concept so radical, \nso outrageous, as a rocket to the moon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and then told that it could really \nhappen. (The film is rightly listed in NASAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official timeline of the history \nof space travel.) Destination Moon was made at a time when humanity stood on the \nbrink of an amazing step forward, and by people who were among the first to \ngrasp that such a thing was possible. While the onscreen action is, \nunfortunately but undeniably, rather stodgy, the production as a whole is \nnevertheless infused with a sense of wonder, of optimism, of simple faith in man \nand what he could achieve. Destination Moon is remarkable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and, looked at from \nthe correct perspective, thrilling  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for being the only space flight film made \nin the heyday of the science fiction film to be truly about space flight. This \nis not a story about being on the moon, but of getting there; the adventure is \nall in the doing.\n\nDestination Moon was the brainchild of writer Robert A. Heinlein and producer \nGeorge Pal, the latter of whom managed to sell a studio on the idea of making a \nserious film about travelling to the moon after the concept was initially \ndismissed as &quot;too fantastic&quot;. (Film studios werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the only ones who thought \nso: in 1948, The American Journal Of Physics published a paper in which the \nauthors explained exactly why a human being could never travel to the moon; \ntheir chief error was assuming that the 4:1 fuel:rocket launch mass ratio of the \nV-2 rocket could not be bettered.) From the start, the project was undertaken \nwith the utmost seriousness. Experts were brought in to ensure its authenticity, \nmost notably Hermann Orbeth, an authority on rockets who had previously worked \nwith Fritz Lang on 1929ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Die Frau Im Mond (the only other &quot;realistic&quot; space \nflight film made to that time), and Chesley Bonestell, the astronomical artist \nwhose glorious paintings and illustrations did so much to bring &quot;outer space&quot; \ninto the collective American consciousness during the late forties and early \nfifties. Together with Pal and Heinlein, these men managed to infuse their other \ncollaborators with their own belief in the realities of space flight, and to \nhave Destination Moon produced under a policy of accuracy above all. The results \nof this mindset are evident throughout the film, which not only illustrates what \nwas known at the time of its production, but is also startlingly prescient about \nthe things that would happen when man finally ventured into space. When the film \nopens, Charles Cargraves and Tom Thayer are intent, not upon the moon, but \nmerely upon putting a satellite into orbit. The failure of the enterprise is a \ncrushing blow to both men ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to Thayer in particular, who has destroyed his \ncareer, &quot;campaigned himself right out of the service&quot;, in pursuit of the \nconquest of space ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but they show themselves to be made of the right stuff, \nsquaring their shoulders and going back to the drawing-board. Two years later, \nthings have changed. When Thayer visits Jim Barnes, he is no longer intent \nmerely upon launching a satellite, but upon being the first to reach the moon \nitself. Barnes is understandably sceptical, but is swayed by the news of \nCargravesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ &quot;atomic engine&quot;, and still more by ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s argument that the mission \nis one of national defence; that whoever reaches the moon first will be able to \nbuild missile bases there. This call to his patriotism, combined with his love \nof scientific pioneering, is enough to convince Jim Barnes, who succeeds in \nrecruiting his fellow industrialists to the cause, arguing that they, and only \nthey, have the resources that the program requires, and that they can get the \njob done in the time it would take the government to finishing debating the \npoint. The moneymen are intrigued but hesitant; and again, it takes ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nexhortations about missile bases on the moon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;There is absolutely no way to \nstop an attack from outer space!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to seal the deal. (Although it erred in \nputting the construction of the rocket into the hands of private industry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a \ndistinctly Heinleinian notion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one of most interesting things about Destination \nMoon is its anticipation of the fact that the main impetus for the space race \nwould ultimately be military, not merely scientific.)\n\nThe film-makersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ commitment to accuracy was laudable, but it presented them with \na substantial difficulty: how to communicate in a comprehendible fashion the \nconcepts on which their story was based, to an audience that (it was assumed) \npossessed little if any knowledge of them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ without turning their entertainment \ninto a lecture on astrophysics. To their credit, the writers avoided one common \npitfall: they do not have Cargraves, Barnes and Thayer telling each other things \nthat they most assuredly already know, in order to convey that information to \nthe audience. However, in avoiding one trap, the writers unfortunately fell into \nanother ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one that makes Destination Moon extremely difficult for a modern \naudience to swallow: scared of talking above their audience, they talked down to \nit instead. The first manifestation of this comes while Barnes and Thayer are \npitching their case to the industrialists. Barnes himself, being in aeronautics, \nhas a grasp of the theories of rockets and space travel; his peers, \nunderstandably, do not. This leads to the most unexpected part of Destination \nMoon: a &quot;training film&quot; starring none other than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Woody Woodpecker! The \nrecalcitrant bird ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the audience, of course ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is given a swift lesson in the \npracticalities of rockets and moon landings; and by the end of it, Woody himself \nis thoroughly convinced, although the industrialists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who, somewhat \nunbelievably, chuckle goodnaturedly all the way through the cartoon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ do require \nmore flag-waving from Thayer before they commit to the project. (In what is \nclearly a step taken to spike the criticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ guns, Woody initially dismisses the \nnotion of a rocket to the moon as &quot;comic-book stuff&quot;. &quot;LIFE Magazine doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t \nthink so!&quot; retorts the narrator, showing him an issue that just happens to carry \na cover story on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the production of Destination Moon! [April 1950, for those \ninterested.]) Now, all of this is amusing, in a kitschy sort of way; but what \nhappens next is not. Having successfully launched their pioneers in their \nrocket, the makers of Destination Moon then felt the need to explain all the \nmysteries of space travel itself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it is here that the film not only becomes \ndifficult to take in its own right, but bestows upon the science fiction films \nthat followed it, apparently in perpetuity, a terrible legacy: the Odious Comic \nReliefÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©. Enter Joe Sweeney, who reluctantly becomes part of the crew when his \nsenior is struck down by appendicitis on the very eve of the mission. Joe (to \nthe surprise of no-one who has suffered torments courtesy of his hideous progeny \nover the ensuing decades) is a blue-collar working joe (get it?), perpetually \nwisecracking, and hailing from, yes, Brooklyn. (He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like space because, \nas he so eloquently puts it, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;no beer, no babes, no baseball!&quot;) JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nlayperson status means that he is ignorant of all aspects of space flight, and \ntherefore must ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ conveniently enough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have everything explained to him. \nUnfortunately, Pal &amp; Co. thoroughly overreached themselves here: so eager were \nthey to ensure that the audience missed nothing, that JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ignorance proves to \nbe of a truly startling magnitude. (At one point, he must even be reminded that, \n&quot;ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no air in outer space!&quot; &quot;ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s room for it!&quot; he replies, \nunconvinced.) It is impossible now to gauge how people reacted to Joe Sweeney in \n1950 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whether they appreciated his presence, or whether they found his \ncharacter a piece of unforgivable condescension, as viewers today are certain to \ndo. In any case, it is difficult to believe that anyone ever found Joe other \nthan unbearably irritating and unfunny ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ although whether this would have been \nthe case had an actor other than Dick Wesson been chosen for the part, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard \nto say. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen Wesson in any other film, so I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know whether his \nrole here reflected his actual persona, or whether he was &quot;acting&quot;. LetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hope \nthe latter. Either way, he is astonishingly annoying; heck, even his teeth are \nannoying! The supreme irony of Destination Moon, of course, is that while its \npainstaking accuracy had no influence whatsoever upon the film-makers that \ncopied it, its single biggest mistake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ viz., Joe Sweeney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ would be unfailingly \nreproduced in almost every science fiction film made during the years that \nfollowed.\n\nIn the end, however, you have to forgive the makers of Destination Moon both Joe \nand Woody, in simple recognition of how much they managed to get right ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and to \npredict. The model rocket that Barnes demonstrates to the industrialists is more \nthan three-quarters &quot;reaction mass&quot;; todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rockets are over 90% fuel. The \nWoody Woodpecker cartoon explains concepts such as overcoming gravity, travel in \na vacuum, reverse thrust, and parachute-assisted landings; while the crew must \ndeal with problems including the effects of G-force (real, but overestimated), \nweightlessness (overcome by magnetic boots), space-sickness, and the difficulty \nof swallowing in zero gravity. Whole scenes envision what would happen when \nmankind did ultimately travel into space. The rocket crew marvels at its view of \nthe Earth, anticipating the staggering images that would be broadcast for the \nfirst time in 1968 by Apollo 8. (The views of the Earth shown are also an \naccurate representation of what anyone travelling in a ship following the same \nflight path as the Luna really would see.) A problem with the shipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aerial \nforces Barnes, Cargraves and Sweeney to don their pressure suits and do an EVA, \nsomething which both the Soviets and the Americans would achieve in 1965. There \nis a problem as the Luna is about to land on the moon, and Barnes must make an \nabrupt readjustment; the Apollo 11 crew would experience a similar difficulty. \nOnce on the moon, Barnes and Cargraves are contacted by radio from the Earth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \nalthough due to the particular framework of the movie, it is the media that \ncontacts them, not the government. Most memorable of all, however, is the moment \nwhen the moon is first &quot;claimed&quot;, an honour that Barnes graciously concedes to \nCargraves. The acting in Destination Moon is rarely better than competent, but \nit reaches its pinnacle here, as Warner AndersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cargraves must speak around a \ndistinct lump in his throat in order, &quot;By the grace of God, and in the name of \nthe United States of America&quot;, to claim the moon &quot;for the benefit of all \nmankind&quot;. (Excluding, we assume, that portion of mankind at whom American \nmissiles would soon be aimed.) The plaque that today rests upon the moonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nsurface reads, &quot;Here men from planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July \n1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind&quot;. You can only wonder how far life \nimitated art.\n\nOf course, it is only natural that Destination Moon wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get everything \nright, and there are a few flubs here and there. The Luna is a single stage \nrocket, and a far cry in its design from the three-stage system that would \nfinally get the job done. (Another instance of &quot;copy the mistake&quot;: almost every \nspace film for the following decade or so would reproduce the sleek, silvery \nlines of the Luna for its own rocket.) It also lands on the moon itself, rather \nthan the ship orbiting, and the crew descending to the moonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s surface in a \nlanding module, as would ultimately be the case. These errors are excusable. \nMore problematic is the simplicity, not to say naivety, with which space travel \nitself is undertaken. When forces on Earth begin to move against the Luna \nproject, attempting to prevent lift-off, Jim Barnes comes up with a startling \nidea: rather than wait a month, as planned, they will exploit the next possible \nlaunch window ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which is only seventeen hours away. &quot;But we havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t had time to \ntrain a crew!&quot; objects Cargraves. &quot;Then weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll go ourselves,&quot; counters Barnes, \nand they do, just like that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ dragging the wholly uninformed and unprepared \nSweeney along with them. And despite all the expert input, there are a few \ndesign flaws in Destination Moon. The worst is the painfully unconvincing &quot;star \nfields&quot; with which the Luna is surrounded at all times. These were actually \nrealised using car headlights ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and unfortunately, it looks like it. The \n&quot;stars&quot;, almost identical in colour and intensity, and closer together than real \nstars ever were, are a major distraction throughout the otherwise well-executed \nEVA sequence. Another mistake, a more surprising one, is Chesley BonestellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ndesign for the surface of the moon, which looks like a huge dried lakebed, all \ndramatic cracks and geometric patterns. Bonestell himself afterwards lamented \nhis error, claiming, not that he could have known what the moon looked like, of \ncourse, but that he could have deduced it. Be this as it may, BonestellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \npaintings are one of the true highlights of Destination Moon, and even if his \nmoonscapes are wrong, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re such a pleasure to look at that we have no trouble \noverlooking the fact.\n\n(Oh, and by the way: IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m perfectly well aware that after my strictures against \nOutland for ignoring facts in order to &quot;look cool&quot;, this sails perilously close \nto hypocrisy. If Outland had gotten as much right as Destination Moon, I would \nhave cut it a little slack, too.)\n\nBy now you might be asking, with all this &quot;science stuff&quot; in Destination Moon, \nis there any story? Well, yes, some ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but not all that much, and what there is, \nis at all times subservient to the film-makersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ commitment to the practical and \nthe possible. The machinations of the rocket projectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enemies on Earth allows \nfor a race against the clock to complete the building of the Luna, and then \nanother race to take off before a threatened court order can be invoked. Once \nthe crew is in space, it is discovered that Sweeney mistakenly greased the \nshipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aerial (time for a lecture, Joe!), which has naturally frozen in place, \nand must be cleaned before it will extend. This leads to the EVA, and to the \nfirst of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two &quot;suspense&quot; sequences. As Barnes and Sweeney are dealing \nwith the aerial, Cargraves moves down the rocket to inspect the engines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and, \nwhen he finds it is not long enough, slips his safety line. (In dramatic terms, \nthat Cargraves would do such a thing is easily the least believable part of the \nstory.) Engrossed in his work, Cargraves does not notice that his magnetic boots \nhave lost contact with the surface of the rocket. The next instant he is \nfloating in space, and it takes some very quick thinking on the part of Barnes \nto resolve the situation. The other dramatic set-piece comes at the climax of \nthe film, when it is discovered that BarnesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ emergency manoeuvring during \nlanding used up too much fuel. Even when everything that can be unloaded from \nthe ship has been, it is still too heavy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ meaning that one of the crew must \nstay behind if the others are to make it back to EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. (Problems involving a \nlack of necessary fuel became a popular plot point in many of the films that \nfollowed Destination Moon. Here, while the method of calculation is accurate, \nthe notion that rocket fuel is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or can be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ calculated down to the single pound \nis less so.) What is interesting about these two sequences is the degree of \ntension that director Irving Pichel managed to generate, given that we know in \nour hearts that nothing bad is going to happen to anyone. Other films may have \nbeen willing to dispose of their space explorers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or at best, to allow them to \nsacrifice themselves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but Destination Moon isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like that: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s far too \noptimistic a work, too certain of manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to rise to any challenge. And \nyet suspense is created. While we know that everything will turn out all right, \nwe donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how: that is where the interest lies. In its details, as well as \nin its conception, Destination Moon is an intellectually enjoyable movie.\n\nScience fiction films may claim to be, intend to be, about &quot;the future&quot;, but \nthey very often say a great deal more about the time in which they were \nproduced; and Destination Moon is no exception. The film is not only a \nfascinating snapshot of the political climate of America in 1950, but is often \nso in wholly unexpected ways. For one thing, the screenplay is amazingly \ncritical of the government ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so much so, that had the film been made by people \nof rather more leftish leanings, it is likely that they would have found \nthemselves summoned for a chat with Senator McCarthy and his colleagues. But \nthere is, of course, a profound philosophical difference between criticising a \ngovernment for being too hawkish, and criticising it for not being hawkish \nenough; and it is the latter of which Destination Moon is guilty. The opening \nsection of the film constantly bemoans WashingtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;peacetime&quot; attitude, \nberating it for cutting appropriations, for not seeing the military necessity of \ncontinuing the rocket program. Furthermore, the screenplay implies, there is a \nspecific reason for this attitudeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.one that Tailgunner Joe himself would have \nheartily applauded. Destination Moon is a Cold War film par excellence, and \nnever more so than in its claim that both the government and the media are \ndeeply infiltrated by enemy agents working to undermine the American Way Of Life \nin general, and the rocket program in particular. Some of the assumptions that \nare made, and the way in which they are made, are nothing short of staggering. \nFor instance, in the opening scene, CargravesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first rocket has barely lifted \noff before it crashes back to earth. Not for a moment does it occur to Cargraves \nthat something could have been wrong in his design or execution; this must be \nsabotage, he claims, and Thayer instantly agrees. (Later we are told that the \nSecret Service &quot;knows&quot; that this was the case.) Having recruited industry to \ntheir cause, Barnes, Cargraves and Thayer get their rocket built, but learn that \ntaking off will be another matter. Cargraves produces a newspaper headlined by a \nstory about mass protests against the launch. &quot;ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not public opinion!&quot; says \nThayer angrily. &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a job of propaganda!&quot; &quot;Manufactured and organised!&quot; agrees \nBarnes. &quot;SomebodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s out to get us!&quot; At no time do they give any indication of \nwhy they think this; it is so, it must be so, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all there is to it. \nSimilarly, when Cargraves must report that their request to test their atomic \nengine has been denied, Barnes is furious, seeing it as one more orchestrated \nbarrier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the inference being, apparently, that no-one could really be concerned \nabout something as trivial as the dispersal of radioactive material. (Given that \nthe time of Destination MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production was also that during which the U.S. \ngovernment commenced its program of secret experiments, in which uninformed \nindividuals, both military and civilian, were deliberately exposed to radiation, \nthese scenes are rather chilling. Nor does &quot;the Commission&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suggestion that \nthe crew shift the atomic engine test to &quot;the South Pacific&quot; make things much \nbetter, given the radiation exposure suffered both by the indigenous population \nand by U.S. servicemen during the atomic testing in the Marshall Islands.) It is \nthen that Barnes comes up with his radical suggestion that they lift off as soon \nas possible. &quot;ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no law against taking off in a spaceship, because no-oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \never done it!&quot; he points out, further arguing that if the three of them ask \npermission, &quot;they&quot; will find another way of stopping them. Sure enough, at the \nlast minute a court order is served, forbidding the take-off (and inferring that \n&quot;they&quot; have infiltrated the court system, as well). The crew-members respond as \nany good Americans would: by evading the order and making a dash for their \nrocket, laughing and jeering at the server from the safety of the elevator. \n(IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve long been fascinated by the ability of Americans to hail their country as \nthe greatest in the world because of its laws and institutions, while \nsimultaneously thumbing their noses at those very laws and institutions, \napparently without any sense of contradiction.) What is most intriguing about \nthese scenes is that &quot;they&quot; are never identified: the word &quot;Communist&quot; is never \nuttered at any point in the film. Then again, in 1950, it was scarcely necessary \nto utter it. (The closest we get is Barnes complaining about &quot;red tape&quot;, which I \ndonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t actually think was intended euphemistically.) It is also remarkable, given \nthe overall tenor of the film, that the technological abilities of this unnamed \nenemy are freely conceded: &quot;they&quot; are not just planning on going to the moon, \nbut capable of getting there; this, a full seven years before the launch of \nSputnik shook the United States out of its sense of complacency, and kicked off \nthe space race in earnest.\n\nDestination Moon is unique in the annals of the science fiction film for the \nclarity and conviction of its vision, and for its refusal to take a single step \noutside the boundaries of what its makers believed to be the truth. Even 2001, \nthat other great &quot;space travel&quot; film, is not so pure. Indeed, the only films \nthat come close to Destination Moon in this respect are two other George Pal \nproductions: Conquest Of Space, which is in every way an inferior creation, and \nWhen Worlds Collide ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ perhaps. (Ah, but whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that on the horizon in the final \nsceneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦?) In one sense, Destination Moon was hugely influential ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;space&quot; films \nflourished for over a decade, until reality began to supersede fantasy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and in \nanother, not influential at all. While other film-makers were quick to jump on \nthe bandwagon, they had little if any interest in imitating their modelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nintegrity. Even the very first copycat film, Rocketship X-M (inspired by the \nmedia coverage of Destination MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production, the makers of this knock-off \nmanaged to get their film written, shot and into the cinemas a month before \nDestination Moon was released!), had its astronauts encountering a group of \nMartians. It is not difficult to see why this would have been the case. \nDestination MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s authenticity really left other film-makers with nowhere to go \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ except into the realm of exploitation. You can just imagine the kind of \nconversation that potential copyists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just for laughs, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s call them &quot;Roger&quot;, \n&quot;Jim&quot; and &quot;Sam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ might have held upon viewing the film:\n\nRoger: ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a pretty good film. I could make it cheaper, though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and it \nwouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take me two years! HmmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.needs something to spice it up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a better \ntitle, for a start---\n\nJim: One thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d look good on a poster. Attack Of The---something-or-other. And \nwe need something to get the kids in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ aliens, or monsters---\n\nSam: Sexy dames, and plenty of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em!\n\nAnd indeed, this is exactly how the space film would evolve ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or degenerate ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \nover the following years. Destination Moon, meanwhile, continued to be the sole \noccupant of the tiny niche it had created for itself, until events in the real \nworld made it redundant. Looking at the film today, it is far easier to see its \nfaults than its virtues. The acting is low-key to the point of invisibility \n(Dick WessonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excepted; if only he were invisible!), and the script so \ndeterminedly matter-of-fact that it sails perilously close to being outright \ndull. Plus, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no sex, and no violence; no aliens, and no monsters; just \npure science, of a kind that today we all take for grantedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. The 1950s were \ntruly the golden era of the science fiction film, and the importance of \nDestination Moon in that context cannot be overestimated. If these days it is a \nstruggle to appreciate the film as it deserves to be appreciated, that in itself \nis a strange kind of compliment. Perhaps the very highest praise offered to \nDestination Moon comes from those who dismiss it as too real to be entertaining. \nThis is a film that, on a certain day in 1969, effectively ceased to be science \nfiction at all.
