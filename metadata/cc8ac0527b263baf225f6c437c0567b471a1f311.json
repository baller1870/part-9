This prolific Tuscon duo (bolstered by a revolving lineup of guest musicians) doesn't make a lot of noise -- songs are driven by solitary snare drums and limply plucked mandolins with occasional trumpet blasts breaking the reverie. This quietness gives Calexico's songs the veneer of a persistent, inexorable fatalism. Even the melodically upbeat ones sucker punch us with solemnity: &quot;Alberto hits his brother on the back of the head/Looks to the north as he starts to get up&quot; goes the opening lyric of &quot;Across the Wire,&quot; one of the cheeriest-sounding tunes. This atmospheric album requires attention for maximum appreciation; without it, you'll graze on the hooky first two tracks, &quot;Sunken Waltz&quot; and &quot;Quattro (World Drifts In)&quot; but snooze through the rest. Give it a chance -- just don't expect a sing-along.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/artists/calexico/albums/album/279521/review/5945711/feast_of_wire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/artists/calexico/albums/album/279521/review/5945711/feast_of_wire&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdd also tracker from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fulldls.com/download-albums-1797-Calexico++Feast+of+Wire+2003.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fulldls.com/download-albums-1797-Calexico++Feast+of+Wire+2003.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8ac0527b263baf225f6c437c0567b471a1f311","amp;dn":"Calexico+-+Feast+of+Wire+2003+%5Bwww.Fulldls.com%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8ac0527b263baf225f6c437c0567b471a1f311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,138,192,82,123,38,59,175,34,95,108,67,124,5,103,180,113,161,243,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
