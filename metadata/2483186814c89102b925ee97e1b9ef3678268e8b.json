PRO #3b.\n\nReview: This is an excellent pro shot video. It includes the only performance of &quot;Beeswax&quot; after 1988, which was substituted for &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; at the last minute after Kurt got upset at the audience for throwing objects at the opening act, Calamity Jane. There are brilliant shots of all 3 members. The picture is clear throughout and is not likely to be higher then 2nd generation. The audio is very good but is a little muffled at times, it is also set to a fairly low volume on the DVD. \n\nPLEASE DO NOT DEGRADE THIS FORMAT OR SELL TO SOME SUCKER ON E-BAY. Enjoy !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2483186814c89102b925ee97e1b9ef3678268e8b","amp;dn":"Nirvana+1992-10-30+Buenos+Aires%2C+Argentina","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2483186814c89102b925ee97e1b9ef3678268e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,131,24,104,20,200,145,2,185,37,238,151,225,185,239,54,120,38,142,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
