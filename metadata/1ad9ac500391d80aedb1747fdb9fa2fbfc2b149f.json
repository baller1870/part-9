He was a writer of considerable influence in the European modernist movement.\n\nCendrars was the first exponent of Modernism in European poetry with his works: The Legend of Novgorode (1907), Les PÃƒÂ¢ques ÃƒÂ  New York (1912), La Prose du TranssibÃƒÂ©rien et la Petite Jehanne de France (1913), SÃƒÂ©quences (1913), La Guerre au Luxembourg (1916), Le Panama ou les aventures de mes sept oncles (1918), J'ai tuÃƒÂ© (1918), and Dix-neuf poÃƒÂ¨mes ÃƒÂ©lastiques (1919). He was the first modernist poet, not only in terms of expressing the fundamental values of Modernism but also in terms of creating its first solid poetical synthesis, although this achievement did not grow out of a literary project or any theoretical considerations but from Cendrars' instinctive attraction to all that was new in the age and equally alive for him in literature of the past.\n\n================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and both are in ePUB format:\n\n* Gold : being the marvellous history of General John Augustus Sutter,translated from the French by Nina Rootes (Marlowe &amp; Company) \n\n* Planus (Autobiography), Edited and translated from the French by Nina Rootes\n\n================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Cendrars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Cendrars&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4388/the-art-of-fiction-no-38-blaise-cendrars&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4388/the-art-of-fiction-no-38-blaise-cendrars&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ad9ac500391d80aedb1747fdb9fa2fbfc2b149f","amp;dn":"Blaise+Cendrars+-+Swiss+Author+%282+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ad9ac500391d80aedb1747fdb9fa2fbfc2b149f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,217,172,80,3,145,216,10,237,177,116,127,219,159,162,251,252,43,20,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
