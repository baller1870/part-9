Bob's backup band and singers are in top form througout. Highlights are many, including &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;, &quot;Rate Race&quot; (surprisingly, perhaps, a tune written by Rita Marley, Bob's wife), &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; and &quot;Rebel Music&quot;. It also contains the better known &quot;Is This Love&quot; and &quot;Jamming&quot;.\n\nIf there is one Bob Marley I would recommend to anyone, this is clearly the one. Furthermore, at 73 min. (originally a double vinyl album), this is the best bang-for-the-buck Marley album. Essential in anyone's CD collection. \n\nby Paul Allaer\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Positive Vibration.wma                                 \n02 - Punky Reggae Party.wma                                 \n03 - Exodus.wma                                             \n04 - Stir It Up.wma                                         \n05 - Rat Race.wma                                           \n06 - Concrete Jungle.wma                                    \n07 - Kinky Reggae.wma                                       \n08 - Lively Up Yourself.wma                                 \n09 - Rebel Music.wma                                        \n10 - War No More Trouble.wma                                \n11 - Is This Love.wma                                       \n12 - Heathen.wma                                            \n13 - Jamming.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2863814c2cefe092d24489207aa4d81788387a22","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+And+The+Wailers+-+Babylon+By+Bus+%281978%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2863814c2cefe092d24489207aa4d81788387a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,99,129,76,44,239,224,146,210,68,137,32,122,164,216,23,136,56,122,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
