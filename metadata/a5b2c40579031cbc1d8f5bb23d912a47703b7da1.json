He is best known as a novelty disco/funk saxophonist, with his biggest hit single being 1972's million seller, &quot;Troglodyte (Cave Man)&quot;.\n\nCastor started as a doo-wop singer in New York. He wrote and recorded &quot;I Promise to Remember&quot; in 1956. Castor then replaced Frankie Lymon in The Teenagers in 1957 before switching to the saxophone in 1960. He had a solo hit with &quot;Hey Leroy, Your Mama's Callin' You&quot; on Smash Records in 1966. Castor also played sax on Dave &quot;Baby&quot; Cortez's hit &quot;Rinky Dink.&quot; He formed the Jimmy Castor Bunch in 1972 and signed with RCA.\n\nAs leader of The Jimmy Castor Bunch in the 1970s, and also as a solo artist, he has released several successful albums and singles. The group reached the peak of their commercial success in 1972 with the release of their album, It's Just Begun, which featured two hit singles: the title track and &quot;Troglodyte (Cave Man),&quot; which was a large hit in the U.S., peaking at #6 in the Billboard Hot 100. The track stayed in the chart for 14 weeks and was a million seller by 30 June 1972, and received a gold disc award from the R.I.A.A.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b2c40579031cbc1d8f5bb23d912a47703b7da1","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Castor+Bunch-It%5C%27s+just+begun-Vinylrip-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b2c40579031cbc1d8f5bb23d912a47703b7da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,178,196,5,121,3,28,188,29,143,91,178,61,145,42,71,112,59,125,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
