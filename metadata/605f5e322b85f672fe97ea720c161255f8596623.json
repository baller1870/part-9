Investigating parallels between our current situation and the rise of dictators and fascism in once-free societies, Wolf uncovers a number of deeply unsettling similarities-from the use of paramilitary groups and secret prisons to the targeted suspension of the rule of law. With this galvanizing call to arms based on her recent book, she urges regular citizens to take back our legacy of freedom and justice. \n\nIn The End of America: A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot, Wolf takes a historical look at the rise of Fascism, outlining the 10 steps necessary for a Fascistic group (or government) to destroy the democratic character of a nation-state and subvert the social/political liberty previously exercised by its citizens:\n\n1) Invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy. \n2) Create secret prisons where torture takes place. \n3) Develop a thug caste or paramilitary force not answerable to citizens. \n4) Set up an internal surveillance system. \n5) Harass citizens' groups. \n6) Engage in arbitrary detention and release. \n7) Target key individuals. \n8) Control the press. \n9) Treat all political dissidents as traitors. \n10) Suspend the rule of law.\n\n\nThe book details how this pattern was implemented in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and elsewhere, and analyzes its emergence and application in American political affairs since the September 11 attacks.\n\n\nNew York Times review:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://movies.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/movies/03end.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://movies.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/movies/03end.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nRun Time: 73 minutes\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605f5e322b85f672fe97ea720c161255f8596623","amp;dn":"The+End+Of+America+%5BAVI+-+Naomi+Wolf+-+Steps+To+Facism%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605f5e322b85f672fe97ea720c161255f8596623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,95,94,50,43,133,246,114,254,151,234,114,12,22,18,85,248,89,102,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
