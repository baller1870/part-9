Fernando (German Jaramillo) is a successful gay writer who was born in MedellÃƒÂ­n, Colombia, but has lived in Europe for the past 30 years. Feeling jaded and uninspired, Fernando decides to return to Colombia after the death of his sister, who was the last surviving member of his immediate family. Fernando remembers the MedellÃƒÂ­n of his youth as a beautiful place, but now the city is the capital of the international drug trade, and crime and urban sprawl have made it a harsh and dangerous place to live. At a party, Fernando meets Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), a member of a teenage street gang. The two soon strike up a friendship, as Fernando tries to show Alexis what's left of the city he once knew, and Alexis teaches Fernando the grim realities of life and death on the streets. Fernando and Alexis become lovers, but despite their affection for each other, Fernando does not fully understand the dangerous and volatile nature of life in the new MedellÃƒÂ­n, which leads him into grave danger. La Virgen de los Sicarios was written for the screen by Fernando Vallejo, based on his novel. Director Barbet Schroeder shot the film on location in MedellÃƒÂ­n, using a digital video camera in order to speed up production in the notoriously dangerous city.\n\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Italian / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587620d5a8c03011c211c5ca707c6f2e955ceb0f","amp;dn":"La+Virgen+de+los+Sicarios+aka+Our+Lady+of+the+Assassins+2000+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587620d5a8c03011c211c5ca707c6f2e955ceb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,118,32,213,168,192,48,17,194,17,197,202,112,124,111,46,149,92,235,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
