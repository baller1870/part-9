YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to combine small, yet powerful, command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your data.\n\nTo get you startedÃ¢â‚¬â€whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on Windows, OS X, or LinuxÃ¢â‚¬â€author Jeroen Janssens introduces the Data Science Toolbox, an easy-to-install virtual environment packed with over 80 command-line tools.\n\nDiscover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible technology. Even if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already comfortable processing data with, say, Python or R, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll greatly improve your data science workflow by also leveraging the power of the command line.\n\n    Obtain data from websites, APIs, databases, and spreadsheets\n    Perform scrub operations on plain text, CSV, HTML/XML, and JSON\n    Explore data, compute descriptive statistics, and create visualizations\n    Manage your data science workflow using Drake\n    Create reusable tools from one-liners and existing Python or R code\n    Parallelize and distribute data-intensive pipelines using GNU Parallel\n    Model data with dimensionality reduction, clustering, regression, and classification algorithms\n\nPublisher: O'Reilly Media; 1 edition (October 12, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1491947853\nISBN-13: 978-1491947852\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAbout the Author\n\nJeroen Janssens is a senior data scientist at YPlan in New York City. His specialties are in machine learning, anomaly detection, and data visualization. Jeroen is passionate about building open source tools for doing data science. He obtained a B.Sc. in Life Sciences and an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, both cum laude from Maastricht University, the Netherlands. Jeroen completed his Ph.D. in Machine Learning at the Tilburg center for Cognition and Communication, Tilburg University. Outside of work, you may find him biking the Brooklyn Bridge, beatboxing, or eating stroopwafels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4305db6819f56c0b0476a14b2186164be5c0eade","amp;dn":"%5BJeroen+Janssens%5DData+Science+at+the+Command+Line+Facing+the+Fut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4305db6819f56c0b0476a14b2186164be5c0eade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,5,219,104,25,245,108,11,4,118,161,75,33,134,22,75,229,192,234,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
