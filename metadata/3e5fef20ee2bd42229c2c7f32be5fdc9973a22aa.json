What begins as a philosophical argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and the struggle for justice in the realm of politics.\n\nIn addition to the debate itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault scholar John Rajchman and includes additional text by Noam Chomsky.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5fef20ee2bd42229c2c7f32be5fdc9973a22aa","amp;dn":"The+Chomsky-Foucault+Debate%3A+On+Human+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5fef20ee2bd42229c2c7f32be5fdc9973a22aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,95,239,32,238,43,212,34,41,194,199,243,43,229,253,201,151,58,34,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
