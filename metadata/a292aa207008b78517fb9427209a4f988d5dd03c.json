During this \r\nshort British tour the band was absolutely on peak form and it can \r\nbe easily heard on this amazing recording. A fury, power and energy \r\nare present on all the tracks. Whole Lotta Love is psychedelic \r\nstand-out and Robert's yelling during theramin battle is thrilling. \r\nCommunication Breakdown is devastating and What Is And What Should \r\nNever Be is one of the most dramatic versions the band ever played. \r\nA real pearl, Traveling Riverside Blues is Zeppelin's bow to the \r\ntalent and magic of Robert Johnson and Plant sings some of his \r\n&quot;lemon&quot; lyrics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a292aa207008b78517fb9427209a4f988d5dd03c","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1969.06.24+London%2C+Maida+Vale+Studio+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a292aa207008b78517fb9427209a4f988d5dd03c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,146,170,32,112,8,183,133,23,251,148,39,32,154,79,152,141,93,208,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
