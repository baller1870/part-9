They recorded their new album live at Bostock&amp;#039;s in\nStephenville, but that&amp;#039;s not all we can look forward to hearing on the album.\n\nThere are six new songs on the track. Two of the new songs were cut during the\nlive performance in Stephenville, while the other four were special tracks\nproduced in the studio. One of those being his current hit single, &quot;Crazy,&quot;\nwhich he co-wrote with his wife Melinda.\n\nDonahew also co-wrote with singer/songwriters Andy Pate and Scott Copeland.\nSome of these songs include &quot;Hunter S&quot; and &quot;Alabama Slammer,&quot; which Donahew said\nis his favorite new song, because of the vibe it gives and its profound lyrics.\nDonahew said he is proud of the new stuff. &quot;The new stuff is definitely some of\nthe better writing that I&amp;#039;ve done,&quot; Donahew said.\n\nWhile Donahew said that his roots in Fort Worth inspired his distinctive\ncombination of classic country and rock and roll, as can be heard in his hit,\n&quot;Stockyards,&quot; he also expressed that his time here in Aggieland has also had a\nbig influence on his career as an artist.\n\n&quot;I have definitely written songs that have had to do with things that have\nhappened here in College Station,&quot; he said. &quot;I draw my songs from life, whether\nit&amp;#039;s what&amp;#039;s going on in my life, where I&amp;#039;m at in my life or who I&amp;#039;m around.&quot;\n\nThe band will also be busy non-stop for the next few months performing and\npromoting their new album in places all over the nation such as New Mexico,\nOklahoma, Missouri, and Kansas, where they have already sold out shows much like\nthey do here in Texas.\n\nIt is clear that this hot band is headed to the top. Wherever the road may take\nthem, they are ready to go there rockin&amp;#039; in style! &quot;As long as people keep\nlistening, we&amp;#039;re gonna keep doing what we do, which is playing, wherever it may\nbe,&quot; Donahew said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a940dba114374b555a974dbf20d7187cc586cbf6","amp;dn":"Casey_Donahew_Band-Live-Raw-Real_In_The_Ville-2008-XXL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a940dba114374b555a974dbf20d7187cc586cbf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,64,219,161,20,55,75,85,90,151,77,191,32,215,24,124,197,134,203,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
