Reflecting the author's personal experiences within communist totalitarianism, this is a book about political passions, radicalism, utopian ideals, and their catastrophic consequences in the twentieth century's experiments in social engineering. Vladimir Tismaneanu brilliantly compares communism and fascism as competing, sometimes overlapping, and occasionally strikingly similar systems of political totalitarianism. He examines the inherent ideological appeal of these radical, revolutionary political movements, the visions of salvation and revolution they pursued, the value and types of charisma of leaders within these political movements, the place of violence within these systems, and their legacies in contemporary politics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f843271f426baa34b4a9a7dd8c9fc0962a2688f0","amp;dn":"The+Devil+in+History%3A+Communism%2C+Fascism%2C+and+Some+Lessons+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f843271f426baa34b4a9a7dd8c9fc0962a2688f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,67,39,31,66,107,170,52,180,169,167,221,140,159,192,150,42,38,136,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
