Band leader Bobby Barth had first picked up a guitar in 1965, encouraged by his father who was already an accomplished player, although Bobby's first interest had been in the drums. \r\n\r\nThe band was notable for being photographed on their first LP all sporting B. C. Rich Guitars, one of the first bands to use them exclusively.\r\n\r\nFollowing Axe with 1980's Living On The Edge the group switched labels to Atco in 1982 for third album Offering, an album that included the hit anthem Rock n' Roll Party In The Streets and a cover of Montrose's I Got The Fire. \r\n\r\nThe album marked the addition of new bassist Wayne Haner to the ranks and AXE got to tour with the likes of the Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne and ZZ Top. The band also played in Britain during 1983 opening for Iron Maiden.\r\n\r\nYear:\t1982\r\n\r\nStyle:\tHard Rock\r\n\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t82.80 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t12/31/2015 \r\nFiles:\t11\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nLength : 0:35:59\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01 - Rock'n'Roll Party In The Streets\r\n02 - Video Inspiration\r\n03 - Steal Another Fantasy\r\n04 - Jennifer\r\n05 - I Got The Fire (Montrose cover)\r\n06 - Burn The City Down\r\n07 - Now Or Never\r\n08 - Holdin' On\r\n09 - Silent Soldiers\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\nBobby Barth - guitar, lead vocals (1979-1984, 1989, 1997-2006)\r\nEdgar Riley, Jr. - keyboards, backing vocals (1979-1984, 1989, 1997-2006)\r\nMike Turpin - bass (1979-1984, 1989)\r\nTeddy Mueller - drums (1979-1984, 1997-2001; died 2012)\r\nMichael Osborne - guitar (1979-1984; died 1984)\r\n\r\nAnd yet more of the Metal/Hard Rock I grew up with","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5314a24ba24e86aa5a60c6630f40c5cab522736f","amp;dn":"+Axe+-+Offering+%28Vinyl+Rip%29+1982+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5314a24ba24e86aa5a60c6630f40c5cab522736f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,20,162,75,162,78,134,170,90,96,198,99,15,64,197,202,181,34,115,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
