Each book of the poem recounts the quest of a knight to achieve a virtue: the Red Crosse Knight of Holinesse, who must slay a dragon and free himself from the witch Duessa; Sir Guyon, Knight of Temperance, who escapes the Cave of Mammon and destroys AcrasiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bowre of Bliss; and the lady-knight Britomart's search for her Sir Artegall, revealed to her in an enchanted mirror.  Although composed as a moral and political allegory, the poem's magical atmosphere captivated the imaginations of later poets from Milton to the Victorians.\n\nAlso included in this collection are Spenser's shorter poems which reveal his generic and stylistic versatility, his remarkable linguistic skill and his mastery of complex metrical forms.  They demonstrate the variety and conflicting personae he adopted: satirist and eulogist, elegist and lover, polemicist and prophet.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* AMORETTI AND EPITHALAMION: A Critical Edition (MRTS, 1997).
