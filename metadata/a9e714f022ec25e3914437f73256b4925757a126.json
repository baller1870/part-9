He perpetuates and revels in his hobo-clown persona, \ncharacterizing himself on Whiskey Icarus as ÃƒÂ´Uncle Barbecue [telling] his \ndum-dum stories,ÃƒÂ¶ or perhaps ÃƒÂ´the wise high-school janitor,ÃƒÂ¶ the type of \ngenial burnout who would name the tracks on his second stand-up album \nafter the songs on KissÃƒâ€  Destroyer, just because. (He did the same thing with \n2010Ãƒâ€ s Death Of The Party, only with Cheap TrickÃƒâ€ s Dream Police.) But the \nmind behind that character is as sharp as they come, capable of sussing out \nthe unexpected angles in an anecdote, as in a tour-de-force bit where he \nbreaks down the multitude of questions raised by his airplane seatmate \ndeciding to bring a Foot Locker shopping bag full of pancakes on board. \n(ÃƒÂ´Pancakes got X-rayed that day!ÃƒÂ¶)\n\nThe other great contradiction of KinaneÃƒâ€ s comedy is his ability to render \nostensibly depressing material playful, and even heartening, via silly details \nand sly wordplay. He turns a lonely, drunken WendyÃƒâ€ s run into a late-night \nheist with an unamused cabbie in the role of getaway driver. He sees his sad \nlife reflected back at him on the face of an unsliced pizza, and soldiers on \nanyway, marveling, ÃƒÂ´This giant taco tastes like Italy!ÃƒÂ¶ And finally, he \nproposes using his own headstone as an opportunity to elicit laughs from \ncemetery passers-by, perhaps the finest distillation of his ability to fuse the \nbleak with the uplifting. KinaneÃƒâ€ s material is frequently self-deprecating, \nsardonic, and debased, but the underlying joy informing his approach gives it \nlife, even when heÃƒâ€ s talking about death. \n\nThe interplay between Kyle Kinane the character and Kyle Kinane the writer is \nwhat makes Whiskey Icarus such a compelling listen. ItÃƒâ€ s full of surprising \nmoments that feel natural, the ramblings of an eccentric who has far more \ncontrol over the situation than he lets on. KinaneÃƒâ€ s lack of self-control is the \ncenterpiece of many of his stories, whether heÃƒâ€ s getting drunk on an airplane, \nmaking a sad meal of 7-Eleven cheeseburger dogs, or pondering whether a \nTwizzler would fit in his butthole; but heÃƒâ€ s extremely savvy in how he portrays \nthese moments, manipulating and stacking them for maximum impact when \nthe punchline falls, turning what could be a one-note character into a power \nchord.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs always, fuck wetmouse and Indoeuro","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9e714f022ec25e3914437f73256b4925757a126","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Kyle+Kinane+-+Whiskey+Icarus+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9e714f022ec25e3914437f73256b4925757a126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,231,20,240,34,236,37,227,145,68,55,247,50,86,180,146,87,87,161,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
