Holst&amp;#039;s personal favorite was &quot;Saturn, The Bringer of Old Age,&quot; a noble tone poem with solemn wind and brass writing. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Yoel Levi shine in this music. This is an excellent orchestra that&amp;#039;s up to the challenges Holst presents in each movement. The Telarc Surround Sound captures every nuance of orchestration brilliantly, making quite an impact in the big orchestral climaxes as well as in the quieter moments. \n\nPreview:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Holst-Planets-Gustav/dp/B000003D2R/ref=sr_1_1/002-1627136-7634445?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1175289533&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Holst-Planets-Gustav/dp/B000003D2R/ref=sr_1_1/002-1627136-7634445?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1175289533&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d2e366c93e20baaae2e6ccd741db9746d7c0c3","amp;dn":"CLASSICAL+-+Gustav+Holst+-+The+Planets%2C+Op.+32+%28Atlanta+SO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d2e366c93e20baaae2e6ccd741db9746d7c0c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,210,227,102,201,62,32,186,170,226,230,204,215,65,219,151,70,215,192,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
