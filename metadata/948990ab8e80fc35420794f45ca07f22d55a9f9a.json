From 1994 until 1998, he was LIFE magazine's staff photographer, the first one in 23 years. His most well known series is the &quot;Faces of Ground Zero&quot; Giant Polaroid Collection, a collection of 246 giant Polaroid portraits shot in the Moby c Studio near Ground Zero in a three-week period shortly after 9/11. A large group of these historic, compelling life-size (9x4&quot;) photos were exhibited in seven cities in 2002, seen by almost a million people. The sale of 55,000 copies of the exhibit book, printed by LIFE, raised over $2 million for the 9/11 relief effort. This collection is considered by many museum and art professionals to be the most significant artistic endeavor to evolve to date from the 9/11 tragedy.\nMcNally is known worldwide for his ability to produce technically and logistically complex assignments with expert use of color and light. He conducts numerous workshops around the world as part of his teaching activities, and is the recipient of numerous awards, including the prestigious Alfred Eisenstadt Award for outstanding magazine photography, as well as Pictures of the Year International, and World Press Photo Foundation Award (awarded first place in Portraits in 1997). Most recently, McNally has been selected as one of 10 photographers worldwide to work on promotion of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nJoe McNally takes you to, what only can be called not the prettiest of locations to teach you just how far a little creative lighting can take your shot... and tell a story. Join him as he uses a lot of different lights in a lot of different ways to tell a story with a beautifully lit, if not so beautiful, ending.\n\nLesson 01 Describing the Scene (3:11)\nLesson 02 Transforming Light Sources (8:55)\nLesson 03 Altering the Mood (6:28)\nLesson 04 Single SB900 Flash (10:22)\nLesson 05 Hard Light (5:51)\nLesson 06 Snapping Away (5:15)\nLesson 07 Lots of Drama (8:39)\nLesson 08 Creepy Color (4:38)\nLesson 09 Crime Scene Shoot (7:45)\nLesson 10 High Speed Synch (5:36)\nLesson 11 Skate Park Shoot (8:35)\nLesson 12 Action Shots (2:57)\nLesson 13 Bits and Pieces (7:48)\n\nTOTAL: 01:26:00\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAdHJAadl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LAdHJAadl&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:948990ab8e80fc35420794f45ca07f22d55a9f9a","amp;dn":"Kelby+Training+-+Creative+Lighting+for+Photographers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"948990ab8e80fc35420794f45ca07f22d55a9f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,137,144,171,142,128,252,53,66,7,148,244,92,160,127,34,213,90,159,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
