Elegant Slumming (1993)\n\nIncluding no less than five British Top Ten singles and several other chart entries stretching back to 1992, Elegant Slumming is easily M People's best album. \nFrom the driving British house of &quot;One Night in Heaven&quot; and the nu-disco slant of &quot;Moving on Up&quot; to more downtempo soul on &quot;Melody of Life,&quot; vocalist Heather Small is confident and aggressive while the production by Mike Pickering and Paul Heard backs her up with an exquisite touch. (AMG) \n\n\nFrom the dance floor to the bedroom, the deep-house diva style of the M People delivers sounds that'll make you surrender to the beat. \nReleased as their first major label outing, Elegant Slumming combines lusty syncopations with liquid-techno vibes that ooze over the top. Throughout the mix, disco grooves, funky bass cuts, piano and bass melodies, wah-wah guitar, and sweet soul vocals ride like a convertible in the neon night. \nThe extravagance is appropriate considering that the British trio was shaking the early-'90s foundation years before ubiquitous house releases were duplicating such soulful jams. \nFor a little history lesson, get ready to jive from the waist down.

Bizarre Fruit (1994)\n\nThe Manchester, England-based trio M People scored in 1994 with a series of British Top Ten hits from its debut album Elegant Slumming; both &quot;Moving on Up&quot; and &quot;One Night in Heaven&quot; became U.S. dance club smashes, thanks to an endearing mixture of house and R&amp;B, and Heather Small's startling vocal presence. \nFortunately, M People did not suffer the dreaded sophomore slump; the 1995 release Bizarre Fruit continues in much the same vein as its predecessor. Bizarre Fruit is chock-full of funky house grooves, and Small's deep, soulful vocals add just the right touch to the mix, making M People considerably warmer than most contemporary dance acts. \nThe &quot;Moving on Up&quot; soundalike &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; was a major club success in its own right. In addition to the obvious dance appeal, &quot;Open Your Heart,&quot; like most of M People's music, has a touch of '70s R&amp;B in the mix. The album's opener, &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes,&quot; has a grandiose gospel-influenced intro before kicking into the funky groove and a melody similar to Technotronic's &quot;Pump Up the Jam.&quot; The jazzy &quot;Search for the Hero,&quot; and the retro-soul tune &quot;Precious Pearl&quot; are also highlights. \nM People, unlike many mid-'90s dance music acts like C+C Music Factory and the Real McCoy, deserves kudos for releasing an album just as entertaining and consistent as its debut. Bizarre Fruit is a worthy follow-up to Elegant Slumming and should please those who enjoy a little soul when hitting the dancefloor.
