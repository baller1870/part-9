Building structural considerations are examined, such as heat loss and gain, windows, and insulation. A thorough discussion of heating and cooling systems basics is provided, along with energy management guidelines. Also covered are energy conservation measures which may be applied for lighting systems, water systems and electrical systems. Specific energy management technologies and their application are discussed in detail, including solar energy systems, energy management systems, and alternative energy technologies.
