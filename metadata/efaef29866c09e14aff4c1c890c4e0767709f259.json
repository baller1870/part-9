His life had been one mishap after          :\n : another.of it. So he should have been prepared for this one... Julian      :\n : Treslove, a professionally unspectacular and disappointed BBC worker, and  :\n : Sam Finkler, a popular Jewish philosopher, writer and television           :\n : personality, are old school friends. Despite a prickly relationship and    :\n : very different lives, they've never quite lost touch with each other - or  :\n : with their former teacher, Libor Sevick, a Czechoslovakian always more     :\n : concerned with the wider world than with exam results. Now, both Libor and :\n : Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and         :\n : unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower,    :\n : they dine at Libor's grand, central London apartment. It's a sweetly       :\n : painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a  :\n : time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered       :\n : children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized    :\n : anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it.                            :\n : Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all       :\n : because that way you had less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough :\n : for the unbearable sadness of both his friends' losses. And it's that very :\n : evening, at exactly 11:30pm, as Treslove hesitates a moment outside the    :\n : window of the oldest violin dealer in the country as he walks home, that he:\n : is attacked. After this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly :\n : and ineluctably change. The Finkler Question is a scorching story of       :\n : exclusion and belonging, justice and love, ageing, wisdom and humanity.    :\n : Funny, furious, unflinching, this extraordinary novel shows one of our     :\n : finest writers at his brilliant best. A staggeringly brilliant new novel   :\n : from bestselling and award-winning giant of literature Howard Jacobson,    :\n : shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize.                                 :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efaef29866c09e14aff4c1c890c4e0767709f259","amp;dn":"Howard+Jacobson+The+Finkler+Question+2010+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efaef29866c09e14aff4c1c890c4e0767709f259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,174,242,152,102,192,158,20,175,244,193,200,144,196,224,118,119,9,242,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
