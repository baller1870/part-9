The crippling siege continues to block access to construction materials desperately needed to rebuild in the wake of the Israeli attack and prevents people from leaving the Strip even for life threatening illnesses.\n\nWith the constant humiliation of living a life punctuated by regular military incursions and ubiquitous checkpoints, Gaza has come to be known as the world's largest open-air prison. Following Israel's naval attack on the Freedom Flotilla-a group of vessels carrying relief supplies and aiming to break the unbearable siege-international observers are increasingly questioning the logic of Israeli military aggression, and worldwide public support for Palestine is growing.\n\nIn Gaza in Crisis, Noam Chomsky and Ilan PappÃƒÂ©, two of the conflict's most insightful critical commentators, survey the fallout from Israel's conduct in Gaza and place it into the context of Israel's longstanding occupation of Palestine. \n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca4b05d1c2439b92a434d03fbc607392257bd99","amp;dn":"Gaza+in+Crisis+-+Noam+Chomsky+%26amp%3B+Ilan+Papp%26eacute%3B+%282010%29+-+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca4b05d1c2439b92a434d03fbc607392257bd99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,164,176,93,28,36,57,185,42,67,77,3,251,198,7,57,34,87,189,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
