With sales of more than two billion copies worldwide, in more than one hundred countries, she had achieved the impossible--more than one book every year since the 1920s, every one a bestseller.\n\nSo prolific was Agatha Christie's output--sixty-six crime novels, twenty plays, six romance novels under a pseudonym and more than one hundred and fifty short stories--it was often claimed that she had a photographic memory. Was this true? Or did she resort over those fifty-five years to more mundane methods of working out her ingenious crimes?\n\nFollowing the death of Agatha's daughter, Rosalind, at the end of 2004, a remarkable legacy was revealed.
