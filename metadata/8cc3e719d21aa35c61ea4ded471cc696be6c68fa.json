High quality and small size.\n\nResearch Methods for Business Students (4th Edition)\nMark Saunders; Adrian Thornhill; Philip Lewis\n\nPublished by Prentice Hall (2006-09-29)\nISBN 10: 0273701487 / ISBN 13: 9780273701484\n\nSynopsis:\nIn this book, Saunders et al address what are perhaps the two biggest problems in teaching Research Methods getting students interested in methodology and theory and helping them to understand the practical relevance. Depth of coverage combined with an accessible style, a real practicality and a straightforward structure result in consistently good student and lecturer feedback. Saunders is an excellent book in terms of both coverage and clarity of expression and this 4th edition will go from strength to strength.\n\nSupport the authors, buy the book if you use it.
