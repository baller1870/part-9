The tour fulfilled its promise of tremendous rock and roll performances on stage. Behind the scenes, the tour embodied debauchery, lewdness and hedonism.\nThe film was shot cinÃƒÂ©ma vÃƒÂ©ritÃƒÂ©, with several cameras with plenty of film left lying around for anyone in the entourage to pick up and start shooting. This allowed the film&amp;#039;s audience to witness backstage parties, drug use, roadie antics, fey artists and the Stones with their defenses down.\n&quot;Cocksucker Blues&quot; was the title of a song Mick Jagger wrote to be the Stones&amp;#039; final single for Decca Records, as per their contract. Its context and language was chosen specifically to anger Decca executives. The track was refused by Decca and only released later on a West German compilation in 1983, although the compilation was discontinued and re-released without the song. [1]\nThe film itself is under a court order which forbids it from being shown unless the director is physically present. This ruling stems from the conflict that arose when the band, which had commissioned the film, decided that its content was inappropriate and didn&amp;#039;t want it shown. The director felt otherwise and thus the ruling. However, bootleg copies of the film are available. It has somewhat of a popular aura surrounding it around fellow rockers, such as Marilyn Manson who mentioned viewing it and seeing his living room in it (parts of it were filmed at the Mary Astor House, on Appian Way in Laurel Canyon where Manson has resided since late 1997).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d94b3073224969f9c26709da1a1a73f7e902f3","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+Cocksucker+Blues+Movie.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d94b3073224969f9c26709da1a1a73f7e902f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,217,75,48,115,34,73,105,249,194,103,9,218,26,26,115,247,233,2,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
