To do that, on the VLC player click &amp;#039;File&amp;#039;, then click &amp;#039;Open Directory&amp;#039; and select the folder &amp;#039;Vuk&amp;#039;. This should take you to the main menu where you can click on &amp;#039;languages&amp;#039; and select English or whichever you like.\n\n\nIf you know how to transfer these files into an .iso file let me know and I&amp;#039;ll do it and then re-upload it as an image file.  If you have any problems feel free to message me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b349de43b4aa497fd7d7b8c1c871b71eaec90b","amp;dn":"Vuk+or+The+Little+Fox+--+animated+Hungarian+movie%2C+multi-languag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b349de43b4aa497fd7d7b8c1c871b71eaec90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,179,73,222,67,180,170,73,127,215,215,184,193,200,113,183,30,174,201,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
