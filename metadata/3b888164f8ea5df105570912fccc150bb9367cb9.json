They soon signed with Capricorn Records and by 1973, had released their first EP, The Marshall Tucker Band.\n\nCompared to Southern rock pioneers and label-mates The Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band had more of a country and western feel, with the flute being a key lead instrument in their sound with a lot of its parts in the higher fife/piccolo register. \\&quot;Can\\&amp;#039;t You See\\&quot;, \\&quot;Fire on the Mountain\\&quot;, and \\&quot;This Ol\\&amp;#039; Cowboy\\&quot; are among their songs that received appreciable FM radio airplay, while \\&quot;Heard It in a Love Song\\&quot; made it to #14 as a single on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977.\n\nSince its inception, the Marshall Tucker Band has suffered three great losses:\n\n* Original frontman and bassist, Tommy Caldwell died from injuries in a jeep crash on April 28, 1980. As well as being the front man who worked the crowd, he also sang background vocals and wrote several songs, including \\&quot;Melody Ann,\\&quot; which was the only song he ever performed lead vocals on.\n\n* His brother, guitarist Toy Caldwell, like Doug Gray also a Vietnam veteran, died of heart disease on February 25, 1993. He was the band\\&amp;#039;s lead guitarist and primary songwriter from 1973 - 1983. He also played steel and acoustic guitar. He used his thumb to pick the strings instead of his other fingers or a pick. He sang lead on several songs, including \\&quot;This Ol Cowboy,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Blue Ridge Mountain Sky.\\&quot; After leaving Marshall Tucker Band, he formed the Toy Caldwell Band and in 1992 released Toy Caldwell Band, his only solo album.\n\n* Founding member, guitarist George McCorkle, died of cancer on June 29, 2007 in Lebanon, Tennessee. He was the band\\&amp;#039;s rhythm guitarist from 1973 - 1983. He also wrote many of the band\\&amp;#039;s songs including \\&quot;Fire on the Mountain,\\&quot; \\&quot;Silverado,\\&quot; \\&quot;Last of the Singing Cowboys,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Holdin\\&amp;#039; On To You.\\&quot; In 1999 he released his first solo CD, American Street.\n\nDespite these losses, the Marshall Tucker Band still plays up to 150 shows in a year, and are set to release their new album in June of 2007 entitled \\&quot;The Next Adventure\\&quot; on Ramblin Records. Lead singer Doug Gray is the only original member in the current (2007) lineup.\n\nBand name origin\n\nThere was no band member named \\&quot;Marshall Tucker\\&quot;. Originally, the band called itself The Toy Factory (named after lead-guitarist Toy Caldwell). But by the time the band released its first album they had become the Marshall Tucker Band. During a radio interview in Hempstead, New York, in 1973, Tommy Caldwell explained the origins of the band\\&amp;#039;s name:\n\nThere\\&amp;#039;s an old blind dude [in Spartanburg] that tunes pianos, and his name is Marshall Tucker... We didn\\&amp;#039;t name the band after him, but we just kind of liked that name and stuck with it.\n\nThe band\\&amp;#039;s official website offers additional background:\n\nWhen MTB first got together in their native Spartanburg back in 1972 they were rehearsing in an old warehouse. They had yet to decide on a name and were discussing what they should call themselves one evening. Someone looked at the tag on the key and it said \\&quot;Marshall Tucker\\&quot; and it was suggested they call themselves the Marshall Tucker Band, not knowing it was a real person\\&amp;#039;s name. Because it was time to go to dinner and everyone was hungry they said \\&quot;sounds great\\&quot; and the rest is history. A few years later they found out that Marshall Tucker was the name of the person who rented the building before them. His name was still on the key tag because the warehouse owner hadn\\&amp;#039;t changed it yet. Mr. Tucker was a blind piano tuner, who, along with his partner, used the building for their piano business.\n\n\nThe Marshall Tucker Band is the self-titled debut album by The Marshall Tucker Band, a groundbreaking Southern Rock band. It was recorded in 1973 in Macon, Georgia at Capricorn Studios. The album contains some of the best songs of the Southern Rock genre, such as \\&quot;Can\\&amp;#039;t You See\\&quot;, \\&quot;Take the Highway\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ramblin\\&amp;#039;\\&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. \\&quot;Take the Highway\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 6:15\n2. \\&quot;Can\\&amp;#039;t You See\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 6:05\n3. \\&quot;Losing You\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 5:10\n4. \\&quot;Hillbilly Band\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 2:35\n5. \\&quot;See You Later, I\\&amp;#039;m Gone\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 3:08\n6. \\&quot;Ramblin\\&amp;#039;\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 5:07\n7. \\&quot;My Jesus Told Me So\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 5:32\n8. \\&quot;AB\\&amp;#039;s Song\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 1:15\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Toy Caldwell - guitar, steel guitar, vocals\n* Tommy Caldwell - bass, vocals\n* Doug Gray - lead vocals\n* George McCorkle - guitar\n* Paul Riddle - drums\n* Jerry Eubanks - flute, saxophone, vocals\n\nWhere We All Belong is the third album by The Marshall Tucker Band. It is a double album; Album One is a studio album and Album Two is a live album, featuring extensive jamming by the band and guest fiddle player, Charlie Daniels, on \\&quot;24 Hours At A Time.\\&quot; Album One was recorded in 1974 in Macon, Georgia at Capricorn Studios. There are several guest artists that contributed to seven songs recorded in the studio: Elvin Bishop - slide guitar on \\&quot;Where a Country Boy Belongs;\\&quot; Charlie Daniels - fiddle; Earl Ford - trombone; Paul Hornsby, piano, organ and clavinet; Jerry Joseph - conga; Steve Madaio - trumpet; Sam McPhearson - harp; Andy Stein - fiddle; and Johnny Vernazza - slide guitar on \\&quot;Where a Country Boy Belongs.\n\nBecause this is a double album, disc one is side one and side four and disc two is side two and side three. The reason for this is so that the records may be played in order on those phonograph players that are capable of playing multiple records.\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide One\n\n1. \\&quot;This Ol\\&amp;#039; Cowboy\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 6:42\n2. \\&quot;Low Down Ways\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 2:57\n3. \\&quot;In My Own Way\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 7:17\n\nSide Two\n\n1. \\&quot;How Can I Slow Down\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 3:19\n2. \\&quot;Where A Country Boy Belongs\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 4:32\n3. \\&quot;Now She\\&amp;#039;s Gone\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell &amp; Tommy Caldwell) - 4:20\n4. \\&quot;Try One More Time\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 4:46\n\n\nTrack listing, (live)\nSide Three\n\n1. \\&quot;Ramblin\\&amp;#039;\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 5:35\n2. \\&quot;24 Hours At A Time\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 13:17\n\nSide Four\n\n1. \\&quot;Everyday (I Have The Blues)\\&quot; (Peter Chapman) - 11:30\n2. \\&quot;Take The Highway\\&quot; (Toy Caldwell) - 6:56\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Toy Caldwell - Electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitar and vocals\n* Tommy Caldwell - Bass guitar and background vocals\n* George McCorkle - Electric and acoustic guitars, banjo\n* Jerry Eubanks - Flute, alto, baratone and tenor saxophone, background vocals\n* Doug Gray - Lead vocals and percussion\n* Paul Riddle - drums\n\nSearchin\\&amp;#039; for a Rainbow is the 4th studio album by The Marshall Tucker Band.
