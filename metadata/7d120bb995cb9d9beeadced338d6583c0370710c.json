But they all left floored and this LP is the document of that set. It is difficult to believe that, with players so young (and having been together under a year), Lloyd was able to muster a progressive jazz that was so far-reaching and so undeniably sophisticated, yet so rich and accessible . . .\n\n\nCHARLES  LLOYD\n\nAt Monterey\n\nFOREST  FLOWER     1967\n\n\n- CD\n- 2005\n- Remastered\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nRecorded on September 18, 1966 in Monterey, CA (# 1, 2 &amp; 5) and on September 8, 1966 in New York (# 3 &amp; 4)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d120bb995cb9d9beeadced338d6583c0370710c","amp;dn":"Charles+Lloyd+at+Monterey+-+Forest+Flower+1967+-+Remastered+-+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d120bb995cb9d9beeadced338d6583c0370710c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,18,11,185,149,203,157,155,238,173,206,211,56,214,88,60,3,112,113,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
