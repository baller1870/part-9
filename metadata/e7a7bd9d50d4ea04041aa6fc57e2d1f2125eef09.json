These self-extracting Zip files are ideal for electronic file distribution, because they contain multiple compressed files, minimizing download time and ensuring that important files do not become separated.\n\nAdditionally, WinZip Self-Extractor allows the recipient to use a familiar Windows interface to decompress files without a separate unzip utility.\n\nSelf-extracting Zip files can optionally run a &quot;setup&quot; or &quot;installation&quot; program, provided by the creator, after the files are decompressed.\n\nWinZip Self-Extractor 4.0 is a companion product to WinZip and is separately licensed. The current release of WinZip contains WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition, a subset of WinZip Self-Extractor 4.0. For a comparison between WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition and WinZip Self-Extractor 4.0, click here.\n\nKey Features:\n\nNew\tSupport for Jpeg Compression \nCreate self-extracting Zip files that contain files compressed with Jpeg compression, delivering up to 25% compression of JPEG images with no loss in quality\n\nNew\tSupport for LZMA Compression \nCreate self-extracting Zip files that contain files compressed with LZMA compression, delivering powerful compression for many file types\n\nNew\tSupport for WavPack Compression \nCreate self-extracting Zip files that contain files compressed with WavPack compression, delivering lossless compression of .WAV (audio) files\n\nNew\tSupport for Zipx files \nCreate self-extracting Zip files from .zipx files that are compressed with advanced compression technology.\n\nNew\tUnicode Support \nTo ensure international characters are displayed for filenames in a Zip file\n\nSupport for Advanced Compression methods \nSupports PPMd and Enhanced Deflate compressed files\n\nIcon Support \nWinZip Self-Extractor supports icon sizes of 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 96x96, 128x128, and 256x256.
