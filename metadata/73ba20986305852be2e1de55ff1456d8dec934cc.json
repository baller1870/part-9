Beginning more than 20,000 years ago with Cro-Magnon cave dwellers on Gibraltar and stretching to the present, Abulafia treats the Great Sea as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Liquid Continent,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a place peopled and traveledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½where trade, cultural exchange, and empire-building were forces as key to life as currents, tides, and weather patterns. The book deftly illustrates how the Mediterranean was always big enough to keep cultures apart, thus allowing them the space to flourish as unique entities, but that it was never so big that differing cultures couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t interact. The result is an epic story of trade and conflict, showing how differences in language, religion, law, and other human flashpoints sparked so much of what we think of today simply as culture. --Chris Schluep\nAnother for the history collection.
