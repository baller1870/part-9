Burrough's fascination with his subject matter stems from a family connectionÃ¢â‚¬â€his paternal grandfather manned a roadblock in Arkansas during the hunt for Bonnie and ClydeÃ¢â‚¬â€and he successfully translates years of dogged research, which included thorough review of recently disclosed FBI files, into a graceful narrative. This true crime history appropriately balances violent shootouts and schemes for daring prison breaks with a detailed account of how the slew of robberies and headlines helped an ambitious federal bureaucrat named J. Edgar Hoover transform a small agency into the FBI we know today. While some of the details (e.g., that Dillinger got a traffic ticket) are trivial, this book compellingly brings back to life people and times distorted in the popular imagination by hagiographic bureau memoirs and Hollywood. Burrough's recent New York Times op-ed piece drawing parallels between the bureau's &quot;reinvention&quot; in the 1930s and today's reform efforts to combat the war on terror will help attract readers looking for lessons from history. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Public-Enemies-Americas-Greatest-1933-34/dp/0143115863/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347212897&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=public+enemies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Public-Enemies-Americas-Greatest-1933-34/dp/0143115863/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347212897&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=public+enemies&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4833cf8a42c82b9e1387fee91a40f8f3221389ea","amp;dn":"Public+Enemies+%28EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4833cf8a42c82b9e1387fee91a40f8f3221389ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,51,207,138,66,200,43,158,19,135,254,233,26,64,248,243,34,19,137,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
