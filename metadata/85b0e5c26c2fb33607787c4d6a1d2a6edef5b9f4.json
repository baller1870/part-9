Using Universe Sandbox, one can see the effects of gravity on objects in the universe and run scale simulations of our Solar System, various galaxies or other simulations, while at the same time, interacting and maintaining control over gravity, time, and other objects in the universe (moons, planets, asteroids, comets, black holes, etc.)\n\nFeatures:\n\nInteractive n-body gravity simulator\nSimple tutorial introduction\nSeveral step-by-step activities included\nAll units are measured in real units: kilograms, meters, seconds, etc.\nUser control of the speed of time, gravity and other factors\nSimulation files are editable\n3D Mode for use with red &amp; cyan 3D glasses (anaglyph stereoscopic)\nSupport for 3D DLP HD televisions\nMultiple color modes to help visualize and differentiate speeds and accelerations\nTwo collision modes, Bounce and Combine\nScaled ring systems of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, and generate rings around bodies\nParticle grids can be used to create 2D computer graphics or 3D computer graphics particle grids and then you warp/distort the grids and watch the gravitational effects by adding in moving planets or other objects (not in version 2)\n&quot;Line-up/chart&quot; mode option shows a visual size comparison of the stars and planets\nIncludes the full sky panoramic view of the Milky Way from Axel Mellinger's photography of the Milky Way\nCan capture high resolution screen shots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b0e5c26c2fb33607787c4d6a1d2a6edef5b9f4","amp;dn":"Universe+Sandbox%5BAnthraX2112%5D%5BNo+rars%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b0e5c26c2fb33607787c4d6a1d2a6edef5b9f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,176,229,194,108,47,179,54,7,120,124,77,106,29,42,110,222,245,185,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
