This is arguably the band's tightest, most concentrated venture, but there's still plenty of raw rock energy at work. &quot;It's our most metal and most folk oriented record so far,&quot; McBean says. &quot;I'm not gonna say it's our best record or the album that we always dreamt of making 'cause that's what everyone says. It's all about where we were at the time the machines were rolling. You can't control the electricity or how your limbs were moving that day. You have to erase the visions and just go along for the ride.&quot;\n\nA little over a year after releasing In The Future, their critically and commercially celebrated sophomore effort, Black Mountain started building Wilderness Heart on the west coast of America. With Randall Dunn at the helm (Sunn O))), Boris), London Bridge Studios in Seattle saw a portion of the construction with songs &quot;Old Fangs,&quot; &quot;Let Spirits Ride,&quot; and title track &quot;Wilderness Heart&quot; among others. The preponderance of recording was held with D. Sardy in Los Angeles at Sunset Sound, which has captured tracks from The Doors, Ringo Starr, the Rolling Stones, and more. L.A. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with its tacos and sunsets, starlets and hills and post-Deco kitsch ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was a considerable inspiration. &quot;Just being under the influence of one's surroundings, as we were while recording in L.A., had a tremendous impact on the process and the way we play. Consequently, the LA sessions have a free and summery vibe. The Seattle sessions, made in the grey, rainy environs that we're used to up there, have a chillier, more claustrophobic feeling,&quot; Wells explains.\n\n&quot;It's a Black Mountain pop record, which is to say it's nothing like pop at all,&quot; Wells says. &quot;This was the fastest record we've ever made. We're used to spending a lot of time deliberating over the songs and spacing out recording sessions over years. Start to finish, this album was made in four months, which is something like a miracle for us. We've never worked with producers before and that was a challenge; for us to let go and let two outsiders into the process, D. Sardy and Randall Dunn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it took some growing for us to be truly open, but this album is all the better for it.&quot;\n\nThe band cites a slew of disparate influences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ New Order, King Crimson, Studio 54, Alex Chilton, sunshine, Janis Joplin, Please Kill Me, Shirley Collins, Mickey Newbury, jalapeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o salsa, Night of The Hunter, Cactus Taqueria, Funky16Corners podcasts, Dennis Wilson, the house blowing up in the desert at the end of Zabriskie Point ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but, as Schmidt points out, &quot;Who knows how these things connect with the holistic mix of often dissonant forces that become Black Mountain?&quot;\n\nIndeed: Listen and find out.  \n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc141866194e3207d53625e397438bdda3ecf90","amp;dn":"%28Alternative+Rock%29+Black+Mountain+-+Wilderness+Heart+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc141866194e3207d53625e397438bdda3ecf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,193,65,134,97,148,227,32,125,83,98,94,57,116,56,189,218,62,207,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
