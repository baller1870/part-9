The theory of directed energy weapons used to take down the twin towers is still interesting, but the jury is still out...of course. ;)\n\n\nEpisode Title: Death Ray\n\n\nVideo: Xvid 640x352 29.97fps 1021kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 96kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341f3d1d2db5eb300b753a07d8c13accce89ba61","amp;dn":"Conspiracy.Theory.with.Jesse.Ventura.S03E02.HDTV.XviD-BiLDeRBeRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341f3d1d2db5eb300b753a07d8c13accce89ba61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,31,61,29,45,181,235,48,11,117,58,7,216,193,58,204,206,137,186,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
