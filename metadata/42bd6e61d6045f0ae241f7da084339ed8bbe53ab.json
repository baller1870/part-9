He spends a lot of time working late at night, eating and sleeping alone, and even more time meandering around his neighborhood staring into the darkened windows of shops. One night when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feeling really low, he wanders by a beautiful little bakery with the lights still on. The baker invites him in, and some time during that night Tristan realizes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the first time heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really smiled in months.\n\nHenry Livingston has always been the odd duck, the black sheep, the baker in an old money family where pedigree is everything and quirky personalities are hidden behind dry martinis and thick upper east side townhouse facades. Henry is drawn to TristanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy country charm, dry English wit, and everything that is so different from HenryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world.\n\nTheir new romance is all buttercream frosting and sugared violets until Tristan's need to fit in at work makes him do something he desperately wishes he could undo. Tristan has to prove to Henry that he can be trusted again before they can indulge in the sweet stuff they're both craving","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42bd6e61d6045f0ae241f7da084339ed8bbe53ab","amp;dn":"Macarons+at+Midnight+-+M.J.+O%27Shea+%26amp%3B+Anna+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42bd6e61d6045f0ae241f7da084339ed8bbe53ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,189,110,97,214,4,95,10,226,65,247,218,8,67,57,237,139,190,83,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
