But then he wakes. He is naked, thirsty, starving. But alive. How is that possible? He remembers dying, his bones breaking, his skull dashed upon the rocks. So how is he here? And where is this place? It looks like the suburban English town where he lived as a child, before an unthinkable tragedy happened and his family moved to America. But the neighborhood around his old house is overgrown, covered in dust, and completely abandoned. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on? And why is it that whenever he closes his eyes, he falls prey to vivid, agonizing memories that seem more real than the world around him? Seth begins a search for answers, hoping that he might not be alone, that this might not be the hell he fears it to be, that there might be more than just this. . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d96faedba39e851d3b3b48d985180356465dc3","amp;dn":"More+Than+This+by+Patrick+Ness+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d96faedba39e851d3b3b48d985180356465dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,217,111,174,219,163,158,133,29,59,59,72,217,133,24,3,86,70,93,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
