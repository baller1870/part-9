They also catch up with friends and relatives to see what great home cooks produce to feed their families. As the bikers go on their freewheeling trip through Europe, they stop to cook their own dishes, inspired by the country they're visiting and the local ingredients they discover. It's the journey of a lifetime and there's a fair bit of madness thrown in as they find plenty of time to party at the locals' festivities and cultural events as well as taking in must-see sights and activities. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hairybikers.com/shows/bakeation/1478#qdYmVj7lUmjdDJ6T.97&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hairybikers.com/shows/bakeation/1478#qdYmVj7lUmjdDJ6T.97&lt;/a&gt;\n\nghost dog...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58739433247277f2fb4397dc94067d1a5ef038c3","amp;dn":"The+Hairy+Bikers%27+Bakeation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58739433247277f2fb4397dc94067d1a5ef038c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,115,148,51,36,114,119,242,251,67,151,220,148,6,125,26,94,240,56,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
