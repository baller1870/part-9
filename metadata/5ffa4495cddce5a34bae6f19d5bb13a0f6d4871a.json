Over 25TB of data.\n \nPlease read the article for more details.\n********************************\nLibGen is the world's largest open, online library of scientific and technical knowledge (and much much more). \n \nKAT is the world's largest online torrenting community.\n \nBoth are full of smart, knowledgable, good-hearted, idealistic people.\n \nLet's show our support for the work of the good people at libgen by making sure their torrents stay strong and healthy.\n \nWhen asked &quot;how can I help&quot;, Bookwarrior of LibGen repeatedly says &quot;Put up mirrors. If you can't put up mirrors, download and seed the content. If you can't do all of it, do some of it. If you can't seed it, then at least store it offline in case of a disaster.&quot; \n********************************\n \nAgain, this is a torrent of torrents -- usually forbidden -- but I hope that considering the exceptional nature of this torrent (and the huge size of the content), the rules can be bent a little.\n\nThis is LibGen's official distribution. &lt;a href=&quot;\nftp://libgen.in/scimag_torrent/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nftp://libgen.in/scimag_torrent/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe overall collection is split into archives of 1000 files each.\nEach torrent in this bundle contains 100 such archives.\nThat means each torrent in this bundle contains 100,000 files.\nThere are 350 torrent here -- making 35,000,000 files.\n \nAs with the main LibGen repository, this one also has an associated database of metadata. &lt;a href=&quot;\nftp://ftp.libgen.in/dbdumps/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nftp://ftp.libgen.in/dbdumps/&lt;/a&gt;\n \nOnce again, the data itself is not readily accessible without the metadata database and a front end.\n \nFortunately, karl_karlsson has once again created a portable version that requires no installation. (It does require set up.) \nhere's a google translate version of the page: https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?act=url&amp;depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://genofond.org/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D31510&amp;usg=ALkJrhgwVUB3BO9Yk10UCrhE4IKejlwYTg#p31510\nThe original in Russian: http://genofond.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=607\n \nThis time, the filenames are not the MD5 of the file.\nThis time they use something called the DOI (Digital Object Identifier). This is the way the files came, unaltered by the good people at libgen. (Look it up in Wikipedia. DOI looks bad to me).\n \nA link to the front-end can be found here. (I have a problem with the CSS, but the search etc works fine). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genofond.org/viewtopic.php?p=59793#p59793&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genofond.org/viewtopic.php?p=59793#p59793&lt;/a&gt;\n \nIf this torrent is allowed to survive, I'll be happy to try to help anyone who has questions about working with this -- but be warned, I'm learning too. Maybe I'm just a step or two ahead. Maybe I'll have to look for answers.
