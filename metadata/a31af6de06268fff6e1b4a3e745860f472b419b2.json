Freeh - My FBI - Bringing Down the Mafia, Investigating Bill Clinton, and Fighting the War on Terror\r\n\r\nLouis Freeh led the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1993 to 2001, through some of the most tumultuous times in its long history. This is the story of a life in law enforcement, and of one manâ€™s determined struggle to strengthen and reform the FBI while ensuring its freedom from political interference.\r\n\r\nBill Clinton called Freeh a â€œlaw enforcement legendâ€ when he nominated him as FBI Director. The good feelings would not last. Going toe-to-toe with his boss during the scandal-plagued â€˜90s, Freeh fought hard to defend his agency from political interference and to protect America from the growing threat of international terrorism. When Clinton later called that appointment the worst one he had made as president, Freeh considered it â€œa badge of honor.â€ \r\n\r\nThis is Freehâ€™s entire story, from his Catholic upbringing in New \r\nJersey to law school, the FBI training academy, his career as a US District attorney and as a federal judge, and finally his eight years as the nationâ€™s top cop. This is the definitive account of American law enforcement in the run-up to September 11. Freeh is clear-eyed, frank, the ultimate realist, and he offers resolute vision for the struggles ahead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a31af6de06268fff6e1b4a3e745860f472b419b2","amp;dn":"Louis+J.+Freeh+-+My+FBI+-+Bringing+Down+the+Mafia%2C+Investigating","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a31af6de06268fff6e1b4a3e745860f472b419b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,26,246,222,6,38,143,255,110,27,74,62,116,88,96,244,114,180,25,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
