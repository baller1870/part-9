Many classic stories are redone in a coherent and definitive manner, along with plenty of cameos from friends and family. In light of Ed Brubaker's epic run, the parts with Captain America and Bucky are particularly illuminating. This copy of the miniseries is Digital, all thanks to TheHand-Empire for their awesome work. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f7afeb527b223472c8cfa536bbb8f2afca1729","amp;dn":"Captain+America+-+Man+Out+Of+Time+01-05+%282011%7CDigital%7CTheHand-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f7afeb527b223472c8cfa536bbb8f2afca1729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,247,175,235,82,123,34,52,114,200,207,165,54,187,184,242,175,202,23,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
