In any case, there is a vindictive, accusatory tone to songs such as &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; and &quot;Poles Apart,&quot; and the overarching theme, from the album title to the graphics to the &quot;I-you&quot; pronouns in most of the lyrics, has to do with dichotomies and distinctions, with &quot;I&quot; always having the upper hand. Musically, Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Wright have largely turned the clock back to the pre-Dark Side of the Moon Floyd, with slow tempos, sustained keyboard chords, and guitar solos with a lot of echo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3c70e29fb345de1c4a46d9ca9a8d177538b329","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+The+Division+Bell+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3c70e29fb345de1c4a46d9ca9a8d177538b329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,60,112,226,159,179,69,222,28,74,70,217,202,154,141,23,117,56,179,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
