Ooops.\n\nThis should be all the files you need to play multiplayer; the source I had for this has since taken the file down so I am mostly working from memory. Follow the directions listed below:\n\n1. Install EU4 (I recommend FTL's release).\n2. Install patch 1.1.1 (FTLDOX)\n3. Install patch 1.2.1 (3DM)\n4. Install the files provided in this torrent. (RTVFiX)\n5. Create a Steam account (a new one, if you already have one; use fake info).\n6. Run Steam and login with your fake account.\n7. Play (Hamachi and Tunngle both work).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e4123480b1a2f01a1df328e6abf288448458d53","amp;dn":"Europa+Universalis+IV+-+MP+Patch+%5BRTVFiX%5D+%5BProper%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e4123480b1a2f01a1df328e6abf288448458d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,65,35,72,11,26,47,1,161,223,50,142,106,191,40,132,72,69,141,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
