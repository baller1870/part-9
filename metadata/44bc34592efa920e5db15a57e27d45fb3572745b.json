Mythology brings together the best-loved comic characters in the world, brought to life by one of the most astonishing young artists working in the medium today, Alex Ross. The award-winning designer/writer Chip Kidd and photographer Geoff Spear have teamed up to create a book like no other, with an introduction by M. Night Shyamalan, the acclaimed director of Signs and The Sixth Sense.\n\nRoss has often been called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe Norman Rockwell of comics,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and this book reveals not only his lifelong love of these classic super heroes but also his vision: Mythology takes you into the studio for a behind-the-scenes look at his fascinating creative process. The combination of RossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dynamic art and KiddÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kinetic design make images from his most memorable storiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“including Kingdom Come, Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War on Crime, and Uncle SamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“soar off the more than 280 pages. There are also hundreds of never-before-seen sketches, limited edition prints, and prototype sculptures. Vintage DC comic panels are interspersed throughout, as reference points from which Ross launches his extraordinary interpretations.\n\nAnd most exciting for Ross fans, inside is a DC Comics first: an exclusive, original Superman-Batman story, written by Kidd and painted by Ross. Also included is an all-new origin of Robin, written by Paul Dini. Mythology is a book in which every page explodes with the power of the icons it celebrates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44bc34592efa920e5db15a57e27d45fb3572745b","amp;dn":"Mythology+The+DC+Comics+Art+of+Alex+Ross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44bc34592efa920e5db15a57e27d45fb3572745b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,188,52,89,46,250,146,14,93,177,90,87,226,125,69,251,53,114,116,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
