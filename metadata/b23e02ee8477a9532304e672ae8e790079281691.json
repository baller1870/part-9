Once again, he wisely tipped The Dust\nBrothers (notorious producers of classic albums including Beastie\nBoy's Paul's Boutique and Beck's own Grammy award winning album--\nOdelay) to produce this latest album entitled, Guero. The result\nis a long-awaited return to his catchy hip-hop, slide-guitar\nblues, and funk influenced sound, found in classic tracks like\n&amp;quot;Loser&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Where It's At.&amp;quot;\n\nA melded tracklist, &amp;quot;E-Pro&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Que' Onda Guero&amp;quot; sound like\nsomething you'd find off a Beastie Boys or Cypress Hill album.\nJack White makes an appearance playing bass on the song &amp;quot;Go It\nAlone,&amp;quot; and Beck unleashes a funky guitar synth on &amp;quot;Earthquake\nWeather,&amp;quot; reminiscent of the classic Isley Brother's hit song\n&amp;quot;Who's That Lady?&amp;quot;\n\nWith this latest creation, Beck delivers yet another genre defying\ncollection of uniquely inspired songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23e02ee8477a9532304e672ae8e790079281691","amp;dn":"Beck-Guero-%28Retail%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23e02ee8477a9532304e672ae8e790079281691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,62,2,238,132,119,169,83,35,4,230,114,174,142,121,0,121,40,22,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
