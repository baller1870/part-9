Zzzz\n\n* ABOUT *\n\nCofounded in Australia in the early &amp;#039;80s by Irish punk bassist/singer Brendan Perry and Australian vocalist Lisa Gerrard, Dead Can Dance transplanted to London in 1982 and quickly became globally renowned for their stylistically diverse and groundbreaking music as well as their incredible live shows. Fusing atmospheric, ambient pop, spiritual undertones, and alt-Electronica with world beats and European folk-both contemporary and centuries old-their string of album masterpieces kicked off in 1984 with a self-titled debut. After disbanding in &amp;#039;99, Perry went solo and Gerrard became a prominent film composer, celebrated for her Golden Globe winning score for Gladiator, among other works.\n\nFusing atmospheric/ambient pop, spiritual undertones, alt-eletronica, world beats, and European folk, their repertoire can never be easily summed up with words. Instead, it is presented here, nearly in its entirety, remastered to exacting standards by Mobile Fidelity Sound Laboratory, one of the most respected audiophile labels in the USA. \n\nRemastered albums:\n\n1984 - Dead Can Dance\n1984 - Garden Of The Arcane Delights EP\n1985 - Spleen And Ideal\n1987 - Within The Realm Of Dying\n1988 - The Serpent&amp;#039;s Egg\n1990 - Aion\n1993 - Into The Labyrinth\n1994 - Toward The Within (Live)\n1996 - Spiritchaser\n\nSet is limited to 1000 copies.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.anus.com/zine/music/dead_can_dance/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.anus.com/zine/music/dead_can_dance/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* ABOUT US *\n\nWe believe in replacing modern society with a culture of honor.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.corrupt.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.corrupt.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29fc5bf5e31731c23818268612f2e6aa47eb64f","amp;dn":"Dead+Can+Dance+-+9+SACD+Limited+Edition+Box+Set+ISOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29fc5bf5e31731c23818268612f2e6aa47eb64f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,159,197,191,94,49,115,28,35,129,130,104,97,47,46,106,164,126,182,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
