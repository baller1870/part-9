But in the nearby thicket of the Honeysuckle Forest, and in the currents of the rushing Undine River, more trouble is stirring. . . .\n\nThe enchanted town of FairwickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dazzling mix of mythical creatures has come under siege from the Grove: a sinister group of witches determined to banish the fey back to their ancestral land. With factions turning on one another, all are cruelly forced to take sides. CallieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother, a prominent Grove member, demands her granddaughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compliance, but half-witch/half-fey Callie can hardly betray her friends and colleagues at the college. \n\nTo stave off disaster, Callie enlists Duncan Laird, an alluring seductive academic who cultivates her vast magical potential, but to what end? Deeply conflicted, Callie struggles to save her beloved Fairwick, dangerously pushing her extraordinary powers to the limitÃ¢â‚¬â€risking all, even the needs of her own passionate heart.\n\n\nGenre: Romance | Fantasy | Paranormal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4edfa9bf83bfc2a2467cef46b1e5f201d48061e3","amp;dn":"Juliet+Dark+-+The+Water+Witch+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4edfa9bf83bfc2a2467cef46b1e5f201d48061e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,223,169,191,131,191,194,162,70,124,239,70,177,229,242,1,212,128,97,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
