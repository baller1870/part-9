It is 1989, and the radio is full of news of border crossings in Berlin as the wall starts to come down. Alois, shuffling around the station, his face grim, looks as if he has seen it all Ã¢â‚¬â€ little excites him. He is used to solitude and getting on with life. But as fog and rain swirl around the station, he finds himself haunted by the past, especially the events at the end of the Second World War. Tortured by these memories, he ends up in a sanatorium. When he is released, he finds that the world has changed: the communist regime has evaporated, and so has his job. But hope arrives in the miraculous form of a woman.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374985&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374985&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Czech\nSubtitles: English, Czech, Portuguese\n\ndvdrip\nRip Specs\tFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFile size : 1.38 GiB \nDuration : 1h 21mn \nOverall bit rate : 2 425 Kbps \nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.3 | www.virtualdub-fr.org || (build 2550/release) \nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2550/release \n\nVideo \nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 1 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG) \nCodec ID : XVID \nCodec ID/Hint : XviD \nDuration : 1h 21mn \nBit rate : 1 967 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 400 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.273 \nStream size : 1.12 GiB (81%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04) \n\nThanks to exvet@KG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ab7065bac07a2bfbb29bc396debd99cfe65131","amp;dn":"Alois+Nebel+%28Tomas+Lunak%2C+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ab7065bac07a2bfbb29bc396debd99cfe65131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,171,112,101,186,192,122,43,251,178,155,195,150,222,189,153,207,230,81,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
