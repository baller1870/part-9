It's a delightful, breezy excursion recorded at Gold Star with Larry Levine engineering the Tommy LiPuma/Herb Alpert production work. &quot;Call Me&quot; is pure Tony Hatch, but without Hatch's standard production technique, giving it a much different flavor from his work with Petula Clark. There's a tongue-in-cheek campiness to Montez's Wayne Newton/Neil Sedaka feminine vocal range, a fact that does not escape the Derek Taylor liner notes, which are a bit odd for this pop/middle of the road blend. What is even more odd is that Chris Montez didn't have a huge comeback during the '70s reign of Captain &amp; Tenille, Rita Coolidge, Helen Reddy, Barry Manilow, and other adult contemporary hit artists who followed in his sugary footsteps. There is only one formula at play here, and A&amp;M milks it for all it is worth: It's in Herb Alpert's arranging a rendition of Bruce Channel's 1962 smash &quot;Hey! Baby,&quot; and it saturates the cocktail elegance of &quot;One Note Samba.&quot; If you can't resist the two big hits, &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;The More I See You&quot; (and who could?), the other ten titles will bring you to the lights of Vegas and '60s schmaltz that is simply glorious. Like &quot;The More I See You,&quot; the third hit in this set, &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot; is from a '40s movie. The former was taken from Betty Grable's Diamond Horseshoe, the latter from Iceberg. But &quot;There Will Never Be Another You,&quot; like the version of &quot;Little White Lies,&quot; has the same backing vocal sound and tempo of &quot;The More I See You,&quot; repeating the arrangement ideas that spawned the initial hits. All of these failed to crack the Top Ten as his first success, &quot;Let's Dance,&quot; did, but inevitably they became the music the singer is most identified with. The powers that be did allow Montez one original, &quot;You, I Love You.&quot; It's a pleasant album track that flows nicely along with the other tunes. Classic pop.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be178b09ad9cba9614910b1565ceb5739184f4c5","amp;dn":"Chris+Montez+-+The+More+I+See+You+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be178b09ad9cba9614910b1565ceb5739184f4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,23,139,9,173,156,186,150,20,145,11,21,101,206,181,115,145,132,244,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
