Here, in the first book on the topic, you will learn how to size these socks as you knit them, with 20 great patterns to pick from. Each of the 20 knee-high patterns comes with a variation that features that design in a different color and style of sock, perfect for knitters who want to mix up their sock drawer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c77059cd936ac19568b806cb1cd341825701339","amp;dn":"Knitting+Knee-Highs%3A+Sock+Styles+from+Classic+to+Contemporary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c77059cd936ac19568b806cb1cd341825701339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,119,5,156,217,54,172,25,86,139,128,108,177,205,52,24,37,112,19,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
