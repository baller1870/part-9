These discs are never intended to be complete, since you'd need a few volumes to cover all the notable singles released during the span of a year. Some odd choices are made, such as T.I.'s &quot;Be Easy&quot; instead of the much bigger hit &quot;Rubber Band Man,&quot; but there are plenty of memorable inclusions. Kanye West's &quot;Through the Wire,&quot; J-Kwon's &quot;Tipsy,&quot; Chingy's &quot;Right Thurr,&quot; &quot;Damn&quot; by YoungbloodZ, and &quot;Can't Stop, Won't Stop&quot; by Young Gunz are the highlights. \n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n\n    01 Damn! - YoungBloodZ\n    02 The Industry - Wyclef Jean\n    03 Right Thurr - Chingy\n    04 Can't Stop, Won't Stop - Young Gunz\n    05 Gangsta Nation - Nate Dogg and Westside Connection\n    06 Clap Back - Ja Rule\n    07 Through the Wire - Kanye West\n    08 Skills - Gang Starr\n    09 Tipsy - J-Kwon\n    10 Quarterbackin' - Clipse and E-40\n    11 Into You - Fabolous and Tamia\n    12 Be Easy - T.I.\n    13 Hotel - R.
