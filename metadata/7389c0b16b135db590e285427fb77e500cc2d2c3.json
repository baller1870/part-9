Louis Theroux - Louis And The Nazis (2003, 79min):\n\nLouis Theroux, innocently looking explorer of social \nphenomena and fringe groups in the USA, this time ventures \ninto the world of &quot;White Pride/Separatism&quot; (Neo-Nazism). \n\nHe visits Tom Metzger, a former leading member of the \nKu Kux Klan in California who feels himself more in \ntune now with the Skinhead movement and has ideas about \nbecoming someone of international significance in the \nright-wing scene. \n\nLouis Theroux's second investigation explores the life \nof April Gaede and her two twin daughters Lynx and Lamb \nwho form the &quot;White Power&quot; duo &quot;Prussian Blue&quot; (the \nlack of this chemical in the gas chambers of Nazi \nslaughter camps was explained by Holocaust deniers \nto be proof of their viewpoint that no industrial \nscale executions could have happened there). \n\nIn the end Louis Theroux confronts Tom Metzger and \nApril Gaede with his own take on their somewhat \nextraordinary view of the world.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395644/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395644/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2. Nazi Pop Twins - Prussian Blue (2007, 49min): \n\nUnlike &quot;Louis and the Nazis&quot; this documentary focuses \nexclusively on the Gaede family with April Gaede as \nthe Arian activist mother and her daughters Lynx and \nLamb at the center. This allows James Quinn to dig a \nlittle deeper than Theroux and reveal serious tensions \nin the family when it becomes more and more apparent \nthat the pop duo does not share their mother's passion \nfor openly expressing extremly divisive views on ethnic \nissues. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073131/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1073131/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Pop_Twins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Pop_Twins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Blue_(American_duo)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Blue_(American_duo)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7389c0b16b135db590e285427fb77e500cc2d2c3","amp;dn":"Louis+Theroux+and+the+Nazis+%282003%29%2C+Nazi+Pop+Twins+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7389c0b16b135db590e285427fb77e500cc2d2c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,137,192,177,107,19,93,181,144,226,133,66,127,183,126,80,12,194,210,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
