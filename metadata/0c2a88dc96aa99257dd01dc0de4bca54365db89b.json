The book showcases a set of representative concepts broadly connected by the theme of information security, for which the presentation of each topic can be treated as a &quot;mini&quot; lecture course, demonstrating how it allows us to solve real problems, as well as how it relates to other subjects. The discussions are further supported by numerous examples and practical hands-on exercises. Features: presents a concise introduction to the study of algorithms and describes how computers work; introduces the concepts of data compression, and error detection and correction; highlights the role of data structures; explores the topic of web-search; reviews both historic and modern cryptographic schemes, examines how a physical system can leak information and discusses the idea of randomness; investigates the science of steganography; provides additional supplementary material at an associated website.\n\nProduct Details:\n\n\nSeries: Undergraduate Topics in Computer Science\nPaperback: 244 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 2014 edition (January 14, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3319040413\nISBN-13: 978-3319040417\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2a88dc96aa99257dd01dc0de4bca54365db89b","amp;dn":"What+Is+Computer+Science%3A+An+Information+Security+Perspective+by","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2a88dc96aa99257dd01dc0de4bca54365db89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,42,136,220,150,170,153,37,125,208,29,192,222,75,202,84,54,93,184,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
