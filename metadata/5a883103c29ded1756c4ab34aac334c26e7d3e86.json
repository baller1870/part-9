A rich businessman from Geneva acquires eight and a half pachinko parlors in Kyoto, Japan. They are run by his son who is fascinated by earthquakes. When the father's beloved wife dies, the son takes him to see Federico Fellini's film 8 1/2 to distract him from his grief and rekindle some interest in the opposite sex. Inspired by Fellini's vision, they bring eight and a half women from Japan and Europe and turn the father's Geneva mansion into a private harem. Amanda Plummer, Toni Collette, Polly Walker and Vivian Wu (the protagonist of Greenaway's previous film The Pillow Book), head the cast of this multi-layered film that failed to reach the degree of critical acclaim of Greenaway's previous works.\n\nFile Name .........................................: 8 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ Women.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,778,868,224 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:01:18\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 672x392 (AR: 1.714)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1754 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.278 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154443/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154443/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a883103c29ded1756c4ab34aac334c26e7d3e86","amp;dn":"8+%26Acirc%3B%26frac12%3B+Women+%28Peter+Greenaway%2C+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a883103c29ded1756c4ab34aac334c26e7d3e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,136,49,3,194,157,237,23,86,196,171,52,170,195,52,194,110,125,62,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
