Julien Pras, well known for the pop magnificence of  his studio session with Calc, was secretly dreaming of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin and  was also sharing these musical fantasies with drummer Benoit Busser and noisy bass player Jimmy Kinast. The three of them make a melodic stoner music using heavy reverbs. Julien PrasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s airy voice mixed with the sound of fuzzy electric guitar gives an aerial dimension to their rolling rhythm. In 2012, Matgaz  join the band (drum). The band already played great festivals as Roadburn, Desert Fest, Les EurockÃƒÂ©ennes, Duna Jam, Sziget,  SXSW etcÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. They did  a lot of tours in almost 20 countries including The US, Scandinavia, England, ScotlandÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The band will be on tour in September 2013 in South America for a tour and a new recording. FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stoner rock emblematic trio MARS RED SKY just inked a deal with European record label Listenable Records, on which the band will release its brand new full-length, out this Spring, as well as a 7Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ EP featuring a live recording at Desertfest London 2013.\n\n\n\nReview by New Noise Magazine:\n\nQuote:\nThe first chords of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Light BeyondÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ invite the listener to something spiritual and heavy. When that hella chugga bass driven ear pumping metal comes along twenty five seconds into it you know youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in for something special.\n\nThey wait about two minutes into it to get down to the real nitty gritty. Julian Pras starts weaving the gospel of a psychedelic stoner rocker. The guitar solo is tantalizing. Lyrically there is something esoteric about this group. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hovering SatellitesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ certainly comes off as an existential understanding of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in the universe.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Holy MondaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sets a good rhythm with its southern styled rock influences. The fuzzy guitar riffs are excellent. Mars Red Sky are kind of an odd cross between shoegaze and heavy metal, but there is nothing pretentious about this eclectic trio. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Join The RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets a little heavier. It drags a long like a slow ride through the day to day life until it drifts off into the spacey hallucinogenic intro of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arcadia.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The fuzz and distortion are echoing in my ear. I feel like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve escaped my body, and may be tripping on LSD even though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not, and the entire time my astral cruise is provided with drummer Matgaz slow enchanting peddling, and Julian PrazÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delightful octaves. Toward the end of this majestic journey the music speeds up and becomes empowering. The outro provides a fitting return to reality. Ã¢â‚¬Å“CirclesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ picks up right around where Ã¢â‚¬Å“Join The RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ left off showing the written work of the three songs and placement to be wonderfully done. Lyrically it is a nice turn around from what the theme of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Join The RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ suggests. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Join The RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes off as a guide to getting by in an ordinary workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“CirclesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is more of a rejection of that standard.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Seen A GhostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is hit or miss. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a slower song that takes a while to get exciting. More experimentation is done here. The band comes from obvious drone influences, and has a place in the post-modern metal community. There is also something authentic about them. These are old school European gypsy spirits with sludge metal and Kyuss love in mind. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seen A GhostÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ unnoticeable convergence with the finale Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beyond The LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pretty neat. It is almost sad to leave this album behind when it comes to that point on the 2:33 minute instrumental outro.\n\nMars Red Sky and I have had a fun trip, but the adventure is just beginning. Of course what a wonderful way to conclude the track in such a way that the album can repeat itself from the beginning perfectly in sync with the closing outro track.\n\nMars Red Sky has much to offer in the coming years.\n\nTracklist:\n\nQuote:\n01 - The Light Beyond\n02 - Hoovering Satellites\n03 - Holy Mondays\n04 - Join the Race\n05 - Arcadia\n06 - Circles\n07 - Seen a Ghost\n08 - Beyond the Light\n\nCheers\nGenre:\tStoner\nSubgenre:\tPsych Stoner from France\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t104.06 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n10 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21d070e48f53907962a33475527822615e52ed3","amp;dn":"Mars+Red+Sky+-+Stranded+in+Arcadia+mp3+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21d070e48f53907962a33475527822615e52ed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,29,7,14,72,245,57,7,150,42,51,71,85,39,130,38,21,229,46,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
