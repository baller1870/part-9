The series kicks off as you get to know Hef's three girlfriends--Holly, Bridget and Kendra--and how life works at the world's most famous Mansion. Tonight the group is off to the AFI salute to George Lucas, and naturally Kendra is running late. After the event, Kendra wants to watch a movie from Hef's extensive collection and continues to ruffle Holly's feathers--and gets her dogs all worked up, too--while looking for it in the master bedroom.
