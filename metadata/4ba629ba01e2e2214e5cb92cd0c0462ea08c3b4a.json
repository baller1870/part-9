For the week of January 6, 2015 Tim McGraw?s ?Shotgun Rider? was played over 7,000 times on U.S. Country Radio. This week, it falls off the chart. Worthy of note: the number 50 song on this week?s chart was played a total of 532 times throughout the USA. We know Shotgun Rider was played far, far more than 532 times last week, especially after just being a number one song 2 weeks ago, but yet nowhere is it listed in the Top 50. On the other hand Parmalee?s ?Close Your Eyes? also drops off the countdown. It has been on EVERY weekly chart since June 2014. Same song. Not even a re-entry. Go figure. Apparently, deleting a song from the chart has something to do with the number of positions it drops over the course of 2-3 weeks.\n\nEnough of my rambling?. 5 great new songs join our U.S. Country Top 30 round up for the week of Jan 20, 2015 with a new number one from Kenny Chesney. Will it be number one next week? Will it even exist in our Top 30 in 2 weeks? Here they are, compiled from iTunes, DJ subscription services, CDs in my personal library and the odd torrent. Enjoy and please seed!\n\n01 Kenny Chesney - Til It's Gone (4:04)\n02 Eric Church - Talladega (4:06)\n03 Luke Bryan - I See You (3:02)\n04 Carrie Underwood - Something In The Water (3:47)\n05 Florida-Gerogia Line - Sun Daze (3:02)\n06 Brad Paisley - Perfect Storm (3:48)\n07 Randy Houser - Like A Cowboy (4:14)\n08 Thomas Rhett - Make Me Wanna (3:39)\n09 Jason Aldean - Just Gettin' Started (3:11)\n10 Blake Sheltom &amp; Ashley Monroe - Lonely Tonight (3:29)\n11 Chase Bryant - Take It On Back (4:03)\n12 Brett Eldredge - Mean To Me (3:45)\n13 Darius Rucker - Homegrown Honey (3:21)\n14 Lee Brice - Drinking Class (3:19)\n15 Chris Young - Lonely Eyes (3:23)\n16 Raelynn - God Made Girls (3:25)\n17 David Nail - Kiss You Tonight (3:45)\n18 Lady Antebellum - Freestyle (3:00)\n19 Cole Swindell - Ain't Worth The Whiskey (3:08)\n20 Jake Owen - What We Ain't Got (3:29)\n21 Dierks Bentley - Say You Do (3:30)\n22 Kristian Bush - Trailer Hitch (2:47)\n23 Tyler Farr - A Guy Walks Into A Bar (3:10)\n24 Sam Hunt - Take Your Time (3:29)\n25 Eric Paslay - She Don't Love You (3:59)\n26 Easton Corbin - Baby Be My Love Song (edit) (3:08)\n27 Toby Keith - Drunk Americans (3:15)\n28 A Thousand Horses - Smoke (3:35)\n29 Billy Currington - Don't It (3:04)\n30 Zac Brown Band - Homegrown (3:21)\n\nRECURRENT Dan + Shay - Show You Off (2:59)\nRECURRENT Maddie &amp; Tae - Girl In A Country Song (3:35)\nRECURRENT Parmalee - Close Your Eyes (3:30)\nRECURRENT Scotty McCreery - Feelin' It (3:14)\nRECURRENT Tim McGraw - Shotgun Rider (3:46)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba629ba01e2e2214e5cb92cd0c0462ea08c3b4a","amp;dn":"Top+30+Country+Jan+20%2C+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba629ba01e2e2214e5cb92cd0c0462ea08c3b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,166,41,186,1,226,226,33,78,92,185,44,208,192,70,46,160,140,59,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
