It was made thinking of all you guys :)\r\n\r\nA very special MULTICAM release shot mostly from people located in the premium area of the stadium, seated at their chairs, therefore very close to the stage and generally with stable enough or less shaky footage. Some songs had up to 9 different point of views available during video editing.\r\n\r\nThis is the very first concert of David Gilmour in Brazil. A special night for Brazilian fans of all ages who waited many years for a chance to see him perfoming live.\r\n\r\nThe title name &quot;Live At Pompeia&quot; was choosed as Allianz Parque (a multiporpouse stadium) is located near by Pompeia Village at Sao Paulo City.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting fact this concert had two interruptions during the beggining of Money when there was a problem with Guy Pratt's bass sound. Available footage from this moment was keep exactly as it was during that night, without any cut.\r\n\r\nVideo footage from Pink Floyd old songs are by far more available than solo David Gilmour songs from this concert. Songs like &quot;Faces of Stone&quot;, &quot;A Boat Lies Waiting&quot; and &quot;The Blue&quot; doesn't offer a complete Multicam experience or may have less picture quality, but they are precious as unique and rare recordings.\r\n\r\nUse only as personal, archiving and educational purposes.
