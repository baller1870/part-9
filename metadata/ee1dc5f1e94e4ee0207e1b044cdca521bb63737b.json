Jobim was also influenced by the music of French Impressionist composer Claude Debussy and by jazz.\nobim found prominence in Brazil when he teamed up with poet and diplomat Vinicius de Moraes to provide the music for the play Orfeu de ConceiÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½o (1956). The most popular song from the show was Se Todos Fossem Iguais A VocÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (&amp;#039;Someone to Light Up My Life&amp;#039;). Later, when the play was turned into a film, French producer Sacha Gordine did not want to use any of the existing music from the play. Gordine asked de Moraes and Jobim for a new score for the film Black Orpheus (1959). Vinicius was at the time away in Montevideo, Uruguay, working for the Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and so he and Jobim were only able to write three songs, primarily over the telephone (A Felicidade, Frevo,and O Nosso Amor).\nThis collaboration was successful and Vinicius went on to pen the lyrics to some of Jobim&amp;#039;s most popular songs. The arranger/conductor/composer Claus Ogerman arranged many of Jobim&amp;#039;s memorable tunes, as did Eumir Deodato. Jobim acquired international fame with the release of the Grammy Award-winning album Getz/Gilberto (1963), featuring the international hit &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; sung by Astrud Gilberto. Jobim composed many other acclaimed albums afterwards (see list below).\nKey collaborators and interpreters of Jobim&amp;#039;s music include JoÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½o Gilberto, (who is often credited along with Jobim as a co-creator of bossa nova), Gal Costa, Elis Regina, Sergio Mendes, Astrud Gilberto, Stan Getz and Frank Sinatra. Various tributes have been paid to Jobim and his body of work and influence by jazz musicians as well as pop performers. For example, American jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald, Andy Williams and Frank Sinatra prominently featured Jobim&amp;#039;s songs on their albums Ella AbraÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½a Jobim (1981, The Shadow of Your Smile(1966) and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967), respectively. Recent works such as Wave: The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook (1996) included performances by the likes of Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Toots Thielemans. Other notable jazz artists who have performed Jobim songs include Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, and Diana Krall. Pop singers, such as Sting and George Michael, have also recorded Jobim songs. Contemporary jazz performers, such as Jane Monheit, continue to record Jobim&amp;#039;s songs (Monheit sang Waters of March on her CD Come Dream With Me). Carlos Santana performed Stoneflower on his Caravanserai album.\nJobim is recognized all over the world as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was musically productive right up to his death as a result of heart failure on December 8, 1994. His last album, Antonio Brasileiro, was released posthumously soon after.\n\nJobim is buried in the CemitÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rio SÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½o JoÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½o Batista in Rio de Janeiro. The GaleÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½o - AntÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½nio Carlos Jobim International Airport in Rio de Janeiro has its name appended in his honour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee1dc5f1e94e4ee0207e1b044cdca521bb63737b","amp;dn":"The+Girl+From+Ipanema+-+The+Antonio+Carlos+Jobim+Songbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee1dc5f1e94e4ee0207e1b044cdca521bb63737b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,29,197,241,233,78,78,224,32,126,27,4,76,220,165,33,187,99,115,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
