Bishop and Michael Waldholz\r\niUniverse | November 1999 | ISBN-10: 1583487409 | PDF | 388 pages | 23.1 mb\r\n\r\nTold with the pacing of a great suspense novel, Genome tells the very real story of what could be the most ambitious scientific research project ever undertaken: the attempt to identify all the genes in the human body; estimated to number from 50,000 to 100,000. These genes, located in the nucleus of the human cell, contain the blueprints for thousands of proteins that make up the body's tissues and vital organs, from muscles to brain cells, as well as the instructions for making the thousands of chemicals that literally give us life.\r\nBy mapping the human genome, scientists can study and even reproduce the chemical components that run the human machine. This knowledge will revolutionize the treatments for and the prevention of diseases. In this newly updated edition, the authors explain how we may soon have the ability to control our genetic fate. This unprecendented power, however, presents society with new dangers. In Genome, we learn much about the fascinating challenges...both scientific and ethical...that lie ahead\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIHTRODUCTION Breakthrough 15\r\nCHAPTER 1 From curse to Crusade 29\r\nCHAPTER 2 Alta 49\r\nCHAPTER 3 Worcester 69\r\nCHAPTER 4 El Mal 81\r\nCHAPTER 5 Bruce Bryer and Reverse Genetics 103\r\nCHAPTER 6 Dystrophin 111\r\nCHAPTER 7 Two Hits 131\r\nCHAPTER 8 Concer Unleashed 154\r\nCHAPTER 9 Genes and the Heart 179\r\nCHAPTER 10 The Map 200\r\nCHAPTER 11 &quot;Siss Im Blut&quot; 225\r\nCHAPTER 12 Genes In A Bottle 249\r\nCHAPTER 13 Predictive Medictne 267\r\nCHAPTER 14 A Niche in Society 285\r\nCHAPTER 15 Choices 307\r\nEPILOGUE 323\r\nNotes 341\r\nINDEX 355\r\n \nhttp://s23.postimg.org/jkkcmmt6z/Genome_The_Story_of_the_Most_Astonishing_Scien.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721dbc84d9402a91e1f9621832ab6fe96939e960","amp;dn":"Genome+-+Story+of+Most+Astonishing+Scientific+Adventure+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721dbc84d9402a91e1f9621832ab6fe96939e960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,29,188,132,217,64,42,145,225,249,98,24,50,171,111,233,105,57,233,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
