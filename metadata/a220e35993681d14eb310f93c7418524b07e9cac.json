Rey, &quot;Perspectives on Spatial Data Analysis&quot; \n Publisher: Springer | ISBN: 3642019757 | edition 2010 | PDF | 290 pages | 3.2 mb\n\n This book takes both a retrospective and prospective view of the field of spatial analysis by combining selected reprints of classic articles by Arthur Getis with current observations by leading experts in the field. Four main aspects are highlighted, dealing with spatial analysis, pattern analysis, local statistics as well as illustrative empirical applications. Researchers and students will gain an appreciation of Getis' methodological contributions to spatial analysis and the broad impact of the methods he has helped pioneer on an impressively broad array of disciplines including spatial epidemiology, demography, economics, and ecology. The volume is a compilation of high impact original contributions, as evidenced by citations, and the latest thinking on the field by leading scholars. This makes the book ideal for advanced seminars and courses in spatial analysis as well as a key resource for researchers seeking a comprehensive overview of recent advances and future directions in the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a220e35993681d14eb310f93c7418524b07e9cac","amp;dn":"Perspectives+on+Spatial+Data+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a220e35993681d14eb310f93c7418524b07e9cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,32,227,89,147,104,29,20,235,49,15,147,199,65,133,36,176,126,156,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
