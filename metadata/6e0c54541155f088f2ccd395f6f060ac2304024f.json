The album was released on 26 August 1991 in the United Kingdom, and peaked at #7 in the UK Albums Chart. It was released in the US a month later with a different track listing. The album was certified Gold in the UK.\n\nThe U.S. version of Leisure was front loaded with Blur's three UK singles and the song &quot;Sing&quot; was replaced by the B-side &quot;I Know&quot; (see track listings for exact changes). &quot;Sing&quot; was included on the Trainspotting soundtrack in 1996. The original version, &quot;Sing (To Me)&quot; was recorded as a demo in late 1988, and can only be heard on the ultra-rare Promo-only single which was released over a decade later in February 2000.\n\nThe album was released during the waning days of the Madchester period in the UK and as a result Blur and Leisure were seen as catching the end of a trend. With the release of their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish in 1993, Blur would drastically reinvent themselves. Lead singer Damon Albarn has since referred to Leisure as &quot;awful&quot;.\n\nInitially, Leisure was well received by the British music press. A highly enthusiastic David Cavanagh wrote in Select magazine that &quot;The four Blur boys have guaranteed themselves a hefty leg-up in the being-taken-seriously stakes with the thrills they've carved into the grooves of 'Leisure'.&quot; He concluded that &quot;[Leisure], in short, is one of those happy occasions when the hype is dead right.&quot; Q magazine's Paul Davies rated the album four out of five stars, and felt it fulfilled the early promise Blur showcased. &quot;This latest bunch of floppy-fringed pop cadets in baggy clothing should consummate their burgeoning pop romance in fine style,&quot; Davies elaborated, &quot;for Leisure is a substantially stocked treasure-chest of hit singles just waiting to happen.&quot;\n\nIn 2008, Coldplay announced upon the release of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends that &quot;Sing&quot; from Leisure provided a starting point for &quot;Lost!&quot;.\n\n(c) Wiki\n\nWell, make up your own mind. &quot;Bang&quot; and &quot;There's No Other Way&quot; at least are worth the download....\n\nEnjoy and please help seeding !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e0c54541155f088f2ccd395f6f060ac2304024f","amp;dn":"Blur+%5B1991%5D+Leisure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e0c54541155f088f2ccd395f6f060ac2304024f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,12,84,84,17,85,240,136,242,204,211,149,246,240,96,172,35,4,2,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
