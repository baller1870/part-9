Mouritsen\n2009 | ISBN: 1441906177 | 330 pages | PDF | 40,6 MB\n\n\nIn recent decades, sushi has gone from being a rather exotic dish, eaten by relatively few outside of Japan, to a regular meal for many across the world. It is quickly gathering the attention of chefs and nutritionists everywhere. It has even made its way into numerous home kitchens where people have patiently honed the specialized craft required to prepare it. Few have been more attuned to this remarkable transition than Ole G. Mouritsen, an esteemed Danish scientist and amateur chef who has had a lifelong fascination with sushiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s central role in Japanese culinary culture.\n\nSushi for the eye, the body, and the soul is a unique melange of a book. In it, Mouritsen discusses the cultural history of sushi then uses his scientific prowess to deconstruct and explain the complex chemistry of its many subtle and sharp taste sensations. He also offers insights from years of honing his own craft as a sushi chef, detailing how to choose and prepare raw ingredients, how to decide which tools and techniques to use, and how to arrange and present various dishes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d694c4d229e793c27bab9188184eb19b5d1d5a","amp;dn":"Sushi+-+Food+for+the+Eye%2C+the+Body+and+the+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d694c4d229e793c27bab9188184eb19b5d1d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,214,148,196,210,41,231,147,194,123,171,145,136,24,78,177,155,93,29,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
