Although the feel of this album is undeniably classic rock, with much of Free's bluesy swagger, it is also vaguely reminiscent of '80s rock at times (check out the Mr. Big-esque verse to &quot;Fire in the Kitchen&quot;). The focus on Tales of Ordinary Madness is clearly on Haynes' songwriting chops. For the most part, the songs on this record are tight and concise, focusing on immediate riffs, gritty vocals, and cool arrangements to sell them. This, however, is not to suggest that Haynes has stopped tearing it up with his guitar, and he amply demonstrates why he is one of the most lauded straight-ahead rock lead guitarists of the '90s. The various bands that back up Haynes are all quite good, and notables Bernie Worrell and producer Leavell both make guest appearances on keyboards. Standout tracks include the mid-tempo &quot;Tattoos and Cigarettes,&quot; which is a great showcase for Haynes' under appreciated vocal talents. The smoky &quot;Blue Radio&quot; is also notable for the artist's emotive singing. In fact, the most exceptional thing about Tales of Ordinary Madness is his vocal performance, the overall impact of which stays with the listener far longer than any particular song or hook. There are some slow moments on this record, but it is great party music, and fans of Haynes' work with the Allman Brothers Band would surely be interested in this recording.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80de89bf0b9c031247679e94ecb8ddfa2439e032","amp;dn":"Warren+Haynes+-+Tales+of+Ordinary+Madness+%5B1993%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80de89bf0b9c031247679e94ecb8ddfa2439e032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,222,137,191,11,156,3,18,71,103,158,148,236,184,221,250,36,57,224,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
