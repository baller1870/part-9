Even during the Cuban Missile Crisis!\n\nAlmost unknown to the public, much of the information on theses tests has been kept secret for over 35 years until recently, when newly declassified test footage and secret government documents obtained from both countries reveals everything from the ICBM to outer space testing to ABM.\n\nFrom filmmaker Peter Kuran, creator of the award-winning film &quot;Trinity and Beyond&quot; .\n\nNarrated by William Shatner. Music performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206179/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206179/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vce.com/nukes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vce.com/nukes.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy the movie, and please seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0219ba8f820fa37538d0e3e4118f36855a17648","amp;dn":"Nukes+In+Space+-+The+Rainbow+Bombs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0219ba8f820fa37538d0e3e4118f36855a17648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,33,155,168,248,32,250,55,83,141,14,62,65,24,243,104,85,161,118,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
