I'm Casey Kasem, this is American Top 40, and the countdown continues on our way to the number one song in the USA.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nThe Canadian who holds the record for the biggest selling album in Canada has two songs from that album in this countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know what woman has had the most hits on the pop chart, the soul chart, and the country chart. Casey says the Queen of Soul has had the most hits on the soul chart with 66 songs. Topping the pop chart with 69 hits is a woman who was once in a group, then went solo, and also has plenty of duets to her Supreme credit.
