Their difficulties are created and portrayed by the spontaneous reactions of the actors themselves, following outlines of the story rather than the memorized lines of a scripted scenario. With minimal editing and direct sound that includes the noise of the camera, the black-and-white realism is rather bleak, reflecting the current state of their once caring relationship. -- Eleanor Mannikka\n\nRipped from the Facets DVD by smig.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
