Eightyone persons died. The hypotheses on the disappearance of the DC9 are three: structural failure, a bomb in the rear toilet of the plane, or an air-to-air missile which struck the civil aircraft by mistake during a battle between unidentified military fighters. Roberta Bellodi, a Sicilian journalist who lost her daughter on that night, and Corrado di Acquaformosa, a Deputy in the Italian Parliament, member of the Commission set up to throw light on the crash of DC 9, try to find out the truth, entangling themselves in a labyrinth of cover-ups, disappearance of proofs and key witnesses.
