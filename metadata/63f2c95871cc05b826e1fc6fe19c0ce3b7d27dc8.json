The solution was pretty simple, but it required unhiding hidden files, deleting and editing files. For some users, this can be scary, so I created a program to do all of this for you.\n\nThe tool is pretty easy; fill in a user name and press the &amp;#039;Create Profile and Fix My Problem!&amp;#039;  button. Once you do so, the application will prompt you to check if you are sure (on a normal working game install, this program will delete your profiles and saved games, so don&amp;#039;t &amp;#039;play&amp;#039; with it if you have a well working game experience).\n\n \nAfter the fix has been applied, you are asked if you want to run the game right away.\n\nOnce in-game, you will notice that where it used to say just &amp;#039;Offline:&amp;#039;, it will now show your username. One this I might want to add is that you cannot enter spaces in your profile name. The program will allow you to enter anything you want, but the game won&amp;#039;t accept it, so keep it a single name without spaces or weird characters.\n\nI have tested this on Vista, but it should work on Windows XP aswel.
