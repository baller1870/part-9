In interviews from 2005, Chris considered choosing the song as the second single from his debut album, but the song &quot;Yo (Excuse Me Miss)&quot; was chosen as the single instead. Along with that, &quot;Gimme That&quot; was also featured at the end of the &quot;Yo (Excuse Me Miss)&quot; music video. A new version of &quot;Gimme That&quot; featuring rapper Lil Wayne was released as a single instead of the album version. The single debuted on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at #80 on April 11, 2006 and climbed the charts quickly, only to peak at #15 on June 6, becoming his first single to miss the top ten in the U.S. and the top twenty in the UK.\n\nMore Info at colombo-reloaded.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b764623a70c1d413ea3d91d06d284a8494463379","amp;dn":"Chris+Brown+ft+Lil+Wayne+-+Gimme+that+%28remix%29-dvdrip%5BCR-Bt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b764623a70c1d413ea3d91d06d284a8494463379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,100,98,58,112,193,212,19,234,61,145,208,109,40,74,132,148,70,51,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
