With geocaching built in and the option to plan, record and share your rides or routes.\n\nAnd imagine that this app doesn't depict mountains and valleys as flat spots on a map, but in THREE DIMENSIONS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including the path you are traveling on. A precise (!) altimeter displays your current elevation at any time. That is Maps 3D.\n\nHow is this possible? We're the first company to combine NASA scans of the Earth's topography with THE outdoor map OSM.\n\nYou'll receive maps of the entire world at no extra cost. With every street, path, rise, track and trail on OSM. Follow or record routes, search functionality, altimeter and numerous features included. You can load free routes from Everytrail and other sources.\n\nAnd the best part: Maps 3D is fun!
