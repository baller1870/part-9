Their performance has been lauded by many critics and voted in numerous polls as being (at least) one the greatest concert performances of all time. No need to elaborate on the event as a whole, as it has been very well-documented. \n\nEach band was permitted precisely 17 minutes on stage, and Queen's basic philosophy was to cram as many hits into that small time frame as possible.

Combined with the energy of the show, his voice was in phenomenal shape, hitting all the high notes. \n\nLater in the evening, Freddie and Brian returned to the stage to perform an emotional rendition of Is This The World We Created, which fit perfectly with the vibe and message of the day. \n\n(and this is &quot;iTunes ready&quot;)\n\npeace, love and shannon hoon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:022896564bd227aa862e0580f8732653366d8684","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Live+Aid+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"022896564bd227aa862e0580f8732653366d8684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,40,150,86,75,210,39,170,134,46,5,128,248,115,38,83,54,109,134,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
