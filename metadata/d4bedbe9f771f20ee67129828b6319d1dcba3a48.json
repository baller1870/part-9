Burn the Heretic II image on a CD.\n 2. Apply the 1.06 update to patch the game to the latest version.\n 3. Enjoy &amp; Seed!\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE!\n\n\n In order to enable the music in Heretic II you must BURN the game on a CD instead of mounting it on a virtual drive. Also you must disable all virtual drives provided by Daemon Tools / Virtual CloneDrive or other emulation software and instead play the game with your burned copy of Heretic II in your CD/DVD-ROM, otherwise you will only get voice and sound effects within the game but NO MUSIC.\n\n\n If you experience crashes rename heretic2.exe to mohaa.exe. I don't know how but it seems to prevent the game from crashing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4bedbe9f771f20ee67129828b6319d1dcba3a48","amp;dn":"Heretic+II+%2F+Heretic+2+%5BPC%5D+%5BENGLISH%5D+%5BFULL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4bedbe9f771f20ee67129828b6319d1dcba3a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,190,219,233,247,113,242,14,230,113,41,130,139,99,25,209,220,186,58,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
