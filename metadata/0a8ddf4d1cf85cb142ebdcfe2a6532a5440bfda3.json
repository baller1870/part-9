In renegade bassist Jaco Pastorius, the band found a formidable composer and improvisor, who possessed deep roots in funk and R&amp;B, yet was equally at home in modern jazz and Afro-Cuban settings. Not coincidentally, the presence of this innovative fretless bassist on Heavy Weather gave Weather Report the rhythmic/melodic dimension it had been missing since Vitous's departure, as evidenced by his voice-like declamations on Zawinul's ballad &quot;A Remark You Made.&quot; On Zawinul's chart-topping, big band-styled arrangement of &quot;Birdland,&quot; Pastorius provided the kind of big, sweeping orchestral gestures the tune required, while on the shifting canvas of Wayne Shorter's &quot;Harlequin,&quot; the bassist's ability to articulate complex chords allowed him to function as a string section unto himself. And on his own &quot;Havona,&quot; Pastorius not only soloed with horn-like artistry, but combined with drummer Alex Acuna and percussionist Manolo Badrena to give Weather Report its funkiest rhythm section ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a8ddf4d1cf85cb142ebdcfe2a6532a5440bfda3","amp;dn":"Weather+Report+-+Heavy+Weather","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a8ddf4d1cf85cb142ebdcfe2a6532a5440bfda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,141,223,77,28,248,92,177,66,235,220,254,42,101,50,165,68,11,253,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
