Pound Foolish also disproves many myths about spending and saving, including: \nSmall pleasures can bankrupt you: Gurus popularÃ‚Â­ized the idea that cutting out lattes and other small expenditures could make us millionaires. But reducÃ‚Â­ing our caffeine consumption will not offset our biggest expenses: housing, education, health care, and retirement. Disciplined investing will make you rich: Gurus also love to show how steady investing can turn modest savings into a huge nest egg at retirement. But these calculations assume a healthy market and a lifetime without any setbacksÃ¢â‚¬â€two conditions that have no connection to the real world. Women need extra help managing money: Product pushers often target women, whose alleged financial ignorance supposedly leaves them especially at risk. In reality, women and men are both terrible at hanÃ‚Â­dling finances. Financial literacy classes will prevent future ecoÃ‚Â­nomic crises: Experts like to claim mandatory sessions on personal finance in school will cure many of our money ills. Not only is there little evidence this is true, the entire movement is largely funded and promoted by the financial services sector.   \nWeaving together original reporting, interviews with experts, and studies from disciplines ranging from behavioral economics to retirement planning, Pound Foolish is a compassionate and compelling book that will change the way we think and talk about our money.
