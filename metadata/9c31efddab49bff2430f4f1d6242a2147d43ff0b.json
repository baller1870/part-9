What we have here are extremely obscure and rare records. \n\nIt's alomost impossible to get a copy of Bully Boys' &quot;Frontispieces&quot; or The Fan's a&quot;Mystery Date&quot; anywhere. \n\nYou may find some used vinyl of Quickflight's &quot;Decent Beat&quot;, but this upload is from master tapes and what was supposed to be the re-issue of the album on CD. Quickflight was a Vancouver, BC band that started as a Christian rock band in the early 80s, but they forgot about Jesus after being imposed to early 80s sound and made this record that is influenced by the Cars. Their frontman, Ric deGroot met the members of Strange Advance and joined them in 1984 and toured Canada with them in 1985. \n\nAuckland Walk's &quot;Rhythmic Tendencies&quot; sometimes shows up on ebay or discogs but you must be lucky to find a good copy like the one I am uploading. Anyhow I do wish you enjoy them. The band was from New Zealand and had local success but remained criminally obscured outside Downunder. \n\nI am certain you'll enjoy these and that you'll seed them for some time!\n\nAuckland Walk - Rhythmic Tendencies [1983]\n\nBully Boy - Frontispieces [1985]\n\nQuickflight - Decent Beat [1983]\n\nThe Fans - Mystery Date [1984]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c31efddab49bff2430f4f1d6242a2147d43ff0b","amp;dn":"4+Rare+80s+Albums+%5BPart+139%5D+New+Wave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c31efddab49bff2430f4f1d6242a2147d43ff0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,49,239,221,171,73,191,242,67,15,79,29,98,66,162,20,125,67,255,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
