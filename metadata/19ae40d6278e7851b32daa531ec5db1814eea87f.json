In Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City, Delisle explores the complexities of a city that represents so much to so many. He eloquently examines the impact of the conflict on the lives of people on both sides of the wall while drolly recounting the quotidian: checkpoints, traffic jams, and holidays.\n \nWhen observing the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations that call Jerusalem home, Delisles drawn line is both sensitive and fair, assuming nothing and drawing everything. Jerusalem showcases once more Delisles mastery of the travelogue.\n\n\t\n\nOf course, some people will see any book about the Israel/Palestine as bad, from both viewpoints,  so please refrain from discussing politics in the comments, this is a comic, you can do that elsewhere.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/zbxjZsJo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/zbxjZsJo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/KCYFKEDZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/KCYFKEDZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/2APYHORw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/2APYHORw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/H4Y97rCV.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/H4Y97rCV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/tOaq3UHH.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/tOaq3UHH.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/AXn2ZHSR.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/AXn2ZHSR.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/7YMThzql.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/7YMThzql.jpg&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/TO46FIxa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/TO46FIxa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ae40d6278e7851b32daa531ec5db1814eea87f","amp;dn":"Jerusalem+-+Chronicles+from+the+Holy+City+%28fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ae40d6278e7851b32daa531ec5db1814eea87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,174,64,214,39,142,120,81,179,45,170,83,30,197,219,24,20,238,168,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
