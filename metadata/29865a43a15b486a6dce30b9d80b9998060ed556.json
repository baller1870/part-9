After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, Verethragna. After killing the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Blandelli, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29865a43a15b486a6dce30b9d80b9998060ed556","amp;dn":"Campione%21+01+-+13+%5BEng+Dub%5D+%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29865a43a15b486a6dce30b9d80b9998060ed556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,134,90,67,161,91,72,106,109,206,48,185,216,11,153,152,6,14,213,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
