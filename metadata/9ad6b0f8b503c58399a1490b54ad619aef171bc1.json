When examined, each weapon leads to a different, previously unsolved murder. Someone has been killing people for twenty years or more and storing the weapons together for some inexplicable purpose.\nConfronted with the sudden emergence of hundreds of unsolved homicides, Tallow soon discovers that hes walked into a veritable deal with the devil. An unholy bargain that has made possible the rise of some of Manhattans most prominent captains of industry. A hunter who performs his deadly acts as a sacrifice to the old gods of Manhattan, who may, quite simply, be the most prolific murderer in New York Citys history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ad6b0f8b503c58399a1490b54ad619aef171bc1","amp;dn":"Gun+Machine+-+Warren+Ellis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ad6b0f8b503c58399a1490b54ad619aef171bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,214,176,248,181,3,197,131,153,161,73,11,84,173,97,154,239,23,27,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
