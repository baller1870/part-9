A University Course\n\nAngela Downing, Philip Locke\n\nRoutledge, 2006 - 610 pages (Second edition)\n\n\n\nPresenting the linguistic basis for courses and projects on translation, contrastive linguistics, stylistics, reading and discourse studies, this book illustrates grammatical usage through authentic texts from a range of sources, both spoken and written.\n\nThis new edition has been thoroughly rewritten and redesigned to include many new texts and examples of language in use. Key features include: chapters divided into modules of class-length materials; a wide variety of authentic texts and transcriptions to illustrate points of grammar and to contextualise structure; clear chapter and module summaries enabling efficient class preparation and student revision; exercises and topics for individual study; answer key for analytical exercises; comprehensive index; select biography; suggestions for further reading; and a companion website. This up-to-date descriptive grammar is a complete course for first degree and postgraduate students of English, and is particularly suited for those whose native language is not English.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff45bf5829e1c300e68198a2dbd3e37e7293e40d","amp;dn":"%5BDowning-Locke%5D+English+Grammar.+A+University+Course.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff45bf5829e1c300e68198a2dbd3e37e7293e40d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,69,191,88,41,225,195,0,230,129,152,162,219,211,227,126,114,147,228,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
