Hope you enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6a23992f6bba24e434d6ff8a82ce6d1165652d","amp;dn":"Cyber+City+OEDO+808+File+1+-+Virtual+Death+%28Memories+of+the+Past","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6a23992f6bba24e434d6ff8a82ce6d1165652d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,106,35,153,47,107,186,36,228,52,214,255,138,130,206,109,17,101,101,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
