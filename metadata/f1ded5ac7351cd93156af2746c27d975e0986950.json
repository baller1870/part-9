I recorded this show on my VHS recorder. The video is 5/10, audio 7/10, better than nothing. Hope you enjoy it.\n\nDr. Wayne W. Dyer reveals how to change the self-defeating thinking patterns that have prevented you from living at the highest levels of success, happiness, and health. Even though you may know what to think, actually changing those thinking habits that have been with you since childhood might be somewhat challenging.\n\nIf I changed, it would create family dramas . . . IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m too old or too young . . . IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m far too busy and tired . . . I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t afford the things I truly want . . . It would be very difficult for me to do things differently . . . and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always been this way . . . may all seem to be true, but theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in fact just excuses. So the business of modifying habituated thinking patterns really comes down to tossing out the same tired old excuses and examining your beliefs in a new and truthful light.\n\nIn this groundbreaking work, Wayne presents a compendium of conscious and subconscious crutches employed by virtually everyone, along with ways to cast them aside once and for all. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn to apply specific questions to any excuse, and then proceed through the steps of a new paradigm. The old, habituated ways of thinking will melt away as you experience the absurdity of hanging on to them.\n\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ultimately realize that there are no excuses worth defending, ever, even if theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always been part of your lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the joy of releasing them will resonate throughout your very being. When you eliminate the need to explain your shortcomings or failures, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll awaken to the life of your dreams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1ded5ac7351cd93156af2746c27d975e0986950","amp;dn":"Wayne+Dyer+-+Excuses+Begone%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1ded5ac7351cd93156af2746c27d975e0986950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,222,213,172,115,81,205,147,21,106,242,116,108,39,217,117,224,152,105,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
