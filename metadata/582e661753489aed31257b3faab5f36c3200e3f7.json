This run was immensely popular and featured some great writing and art. Judd Winnick also had a long spell at the helm of this title, and it would all lead into the eventual marriage of GA and Black Canary (in an entirely separate run). These brand new DIGITAL copies of the whole volume are presented thanks to Empire; huge thanks to them for their (usual) great work. Please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:582e661753489aed31257b3faab5f36c3200e3f7","amp;dn":"Green+Arrow+v3+01-75+%282001-2007%7CDigital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"582e661753489aed31257b3faab5f36c3200e3f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,46,102,23,83,72,154,237,49,37,123,63,170,181,243,108,50,0,227,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
