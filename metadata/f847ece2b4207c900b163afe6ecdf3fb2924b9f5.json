He is best known for his highly detailed nymph dressing and his river nymph fishing. He is in high demand for fly tying demonstrations and fly fishing teach-ins, and so far he has visited Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany and the USA. His first book Oliver Edwards&amp;#039; Flytyers&amp;#039; Masterclass was published in September 1994. This has also now been published in the USA, and German and Finnish editions are due out later this year. Oliver, who holds APGAI qualifications in fly tying and casting, says the biggest buzz he now gets from fishing is teaching people to fish classic upstream nymph to unsighted fish.\n\nEnjoy &amp; please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f847ece2b4207c900b163afe6ecdf3fb2924b9f5","amp;dn":"Fly+Fishing+With+Oliver+Edwards+-+%28Sight+%26+Search+Fishing%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f847ece2b4207c900b163afe6ecdf3fb2924b9f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,71,236,226,180,32,124,144,11,22,58,254,110,205,243,251,41,36,185,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
