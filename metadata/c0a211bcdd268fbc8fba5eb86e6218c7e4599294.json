Before an appreciative crowd of 56,000 fans in the natural amphitheater near Slane Castle in Ireland, Adams and his bandmates (drummer Mickey Curry and guitarist Keith Scott) provide a hard-driving set of Adams's best-known songs, working wonders with their muscular three-piece arrangements. While providing a solid bass foundation, Adams is an amiable host in top form, moving quickly and confidently from rockers like &quot;It's Only Love&quot; to the chart-topping ballad &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,&quot; and the crowd proves its devotion with a massive sing-along. Former Spice Girl Mel C. appears--along with a lucky girl from the audience--for a lively rendition of &quot;When You're Gone,&quot; and the entire concert is faithfully reproduced in crystal-clear 5.1-channel audio. It's a rockin' good show, and the backstage footage and interviews are a welcome bonus. --Jeff Shannon\n\nRecorded live at Slane Castle, Ireland, August 26, 2000\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Region: 1\n\nSelections:\n1.
