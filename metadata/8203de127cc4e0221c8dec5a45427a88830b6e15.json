Such structure should improve legibility of the book and helps to integrate all singular chapters as a logical whole.\n\nContents\nPreface\nSection 1 Engine Fuelling, Combustion and Emission\n1 Factors Determing Ignition and Efficient Combustion in Modern Engines Operating on Gaseous Fuels\n2 Fundamental Studies on the Chemical Changes and Its Combustion Properties of Hydrocarbon Compounds by Ozone Injection\n3 Syngas Application to Spark Ignition Engine Working Simulations by Use of Rapid Compression Machine\n4 Thermodynamic Study of the Working Cycle of a Direct Injection Compression Ignition Engine\n5 The Effect of Injection Timing on the Environmental Performances of the Engine Fueled by LPG in the Liquid Phase\nSection 2 Engine Design, Control and Testing\n6 Intelligent Usage of Internal Combustion Engines in Hybrid Electric Vehicles\n7 Modeling and Simulation of SI Engines for Fault Detection\n8 The Study of Inflow Improvement in Spark Engines by Using New Concepts of Air Filters\n9 Understanding Fuel Consumption/Economy of Passenger Vehicles in the Real World","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8203de127cc4e0221c8dec5a45427a88830b6e15","amp;dn":"Internal+Combustion+Engines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8203de127cc4e0221c8dec5a45427a88830b6e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,3,222,18,124,196,224,34,28,141,236,90,69,66,122,136,131,11,110,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
