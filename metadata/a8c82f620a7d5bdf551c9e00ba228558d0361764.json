That is not to say that she is merely competent.  No, she is a jazz singer of the highest order.  On the swingers (eg, &quot;No Soap, No Hope Blues&quot; and &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot;), she displays a great sense of rhythm and fun along with some top notch improvising.  As for the love ballads (eg, &quot;When the World Was Young,&quot; &quot;Angel Eyes,&quot; and &quot;If the Moon Turns Green&quot;), she infuses each song with nostalgia and longing.  This very excellent collection weighs more in the ballads.  I recommend it highly, especially for those new to Anita O'Day or to jazz singing.  ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nMs O'Day's combination of joyous tone and hip musical sensibility is gloriously captured on the 16 track compilation which she helped put together.  From her earliest Clef 10&quot; LP ANITA O'DAY COLLATES (1952) as well as her 1956 classic ANITA, among others, and featuring some of the best arrangements and bands including Buddy Bregman, Johnny Mandel and Russ Garcia, this is the ONE MS O'DAY to have if you only want one.  Highlights include two tracks with THE THREE SOUNDS (FLY ME TO THE MOON and AH THE APPLE TREES, WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG and a reprise of BOOGIE BLUES with Gary McFarland.  Although she was great when swinging with the KRUPA-ELDRIDGE BAND in the 1940's, this disc is a must have.  Ms O'Day is a legend and a musical hero.  ~ Ian Muldoon\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 49 - Anita O'Day Tracks:\n01  That Old Feeling 2:29\n02  Boogie Blues 3:47\n03  Angel Eyes 3:41\n04  Fly Me To The Moon 3:48\n05  When The World Was Young 3:36\n06  Ten Cents A Dance 2:17\n07  Easy Come, Easy Go 3:13\n08  The No Soap, No Hope, No Mouse, No House Blues 2:35\n09  Just In Time 2:50\n10  Old Devil Moon 2:55\n11  A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square 4:04\n12  Them There Eyes 2:38\n13  If The Moon Turns Green 2:56\n14  Johnny One Note 1:53\n15  Waiter, Make Mine Blues 3:23\n16  What Is This Thing Called Love? 2:30\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c82f620a7d5bdf551c9e00ba228558d0361764","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+49+-+Anita+O%5C%27Day+%281995%29+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c82f620a7d5bdf551c9e00ba228558d0361764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,200,47,98,10,125,91,223,85,28,158,0,186,34,133,88,208,54,23,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
