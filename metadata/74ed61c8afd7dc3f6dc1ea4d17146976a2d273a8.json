From zombie-infested woods in a post apocalyptic America to faery-haunted rural fields in eighteenth- century England, from the kingdoms of high fantasy to the alien world of a galaxy-spanning empire, these are stories of lovers who must struggle against the forces of magic and fate. \n\nAward-winning, bestselling author Neil Gaiman demonstrates why heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the hottest stars in literature today with Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Thing About Cassandra,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a subtle but chilling story of a man who meets an old girlfriend he had never expected to see. \n\nInternational blockbuster bestselling author Diana Gabaldon sends a World War II RAF pilot through a stone circle to the time of her Outlander series in Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Leaf on the Winds of All Hallows.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Torn from all he knows, Jerry MacKenzie determinedly survives hardship and danger, intent on his goal of returning home to his wife and babyÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter the cost. \n\nNew York Times bestselling author Jim Butcher presents Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Hurts,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which Harry Dresden takes on one of his deadliest adversaries and in the process is forced to confront the secret desires of his own heart. \n\nJust the smallest sampling promises unearthly delights, but look also for stories by New York Times bestselling romance authors Jo Beverley and Mary Jo Putney, and by such legends of the fantasy genre as Peter S. Beagle and Tanith Lee, as well as many other popular and beloved writers, including Marjorie M. Liu, Jacqueline Carey, Carrie Vaughn, and Robin Hobb.
