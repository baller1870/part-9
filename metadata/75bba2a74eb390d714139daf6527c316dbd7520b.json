Such methods underpin high quality analyses in areas such as the safety of food, water and medicines, environmental monitoring, and chemical manufacturing. The treatment throughout emphasises the underlying statistical ideas, and no detailed knowledge of mathematics is required. There are numerous worked examples, including the use of Microsoft Excel and Minitab, and a large number of student exercises, many of them based on examples from the analytical literature.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: Prentice Hall; 6 edition (27 May 2010)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 0273730428\n# ISBN-13: 978-0273730422","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75bba2a74eb390d714139daf6527c316dbd7520b","amp;dn":"Statistics+and+Chemometrics+for+Analytical+Chemistry%2C6th+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75bba2a74eb390d714139daf6527c316dbd7520b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,187,162,167,78,179,144,215,20,19,157,175,101,39,195,22,219,215,82,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
