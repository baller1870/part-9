I am currently looking for the solutions manual and if I come across it I'll post it but for now, you're just going to have to deal with ODD answers in the back of the book.\n\nI used this book for Calculus 1, 2 and 3.  (MAC2311, MAC2312, MAC2313). Hope this is what you're looking for and that I detailed its properties correctly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de1fd0de3c53c23cce1683dc66600a79fc66d288","amp;dn":"Calculus+Early+Trasncendentals+%28Anton%2C+Bivens%2C+Davis%29+9E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de1fd0de3c53c23cce1683dc66600a79fc66d288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,31,208,222,60,83,194,60,206,22,131,220,102,96,10,121,252,102,210,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
