Want help choosing the best architecture for your application? \nWith everything you need to know about the key new converter architectures, \nthis guide is for you. It presents basic principles, circuit and system \ndesign techniques and associated trade-offs, doing away with lengthy \nmathematical proofs and providing intuitive descriptions upfront. Everything \nfrom time-to-digital converters to comparator-based/zero-crossing ADCs is \ncovered and each topic is introduced with a short summary of the essential \nbasics. Practical examples describing actual chips, along with extensive \ncomparison between architectural or circuit options, ease architecture \nselection and help you cut design time and engineering risk. Trade-offs, \nadvantages and disadvantages of each option are put into perspective with a \ndiscussion of future trends, showing where this field is heading, what is \ndriving it and what the most important unanswered questions are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:640e5b09d119f0d794c9fba4a29515995a45abb2","amp;dn":"Cambridge+University+Press+Advanced+Data+Converters+2011+Retail+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"640e5b09d119f0d794c9fba4a29515995a45abb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,14,91,9,209,25,240,215,148,201,251,164,162,149,21,153,90,69,171,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
