'Cause this was one woman Shane couldn't live without...To Dr. Rebecca Knight, everything was explainable. Until she started having some very irrational thoughts about sexy Shane MacKade. She didn't know much about men, but she knew one thing for sure: Loving Shane was dangerous--and Rebecca didn't like to take chances","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c00ddc61ed79e48a360c82e24c0bcf3dfdff8f","amp;dn":"Nora+Roberts+-+The+Fall+of+Shane+MacKade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c00ddc61ed79e48a360c82e24c0bcf3dfdff8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,192,13,220,97,237,121,228,138,54,12,130,226,76,11,207,61,253,255,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
