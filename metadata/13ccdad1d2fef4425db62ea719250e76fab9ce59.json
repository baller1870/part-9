In between come a clutch of pieces from that fascinating period of Stravinskyâ€™s life when he was moving from Russianism to neo-classicism via jazz. The remaining two, the Octet of 1923 and the Septet of 1953, are both firmly in Stravinskyâ€™s witty, poised neo-classical style, though the Septet is moving towards new, tougher territory.\r\nStravinsky himself made classic recordings of these pieces in the Sixties, now reissued on CD on the Sony label. These are always electric, if sometimes a little untidy, and so closely recorded you feel the players are sitting in your lap. By that lofty benchmark this new recording measures up superbly. Tempos are just as brisk and alert as Stravinskyâ€™s, the accents just as incisive. These qualities are combined with a beautiful soft-grained tone â€“ a nice change from Stravinskyâ€™s lemon-sharp sound. The Septet in particular came up very fresh: in the composerâ€™s version the middle movement felt gruff and crabbed; here it has a mysterious grave quality, as of a procession seen through a veil.
