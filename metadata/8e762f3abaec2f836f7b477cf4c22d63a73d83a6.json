Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remain today along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess.\nDream Theater has become a successful progressive metal band. Although the band has had a few successful hits (notably &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; in the early 1990s, which received extensive MTV rotation), they have mostly stayed underground for their career.\nThe band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Dream Theater's members have collaborated with many other notable musicians. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any other invited guitarist, following in the footsteps of Eric Johnson and Robert Fripp.\nThe band's highest selling album is the gold selling Images and Words (1992), which reached #61 on the Billboard 200 charts. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at #32 and #46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the Music Section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. In 2007, Systematic Chaos entered US Billboard 200 at #19. Dream Theater has sold over two million albums in the U.S., and over 8 million records worldwide. The band's tenth studio album, Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings, was released on June 23, 2009. It entered the US Billboard 200 at #6 and Eurochart Hot 100 at #1, marking their highest entry on either chart.\n\n01 A Nightmare to Remember.mp3 (22.18 megabyte)\n02 A Rite of Passage.mp3 (11.8 megabyte)\n03 Wither.mp3 (7.45 megabyte)\n04 The Shattered Fortress.mp3 (17.59 megabyte)\n05 The Best of Times.mp3 (18.04 megabyte)\n06 The Count of Tuscany.mp3 (26.43 megabyte)\n\n07 Stargazer.mp3 (11.22 megabyte)\n08 Tenement Funster-Flick of the Wrist-Lily of the Valley.mp3 (11.39 megabyte)\n09 Odyssey.mp3 (10.98 megabyte)\n10 Take Your Fingers from My Hair.mp3 (11.4 megabyte)\n11 Larks Tongues in Aspic, Pt. 2.mp3 (8.97 megabyte)\n12 To Tame a Land.mp3 (9.96 megabyte)\n\n13 A Nightmare to Remember [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (21.47 megabyte)\n14 A Rite of Passage [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (11.8 megabyte)\n15 Wither [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (7.51 megabyte)\n16 The Shattered Fortress [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (17.53 megabyte)\n17 The Best of Times [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (18.3 megabyte)\n18 The Count of Tuscany [Instrumental Mix].mp3 (25.78 megabyte)\nFront - Open.jpg (1.03 megabyte)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e762f3abaec2f836f7b477cf4c22d63a73d83a6","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+Black+Clouds+%26+Silver+Linings+3CD+Covs+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e762f3abaec2f836f7b477cf4c22d63a73d83a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,118,47,58,186,236,47,131,111,123,71,124,244,194,45,99,167,61,131,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
