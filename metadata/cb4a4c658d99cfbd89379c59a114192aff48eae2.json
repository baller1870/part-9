This is Kurosawa&amp;#039;s first color film, and there seems to be an almost psychedelic overlay to his production palette. The story revolves around a collection of characters held together only by the frayed thread of poverty. Rokkuchan (Yoshitaka Zushi), a teenager with the mind of a boy, is obsessed with trolley cars. He draws them from every angle in vivid colors. His despondent mother (Kin Sugai) hangs them lovingly on the walls and windows of their simple home.\n\nEvery morning Rokkuchan goes out to his imaginary trolley car and makes his way through the surrounding slums. His neighbors include a humble man with a terrible limp and an unforgiving wife, two couples who color-coordinate their husband-swapping, and a sad derelict man with an adoring but doomed little boy. During the day, father and son pass the time building a dream house in their minds. At night they sleep in an abandoned car.\nLuanne Brown\n\nA voice from IMDB\n\nThis one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans, but I thought it was wonderful. It&amp;#039;s an episodic multi-character study of Tokyo&amp;#039;s poorest, who live in a city literally made from garbage. Though it looks like an A-Bomb just hit, the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing, but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When not searching for food, they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house. An emotionally moving and beautiful film.\n\nAnother voice from IMDB\n\nAnother demonstration of Kurosawa&amp;#039;s genius, his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town. Swinging from comedy to tragedy and back, this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way, mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads, withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol. Mixing kitchen-sink realism with Kabuki-esque theatrics, Kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness. A wonderful, draining experience.\n\nGreat thanks to pa6sur for the rip\n\nFile Name .............: Akira Kurosawa - Dodesukaden.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,623,064,576 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 2:14:10 (4194280 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ............: 656x480 [=1.367]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1517 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.193 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 90 kb/s [1 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\nstandalone friendly\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
