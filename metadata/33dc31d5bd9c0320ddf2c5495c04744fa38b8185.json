About six years ago, I began presenting this information to chiropractors and students at various meetings around the country. Most had either forgotten or never learned the details about nociception and inflammation, and most were also unaware of the nutritional factors that could influence these two important processes. Without this information, it is very difficult to appreciate how nutrition can support chiropractic care, tissue healing and the functional restoration of musculoskeletal structures.\n\nThe purpose of this text is to address these topics. The first four chapters provide foundational information and focus on nociception, inflammation, pharmacology, and important conceptual issues related to chiropractic and nutrition. The remaining chapters are devoted to clinical nutrition topics that relate directly to nociception, inflammation, and several conditions encountered in chiropractic practice.\nDavid R.
