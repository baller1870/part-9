This doesn't capture their peak as well as Records, but it does cover more ground, which means it has &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; and &quot;Say You Will,&quot; among other late-'80s hits. Yes, it doesn't have &quot;Midnight Blue,&quot; unlike Jukebox Heroes, but that is, after all, a Lou Gramm solo hit. If you're looking for all of the hits by Foreigner proper, this is indeed the way to go, since it has all of them on one disc, with nice sound and packaging -- just like  the Complete Greatest Hits series promises. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Feels like the first time [03:13] \n 02.Cold as ice [03:20] \n 03.Long, long way from home [02:52] \n 04.Headknocker [03:01] \n 05.Hot blooded [03:05] \n 06.Double vision [03:36] \n 07.Blue morning, blue day [03:11] \n 08.Dirty white boy [03:39] \n 09.Head games [03:40] \n 10.Women [03:27] \n 11.Girl on the moon [03:53] \n 12.Urgent [04:20] \n 13.Waiting for a girl like you [04:35] \n 14.Juke box hero [04:05] \n 15.I want to know what love is [05:01] \n 16.That was yesterday [03:46] \n 17.Heart turns to stone [04:10] \n 18.I don't want to live [03:58] \n without you \n 19.Say you will [04:14] \n 20.Soul doctor [04:53] \n ____ \n \n 75:59 min \n 113,1 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefa90360c4fbb5da8a4e374ec12f341838a889a","amp;dn":"Foreigner-Complete_Greatest_Hits-%28Retail%29-2002-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefa90360c4fbb5da8a4e374ec12f341838a889a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,250,144,54,12,79,187,93,168,164,227,116,236,18,243,65,131,138,136,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
