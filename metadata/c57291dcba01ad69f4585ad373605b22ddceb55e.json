(also known Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿QuiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n puede matar a un niÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o? and Island of the Damned) is a 1976 Spanish horror film directed by Narciso IbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ez Serrador. It is about an English couple who find an island inhabited by maniacal children.\n\nThe film was based on a novel by Juan JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Plans and adapted for cinema by Narciso IbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ez Serrador. It had been virtually unavailable officially until it was released on DVD by Dark Sky Films in June 2007.\n\n*\n\nThis rip is from the recent Dark Sky Films release and is the English dub of the movie. The torrent contains English subtitles for certain scenes that are spoken in Spanish.\nUnfortunately the source DVD appears to have some subtitling errors. Doktor_Cult was unable to successfully rip English subs without ripping the Spanish subs as well. The Spanish subs are also in English, but apply to the Spanish dub of the film (not included here). This is the English dub, with English subs where necessary.\n\nIn VLC player make sure the English subtitles are enabled, unless you speak Spanish. Don't bother with the &quot;Spanish&quot; subtitles.\n\n*\n\nREADME:\n\nWho Can Kill A Child?\n\nRipped and seeded by Doktor_Cult.\n\n*\n\nSource DVD Info:\nDARK SKY FILMS Release\nMPEG2 720x480 NTSC 16:9 letbox.\nPGC 1.\nLength: 1:51:53:25.\n\n*\n\nFile Info:\n\nVideo:\nFrame width: 592x320.\nData rate: 6kbps.\nTotal bit rate: 109kbps.\nFrame rate: 23 frames/second.\n\nAudio:\nBit rate: 102kbps.\n\nSize: 717,086 KB (700 MB).\n\n*\n\nAudio Language: English.\nSub Language: English (during Spanish speaking parts).\n\nN.B.
