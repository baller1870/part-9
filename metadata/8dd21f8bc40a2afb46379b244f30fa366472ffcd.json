What is the source of order in our universe? What is its ultimate future?\nCurrent understanding of our universe dictates that all matter will eventually thin out to zero density, with huge black holes finally evaporating away into massless energy. Roger PenroseÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the most innovative mathematicians of our timeÃ¢â‚¬â€turns around this predominant picture of the universe's &quot;heat death,&quot; arguing how the expected ultimate fate of our accelerating, expanding universe can actually be reinterpreted as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; of a new one.\nAlong the way to this remarkable cosmological picture, Penrose sheds new light on basic principles that underlie the behavior of our universe, describing various standard and nonstandard cosmological models, the fundamental role of the cosmic microwave background, and the key status of black holes. Ideal for both the amateur astronomer and the advanced physicistÃ¢â‚¬â€with plenty of exciting insights for eachÃ¢â‚¬â€Cycles of Time is certain to provoke and challenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd21f8bc40a2afb46379b244f30fa366472ffcd","amp;dn":"Roger+Penrose+-+Cycles+of+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd21f8bc40a2afb46379b244f30fa366472ffcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,210,31,139,196,10,42,251,70,55,155,36,79,48,250,54,100,114,255,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
