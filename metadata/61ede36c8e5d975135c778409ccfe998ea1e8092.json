The idea of creating life has fascinated society since the earliest days of science fiction. The first installment of the four-part series, Robots transports viewers from the first steps of FrankensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monster to the threat provided by the Terminator and the world of Cyberspace. Find out how Rutger Hauer created one of the greatest speeches in all of science fiction for Blade Runner. Discover from Kenny Baker the challenge of acting in Star Wars while inside the body of R2D2, and learn how Anthony Daniels was drawn to the role of C-3PO by concept art modeled closely on the robot from the silent classic Metropolis. Douglas Trumbull (2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner) discusses how he managed to create a whole new approach to robot design. The creators of the original Robocop describe how its hidden depths have given it enduring appeal and William Gibson reveals the origins of his seminal novel Neuromancer. From HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey to the Cylons of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica and the world of The Matrix, this is a journey that asks, what does it mean to be human?\n\n\n2014-04-26 - Space (Video:H264 1280x720, 3038kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 97kbps)\n\nWhat if we could explore the vastness of Space? Science fiction has always fed upon our need to explore, to wonder what is out there. Space journeys from Jules VerneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest ideas about attempts to leave our planet, to the Star Wars far away galaxy through to Nichelle Nichols revealing how her groundbreaking role as Lt. Uhura in Star Trek led to her participation in the recruitment of NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s astronauts. It explores the deep sea inspiration for Avatar, finds out why Ursula K Le Guin wrote The Left Hand of Darkness and discovers how Stanley Kubrick was able to make 2001: A Space Odyssey seem so believable.

Much of science fiction explores the moment of first contact, what will people do when the aliens land? From H. G. WellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pioneering The War of the Worlds to Independence Day, Men in Black, and District 9, Invasion deals with our fears of alien invasions of earth. David Tennant explains the appeal of Doctor WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daleks and Cybermen while John Carpenter and Chris Carter explore the rich appeal of the paranoia fueled by hidden aliens with The Thing and The X-Files. It also asks, what if the monsters were our own creation? With the aid of rarely seen animation tests, Phil Tippett takes us behind the scenes in the creation of the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. But not all invasions are hostile. Peter Coyote and Richard Dreyfuss discuss the creation of SpielbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spellbinding classics E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. There is more than one kind of invasion.\n\n\n2014-08-16 - Time (Video:H264 1280x720, 3010kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 100kbps)\n\nWhat if we could travel not just through space, but through time itself? If you could travel through time, would you change the past or the future? What if you found it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be changed? What price does the time traveler, and the people they are closest to, pay? This is a journey from H. G. WellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Time Machine through ideas like The Grandfather Paradox and The Butterfly Effect to the professional time traveler that is the ever popular Doctor Who. Steven Moffat, David Tennant, Karen Gillan, and Neil Gaiman offer a unique perspective on the Doctor. Edward James Olmos reveals the hidden meaning of the language he created for the vision of the future that is Blade Runner. Bob Gale and Christopher Lloyd take us behind the scenes of Back to the Future, while Ed Solomon describes the joy of solving a time travel conundrum for Bill &amp; TedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Excellent Adventure. But what would be the physical and emotional cost to the time traveler? Audrey Niffenegger explains what inspired her novel The Time Traveler's Wife. And what if someone from the future tried to travel back in time to warn us? Would we believe them? From the apocalyptic tones of 12 Monkeys to the drama of Quantum Leap and the comedy of Groundhog Day, time travel is a subject that has been irresistible to the creators of every type of science fiction.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ede36c8e5d975135c778409ccfe998ea1e8092","amp;dn":"The+Real+History+of+Science+Fiction+%282014%29+-+BBC+America+-+4+HD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ede36c8e5d975135c778409ccfe998ea1e8092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,237,227,108,142,93,151,81,53,199,120,64,156,207,233,152,234,30,128,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
