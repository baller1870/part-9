Although the head director of the school board speficically orders him to handle the problematic class 3-D, the students are just too much for him. So Sawatari goes far away to a southern island to search for Yankumi, and convince her to work for Akado. Yankumi accepts the offer, only to find that her class (again) is full of punks, where two rival groups of students are always at each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throats. Will YankumiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong belief in students and teaching work this time?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eb84b39e132fee738d8813dd6fab8a1f379cec9","amp;dn":"Gokusen+3+%28J-Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eb84b39e132fee738d8813dd6fab8a1f379cec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,184,75,57,225,50,254,231,56,216,129,61,214,250,184,161,243,121,206,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
