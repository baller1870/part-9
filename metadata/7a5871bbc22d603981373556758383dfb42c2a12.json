Crashing into jungles known to be inhabited by head hunters, pilots Bill and Joe race against time to fix the engines and attempt a take off. The situation brings out the best and worst in the stranded dozen as they create a makeshift runway and prepare to escape before the natives attack. But damage to the plane and low fuel reserves means that only 5 people can be carried to safety. \n\n\n  note: Not my torrent , just bringing it to TPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5871bbc22d603981373556758383dfb42c2a12","amp;dn":"1939+Five+Came+Back+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5871bbc22d603981373556758383dfb42c2a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,88,113,187,194,45,96,57,129,55,53,86,117,131,131,223,180,44,42,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
