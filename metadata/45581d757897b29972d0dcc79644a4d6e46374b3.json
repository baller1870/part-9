Firing from entrenched positions, the enemy was positioned to wipe out one hundred men who were pinned down and were repeatedly refused artillery support. Ordered to remain behind with the vehicles, twenty-one year-old Marine corporal Dakota Meyer disobeyed orders and attacked to rescue his comrades.\n\nWith a brave driver at the wheel, Meyer stood in the gun turret exposed to withering fire, rallying Afghan troops to follow. Over the course of the five hours, he charged into the valley time and again. Employing a variety of machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and even a rock, Meyer repeatedly repulsed enemy attackers, carried wounded Afghan soldiers to safety, and provided cover for dozens of others to escapeÃ¢â‚¬â€supreme acts of valor and determination. In the end, Meyer and four stalwart comradesÃ¢â‚¬â€an Army captain, an Afghan sergeant major, and two MarinesÃ¢â‚¬â€cleared the battlefield and came to grips with a tragedy they knew could have been avoided. For his actions on that day, Meyer became the first living Marine in three decades to be awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\n\n\n                           Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                           Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n            Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45581d757897b29972d0dcc79644a4d6e46374b3","amp;dn":"Into+the+Fire+by+Dakota+Meyer+-+A+Firsthand+Account+of+Afghan+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45581d757897b29972d0dcc79644a4d6e46374b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,88,29,117,120,151,178,153,114,208,220,199,150,68,164,214,228,99,116,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
