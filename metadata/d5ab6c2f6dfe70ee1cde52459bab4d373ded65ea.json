The series charts the revolution that food production in Britain underwent in the 20th Century, and examines the impact this had on the lives of farmers and consumers alike. With episodes focusing on milk, fruit and vegetables, wheat, and beef, as well as intimate and touching home movies recorded at the time, the series provides an original and largely unseen record of a century of revolution on the land. \nThis is a brilliant documentary series: with its use of archive home video it is both a loving and moving memorial to times long gone --The Times\nStrange but true - in the 1950s, strawberries were virtually the size of apples. It's a fact you can verify for yourself in this excellent social history series&quot; --The Guardian\nShorlisted for the Best History Documentary Grierson Award\n\n\n\n\n2)  Fruit and Veg \nThe changing methods of growing, picking and selling produce is told through three staples of the British landscape: apples, strawberries and tomatoes. Home movies and archive footage reveal the extent of the revolution; and the impact supermarkets had on the fortunes of small and medium-sized farmers.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1617 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5154477/The-One-to-Watch-Wednesday-15-April.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5154477/The-One-to-Watch-Wednesday-15-April.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ab6c2f6dfe70ee1cde52459bab4d373ded65ea","amp;dn":"BBC+Mud+Sweat+and+Tractors+The+Story+of+Agriculture+2of4+Fruit+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ab6c2f6dfe70ee1cde52459bab4d373ded65ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,171,108,47,109,254,112,238,28,222,82,69,155,171,77,55,61,237,101,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
