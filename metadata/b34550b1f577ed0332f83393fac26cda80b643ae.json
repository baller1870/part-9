I have some anniversary\nepisodes of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and Late Night with David\nLetterman, as well as the 1993 MTV Music Video Awards.\n\n\nThis is the 10th anniversary episode of the Late Night with David Letterman, \nwhich aired in prime time.  The sound is kinda muffled \nand the video quality isn't great, but that is to be expected given that it \nwas taped from TV almost 25 years ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34550b1f577ed0332f83393fac26cda80b643ae","amp;dn":"Late+Night+with+David+Letterman+-+10th+Anniversary+Special.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34550b1f577ed0332f83393fac26cda80b643ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,69,80,177,245,119,237,3,50,248,51,147,250,194,108,218,128,182,67,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
