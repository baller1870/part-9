His mother tongue is German but he chose Hebrew as his literary vehicle for its precision, succinctness and biblical imagery.\n\nIn 1941, when he was eight years old, the Romanian Army retook his hometown after a year of Soviet occupation and his mother was murdered.  Appelfeld was deported with his father to a Nazi concentration camp.  He escaped and hid for three years before joining the Soviet army as a cook.  After World War II, Appelfeld spent several months in a displaced persons camp in Italy before immigrating to Palestine in 1946, \n\nMost of his work focuses on Jewish life in Europe before, during and after World War II, but it is not simple autobiography.  Silence, muteness and stuttering are motifs that run through much of his work, and disability often becomes a source of strength and power.   Philip Roth, writing in the New York Times, described Appelfeld as &quot;a displaced writer of displaced fiction, who has made of displacement and disorientation a subject uniquely his own.&quot;\n\nHis many literary honors include the Bialik Prize (1979), the Israel Prize (1983), and the National Jewish Book Award for fiction (1989).\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB or PDF format as noted:\n\n* ALL WHOM I HAVE LOVED (Schocken, 2007).
